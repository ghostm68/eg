FOREWORD 


Having spent a good many years as a teacher, I 
see very clearly that education is of critical im- 
portance m the rapidly changing conditions m 
which the world's peoples now live The task of 
education is to acquaint people, especially 
young people, with the total tradition of human 
thought and experience But, today, it is espe- 
cially important that our minds remain unclut- 
tered ana free of the laborious memorization of 
thousands of facts and figures Our students 
must keep their minds clear and agile, for their 
task IS to wrestle with the evolving concepts to 
which all the recently gathered knowledge 
— generated by new critical insights — is inevi- 
tably leading. The valuable facts of man's past, 
accumulated over thousands of years, must be 
preserved, however, as the basis for new con- 
cepts 

The preservation of these facts and their easy re- 
trieval IS the function of the encyclopedia, just 
as their interpretation is part of the function of 
the school The encyclopedia, intended from 
the time of the ancient Greeks to contain the 
sum total of all knowledge, is still a basic tool of 
education, that human process through which 
the creative imagination is stimulated and made 
productive. One important element in this vital 
process is the development of useful and con- 
structive habits of mind the deepening of intel- 
lectual curiosity, the development of critical 
faculties, the ability to evaluate a discussion, es- 
pecially for logical progression and consistency; 
and the development of the intellectual self- 
confidence that comes from the feeling that 
one can apply acquired knowledge construc- 
tively and rewardingly The encyclopedia is es- 
sential in supporting this development 
The scholars of the Renaissance believed that it 
lay within the realm of possibility for a man to 
learn all knowledge within his own lifetime. 
Today, even the most gifted scholar realizes that 
a man cannot grasp the entire macrocosm of 
known facts And, with the electronic assistance 
of computers and their unimaginable memories, 
the world's knowledge is multiplying so rapidly 
that the work of encyclopedia editors has be- 
come one of selection and organization rather 
than one of gathering only. 


The producers of a modern encyclopedia must, 
therefore, enlist the aid of people who are uni- 
quely knowledgeable m the evergrowing num- 
ber of special fields Each specialist writes about 
the subject he knows thoroughly What all the 
specialists have written, once gathered and col- 
lated, IS then carefully edited Illustrations and 
graphs accompany the text to clarify it and to 
make it more useful Finally, it is fitted into an 
overall plan, the purpose of which is to help 
people easily find correct and readable informa- 
tion 

As an educator who has used encyclopedias for 
years, I know that, they must be accurate, objec- 
tive, and free from prejudice if they are to fulfill 
the needs of students as well as those of the 
casual reader Although encyclopedias differ 
considerably in certain ways, all strive to pro- 
vide the reader with information on a multitude 
of subjects Some encyclopedias are designed to 
provide very detailed information; others are 
prepared exclusively for children; still others 
limit their scope to one area of knowledge or 
concern The Funk & Wagnalls New Encyclope- 
dia has been designed as a general encyclope- 
dia, not giving preference to any one field but 
providing a well-balanced variety of informa- 
tion on questions of contemporary concern 
The adult reader will find the encyclopedia an 
indispensable companion throughout his life 
The student will find here the facts required for 
his studies, reading, and discussion 
The name Funk & Wagnalls has become synony- 
mous with the American image of dependable 
reference works The Funk & Wagnalls New En- 
cyclopedia, It seems to me, has been designed 
and edited in this tradition. It is consistently re- 
liable, fascinatingly illustrated, and easy to use. I 
am sure that this Funk & Wagnalls New Encyclo- 
pedia will, as did Its predecessors, long hold an 
honored place and a well deserved reputation 
among English-speaking people everywhere as 
outstanding among reference books

ENCYCLO- 

PEDIA 



PREFACE 


The enormous strides taken in recent years by 
scientists, technologists, and educators have 
changed the world These advances have also 
posed a major challenge to those who record 
knowledge It is therefore apparent that an en- 
cyclopedia planned for the 1960's will not fulfill 
today's needs To meet this challenge, the late 
Dr Joseph Laffan Morse, Editor in Chief 
(1946-69) of Funk & Wagnalls encyclopedias for 
nearly a quarter of a century, planned the Funk 
8c Wagnalls New Encyclopedia. The full realiza- 
tion of Dr Morse's program was left to his long- 
time associate and successor Editor m Chief 
(1969-75), the late William H Hendelson 
Dr Morse's goal was to create an encyclopedia 
that is authoritative and comprehensive, that 
presents an unbiased view of the world, past 
and present, and that is priced low enough to be 
within the reach of the general public At the 
same time this encyclopedia must qualify as a 
work of value for every member of the family. 
Years of planning and evaluation went into the 
fulfillment of this goal 

To set the guidelines for preparation of the new 
encyclopedia, Dr Morse posed— and, we be- 
lieve, answered— two vital questions 
"How should an encyclopedia be written to 
serve all Americans for school and home use?" 
"What subjects are most likely to be looked up 
today by students and readers of varied inter- 
ests?" 

Let us turn to Dr Morse's first question, that of 
broad-based usefulness A modern general ref- 
erence work must be both easy and rewarding 
to read Excessive technical detail on a subject, 
rather than adding to coverage, tends to make 
an encyclopedia cumbersome and difficult to 
read. The Funk & Wagnalls New Encyclopedia, 
therefore, has been concisely written in non- 
technical language equally suited to the student 
or the casual reader interested in a date, a per- 
son, an event, or a place 
Dr Morse's second question, that of subject se- 
lection, required extensive research School cur- 
ricula were carefully analyzed to assure inclu- 
sion of material that provides information and 
answers to questions that come up on home- 


work or study assignments In order to provide 
information for home and business use, library 
and other relevant sources were examined The 
material was organized into categories, with ma- 
jor emphasis divided among the following his- 
tory and biography; cities, states, countries, and 
other geographic subjects, the sciences, includ- 
ing mathematics, medicine, and health, and 
general subjects, including law, education, so- 
cial sciences, literature, and the arts 
The resulting articles are presented to the reader 
in each volume in the familiar, easy-to-use al- 
phabetical order In the front matter to volume 
one, the Foreword provides us with the educa- 
tor's view of what we should expect from the 
encyclopedia On pages 49-64 the essay On the 
Origins and Purposes of Thinking examines our 
society's methods of utilizing the unique human 
attribute of thought, the origins of those meth- 
ods, and the potential for change that may stem 
from such studies On pages 81-83 the system 
by which the encyclopedia is arranged— a sys- 
tem designed to simplify the process of finding 
information— IS explained in the Guide to the 
Use of the Funk & Wagnalls New Encyclopedia 
Here the extensive cross-references used 
throughout this encyclopedia are carefully ex- 
plained, as are all of the useful features of this 
encyclopedia. 

Among the outstanding features of this encyclo- 
pedia IS the inclusion in each article of certain 
supplementary information For example, per- 
sons mentioned m an account are identified by 
nationality, profession, or accomplishments 
Cross-references are made to individual biogra- 
phies, or life dates are included in parentheses 
When technical terms are used they are imme- 
diately explained to lessen the need for further 
search 

The selection of pictures, illustrations, drawings, 
charts, diagrams, and maps was considered of 
special importance for the inclusion of informa- 
tion most suitably presented in pictorial and 
graphic terms Full color and black and white 
illustrations and color accents have been used 
throughout the text Pictures were carefully 
gathered from museums, archives, and special 



collections throughout the world to provide ex- 
plicit visual information that complements or 
provides added information to the text 
The editors have also prepared a two-volume 
Index including more than 193,000 references, 
intended to broaden the usefulness of this ency- 
clopedia and to enhance its value One of these 
volumes also contains a Bibliography to provide 
the reader with sources of additional informa- 
tion on a great variety of subjects he may wish 
to pursue m greater depth 
In order to keep the new encyclopedia up to 
date and the owners abreast of events, the Funk 
& Wagnalls Yearbook is published annually as m 
the past for previous Funk & Wagnalls encyclo- 
pedias. The Yearbook covers the oustandmg 
events and developments that have taken place 
each year and conforms to the same alphabeti- 
cal arrangement and style as the encyclopedia 
The Funk & Wagnalls New Encyclopedia directly 
reflects the talents of the men and women in- 
volved in Its preparation. The firm of Funk & 
Wagnalls dates back to 1876 Complementing 
this experience is the authority of specialists re- 
inforced by hundreds of contributors and con- 
sultants These are distinguished men and 
women who have risen to the top of their pro- 
fessions, many affiliated with governments, aca- 


demic institutions, universities, museums, li- 
braries, learned societies, industrial firms, 
publications, and international bodies 
They have worked zealously with the editors to 
ensure that articles are current and factually cor- 
rect The publishers are deeply indebted to all of 
these dedicated people, although space permits 
including only some of their names m the 39- 
page listings beginning on page 10 of this vol- 
ume Their efforts assure the accuracy and ob- 
jectivity of the new work, qualities for which 
past Funk & Wagnalls encyclopedias have been 
cited by eminent reviewers and critics as well as 
by literary organizations and specialized institu- 
tions 

Many articles in the encyclopedia are signed, 
particularly those on major subject areas and ar- 
ticles dealing with specialized fields. The un- 
signed articles are the work of an experienced 
staff of writers and editors, well versed and su- 
pervised by expert advisers 
This, then, is the concentrated labor of several 
years and the sum of the work of many It is 
with pride that we present an encyclopedia con- 
ceived to meet the challenges of today— the 
Funk & Wagnalls New Encyclopedia

Let us imagine a very large screen in a dark theater. We enter 
this theater and see nothing In order to see images playing over 
the screen's surface, we must bring in a projector of our own 
and shine its light on the screen in front of us. 

Our screen displays the whole of the human condition— 
what men and women have thought and felt and done 
over thousands of years and in every part of the world. The 
projector is the thinking mind We do not really know how 
large this screen is or just how it might fully be illuminated. We 
sense that seeing the entire screen, knowing what the length 
and breadth of the human condition are, would be deeply 
important to us. And we sense that our having a source of 
illumination that could cast a broad light over all of the screen 
so that we might see it whole, and at the same time focus 
intensely on any part of the screen we choose — that so 
achieving the mind's full powers would be comparably 
important. 

Our purpose in the following pages will be to attempt a 
definition of the boundaries of the human condition and 
to map some of the uses and possibilities of the fully 
comprehending mind

Human beings biologically Uke us have 
lived on this planet for 40,000 years. 
Over this span of time, many cultural 
differences have distinguished one human 
group from another, but there has been no 
difference in our fundamental nature. We have 
been preoccupied with about the same needs all 
this time, and we have met these needs with 
about the same mental and physical equip- 
ment, even though we have met them dif- 
ferently. We are born and become 
parents, in turn, we think about grow- 
ing up, friendship and kinship, the 
natural world, eating, sex, dreaming, 
and dying; we work out our days so 
that we will remember more satis- 
fying times than painful ones. For 
the last 5000 or 6000 of these 40,000 
years, such preoccupations and 
needs have been expressed in a set 
of institutions we call ''civilization" 
For the 35,000 years before civiliza- 
tion, the preoccupations appear in 
a different light and the needs are 
addressed in quite different ways But 
precivilization" shows us different cul- 
tures, not different human beings Perhaps 
the extraordinarily long-lived cultures of pre- 
civilization can offer us new contexts for think- 
ing about what serves life and what defeats it 
in our own, civilized cultures 



Probably the most important context for thinking about civiliza- 
tion IS a historical and philosophical one- What is the "fundamen- 
tal nature" of humankind? Here the longevity of precivilization 
will help us The basic arrangements of life during these 35,000 
years must represent something close to that fundamental nature. 
Surely life m precivilized times was a mixed and complex 
enterprise, as it is now, but we can pick out themes and emphases 
in that mixed condition that differ from our own. 

Precivilized communities appear to have been founded on 
kinship and the principle of increase Persons defined themselves 
not as citizens of nations or participants in professions or religions, 
but as members of kin-groups Kinship reciprocity and generosity 
held precivilized groups together, and concentration on fertility 
and growth tied groups to the earth Social, political, and 
economic institutions, relationships to nature, and such central 
creative traditions as myth, poetry, and ritual all tended to show 
kinship and reciprocity, increase and fertility as great themes. 
Consequently, we can take this thematic cluster as a historical and

philosophical context for examining our own time, where another 
cluster predominates 

The first biologically modern human beings lived in small bands 
of roving, hunting-and-gathering kin-groups. Afi^r yearf 

with the invention of agriculture by the women ft tH8 j3aWs,lffe 
earliest farming villages appeared, and humankirfc settfcd'down. 
Precivilized villagers remained kinship-organized and peace-pre- 
serving for 5000 years. The ways in which groufl decisions were 
made, the necessities of life exchanged, and coll4:tiife expressive- 
ness encouraged— all served the objectives of vilii^fiSBS’

The origins of our own ways of making group decisions, 
exchanging necessities, and otherwise expressing ourselves can be 
located with some certainty We were formed about 5500 years 
ago in the southern plain of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. There 
the first cities in human history grew up. They transformed the 
men and women who lived in them. We come in a direct line from 
these people 

Let us assume that a "language of peace-preservation" had 
functioned at the deepest level of earlier band and village life. 
Such a language would not have possessed an elaborate apparatus 
for intervention and control in the affairs of persons or the 
processes of nature, its complexity would have lam elsewhere, in 
fine discriminations of kinship and in expressions of the principle 
of increase It is of the utmost importance to understand that the 
earliest cities were nearly always at war with one another and in 
internal turmoil This kind of violence has its language as well, a 
language precisely of intervention and control. The actual struc- 
tures of speaking and thought changed in the chronically violent 
cities, slowly arming the cities' managers with the tools for 
organizing both persons and nature in unprecedented ways. The 
new linguistic instruments virtually forced relationships between 
persons into the pattern of win-loss contests. Civilized contests 
are often subtle, and they are often entered voluntarily, but they 
usually tend to a simple and less-than-humane outcome One 
contestant wins and the other loses Connections with nature 
came to show the same contestual features, until we can speak of 
"defeating" a mountain and "conquering" space. In more and 
more instances, contest replaced both kinship and increase as the 
basis of socfal relationships and relationships to nature. 


52 


The longest tradition of a language of control may be found in 
the law. Precivilization, without a language of control, and 
ordered by the unchanging custom of kinship obligation, required 
no legal systems. We must look at why laws became necessary m 
civilizations and at how they were made. What most strongly 
differentiates the city, where civilized institutions are strongest, 
from the band or village is that kinship obligations are shattered 
by the city's managers and replaced by obligations to those 
managers The new loyalty is to a stranger, and for that reason 
alone it must often be enforced coercively. It is advantageous to 
civilizations to create whole populations of strangers, both to 
make the new loyalty appear less strange and further to dissolve 
kinship bonds. 

The city wishes to administer its directives without lapse m 
order to assert its continuing dominion over kinship This raises 
the problem of equipping a permanent group of administrators Hammurabi 

They will be busy and among strangers, so they will need easily sm god, Shamash The 
memorizable rules, applicable quickly and in all circumstances. x^fb^iow"'ifthe ear' 
The first such rules that have been uncovered by Uest wntten body of laws 


archeologists take the following form: 

If any person does this thing, anywhere and at 
any time, that person will be guilty of a crime. 

Now a law enforcer sees a particular person 
doing that very thing, at a particular time and 
place. He makes the following inference- 

I. If anyone does that, anywhere and 
anytime, he is guilty of a crime. 

II. That person over there is doing that. 

III. That person is guilty of a crime. 



He then arrests him Obvious to us, but when 
this pattern of thought became institution- 


alized the human world was decisively 
changed. In the kinship social order, justice 
had been in the hands of men and women 
who knew the wrongdoer. Judgment grew 
out of years of experience shared by the 
judges and the judged. The city's judgment, 
levied quickly and among strangers, de- 
pended not upon a mass of concrete details 
but upon an abstract pattern of inference: 

I. A universal statement: Xis the case 
everywhere, all the time. 

II. A particular statement: This particular 
a is an X.

I 




III. The conclusion: This particular a is the case. 



This pattern was probably first raised to eminence 5500 years 
ago, when city populations had to be ordered in a new way 
Twenty-five hundred years ago, the pattern was applied with 
extraordinary force to nature: In the 6th century BC, in Greece, 
modern science was born Nature was made a stranger in Greece, 
as neighbors had been made strangers 3000 years before in the 
Middle East Abstract operations rendered the estranged world 
manipulatable, just as persons had been rendered manipulatable 
3000 years earlier. 

The law and science together became the principal supports of 
civilized states Behind them both stood the master pattern. 

I. X is the case. 

II. a is an X. 

III. a is the case. 

In the 4th century BC, the Greek philosopher Aristotle gave the 
perfected form of the master pattern to the West. 

One study preceded the division of mind and the world for 
Aristotle- The first interest of the thinker was to be thought itself 




X is the case 
a is an X. 
a is the 
case.

immovable, separable from matter, and not ac- 
cessible to the senses 
B. Natural Sciences, which study objects that are

matter, and accessible to the senses 
C Mathematics, which studies objects 
that are eternal, immovable, 
inseparable from matter, and 
accessible to the senses 
II. Practical Sciences^ the purpose of

B. Politics, the action being 
collective 

111. Prodyctive Sciences, the 
purpose of which Is artifacts 
A. Rhetoric, the artifacts 
being speeches 
B. Poetics, the artifacts being 
poems and plays 


Aristotle's legacy to the West has been his conception of correct 
thinking, grounded m two principles. 

1. precision — ^that a word have one and only one meaning 

2. order— that a group of words, usually making up sentences, 
must show a correct order or syntax; and that groups of 
sentences, when they are arranged in arguments, must show 
the correct higher order, the master pattern 

Notice that Aristotle's system comprises a preliminary study and 
three sciences Each science has a different purpose For Plato, 
Aristotle's great predecessor, all knowing was to one purpose only, 
which he called "the good" Plato had expressed a powerful 
sentiment of unification, Aristotle of division. Since the 4th 
century BC, thinking persons have oscillated between Plato's One 
and Aristotle's Many. 

Whatever we might think about putting the natural sciences or 
politics where Aristotle put them in his system, he made distinc- 
tions in exactly the same way we make them. Observe how the 
objects studied by the theoretical sciences are differentiated from 
one another Two objects may be accessible to the senses and they 
may both be "inseparable from matter", but if one object is 
perishable and the other is eternal, they belong to two different 
theoretical sciences. This kind of distinction-making effectively 
separates objects into bins for special study, and it requires us to 
abstract qualities, like eternality, from objects To the forceful 
imperatives (1) to make distinctions, and (2) to value abstraction, 
Aristotle adds the imperative (3) to rank or subordinate. The 
theoretical sciences, for example, are better than the practical 
sciences for Aristotle, and among the theoretical sciences, basic 
philosophy is better than the natural sciences and mathematics. 

No turn was taken away from precision and order, distinction- 
making, abstracting, and ranking by Aristotle's successors, even 
though many other systems-of-the-world followed his. In the 17th 
century, in England, John Locke, Thomas Hobbes, and Sir Isaac 
Newton set the modern terms for precise, mathematical sciences 
of mind, society, and nature By the end of the 19th century, it 
seemed that mathematical laws would be found for a complete 
world system, locating mind in society and society in nature. Thus 
was an uneasy unity restored to Western thought; Ways would 
continue to be found to separate disciplines in the Aristotelian 
spirit, but they would be brought together by their Platonic search 
for universal, mathematical laws. Aristotle would be partially 
reconciled with Plato. We can see the fruits of the reconciliation 
everywhere around us, in primary- and secondary-school curric- 
ula, in the organization of colleges and universities, and in our 
own mental furniture.

tail from the "School of 
Athens" by Raphael

There are a great many ways to discuss modern modes of 
thought We shall pursue only one, not because it is clearly the 
best way, but because it is economical and it will permit us to look 
backward, especially to Aristotle, and forward, to new ways of 
construing mind and the world. What we shall do is distinguish 

1. sequential ways of thinking from 

2. cross-sectional ways of thinking. 

These two modes are sometimes observed or practiced in their 
pure forms, but most frequently we find them mixed together. Our 
intention will be carefully to sort out sequential from cross-sec- 
tional modes of thought, so that we can then put them together in 
an unfamiliar and fruitful way 


A Sequence 

A IS an archaic harp Its frame is upright, and its 
strings are plucked by hand is a harpsichord A 
large harp-frame is laid down and its strings plucked 
by quills, which are activated from a keyboard. Cis a 
modern piano. Now the harp-frame is quite heavy, 
and Its strings are tightly stretched across it. These 
strings are not plucked but hit with hammers The 
hammers are also activated from a keyboard, like the 
quills in a harpsichord D is an electronic synthesizer 
We retain the keyboard, but the harp-frame and 
strings are gone, replaced by electronic tone- 
producers The four instruments follow one another 
in the history of musical-instrument invention 


A Cross-Section 
We now examine the 
harpsichord closely It is 
being played in an 
appropriate 18 th-century 
setting. We could radiate 
outward from this scene 
to include more and 
more of 18 th-century 
European life

gang Amadeus Mozart

de Conti Painting by Mi- 
chel Barthelemy Gilmer 




The arrow pointing to the right in the illustration represents our 
common-sense notion of time. Any situation A is earlier than B; D 
IS later than C A, B, C, and D are also different from one another 
To change the example, let us say that A stands for the condition 
of the American colonies before the Revolution, B for the years of 
the Revolution, C for the republic in the 19th century, and D for 
present-day America. They are all different in a great many ways 
Historians sort these ways into economic differences, political 
differences, literary differences, and so on. They normally speak 
about continuities and discontinuities as they move from A to B to 
C to D in a language of change and difference over time. We shall 
call all of this sequential thinking 



Now let us extract B from the series and enlarge it. We shall not 
here be interested in how B emerged from A, or how C will 
emerge from B. We are absorbed by the detailed structure of B. 
We have taken B out of time, so we cannot use a language of 
change-over-time to talk about it. Since our interest is in the more 
and more refined details of thfe cross section, we will range on and 
about the plane cut by B. The example from the history of 
musical-instrument invention can be used to reveal important and 
hidden features of 18th-century Western culture. The harpsi- 
chord's physical construction suited it to sounding many melodies 
at once, with equal emphasis. The later piano, with its new means 
for changing emphases, often subordinated fewer musical materi- 
als to one melody. The harpsichord's construction consequently 
points to how 18th-century Europeans actually heard, and it 
suggests that they heard differently from us. Moving from an 
instrument's design to facts of human perception, all in one 
moment of time, is an act of cross-sectional thinking. 


57 



An analogy to one of our commonest experiences may illustrate 
the differences between a "language of change", carrying sequen- 
tial insights, and a "language of structure", carrying cross-sectional 
insights. Imagine that we have gone to a film and are talking about 
It We are discussing the coherence of the characters in the film 
and the plausibility of its plot. These are the kinds of questions we 
might also raise of a novel or a history book They are questions 
appropriate to sequential thought But one of us is interested m 
aspects of filmmaking that the others do not pay much attention 
to. She saw the film a second time under circumstances in which 
she could stop the projector when she wished What remained on 
the screen when she did stop the projector was a single frame. 
There was no motion then, no development of character or plot, 
only the shapes and shadows 
on the one frame. She, unlike us, 
talks about composition, 
relationships among textures, 
masses, and lines She contem- 
plates a static moment, extracted 
from time and change. Hers is 
the discourse of cross-sectional 
thought 

We can divide the courses 
taught in typical secondary 
schools and colleges roughly into cross-sectional and sequential 
disciplines. The social sciences, like sociology and anthropology, 
take modern or premodern societies at a single moment in time 
and ask structural questions about them. The questions tend to 
be neutral and systematic, we are not expected to admire a 
premodern society on reading an anthropologist's account of 
It, so much as to achieve an analytic understanding of it The 
natural sciences, like biology and physics, show both cross- 
sectional and sequential aspects One may study the fine 
structures of a flower on the one hand — again, not to admire 
the flower but to know it analytically — or one may study the 
flower's growth from bud to maturity. It is preeminently 
history, of course, that asks sequential questions. As it 
happens, there have been both "proper" and "improper" 
sequential questions in the history of thought 
The kind of sequential explanation a historian or historical 
biologist can offer has almost always been intensely 
contested In most sequential disciplines, successive 






states-of-af fairs used to be connected in the way means are 
connected to ends They now tend to be connected as causes and 
effects. Day-to-day thinking makes continuous use of both kinds 
of sequencing We "plan for the future", or imagine desirable 
ends We then try to act in order to bring those ends about So our 
acts are often means to imagined ends But we use our knowledge 
of causes and effects to make those acts consequential in a 
cause-and-effect world. 

If we take the sequential and cross-sectional postures toward 
the multiple worlds in which we live— the interior world; the 
social worlds extending outward from the family; the inanimate, 
technical world; and the animate, natural world— if we hold these 
two orientations firmly in mind, then we can imagine them 
brought into a special relationship. To paraphrase the French 
philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre, we can imagine the cross-sectional 
disciplines being reintegrated into the sequential disciplines We 
can then contemplate the possibility of thinking about the 
stopped frame and the film at the same time, which is to say, we 
can move toward inserting the psychological cross section into the 
sociological 
cross section, 
and then 
fitting the 
sociological 
cross section 
into a 

generously conceived history, an act of thought that might 
transform our conceptions of mind and the world. 



59 





The remarkable possibility of thinking m more than one way, 
not in succession but at the same time, requires a shift m where to 
look for analogies It is difficult to imagine seeing both the 
stopped frame and the film, but we encounter an altogether 
different physiology when we turn to hearing Another French 
philosopher, Claude Levi-Strauss, once remarked that music might 
someday offer a model for a more adequate kind of thinking Let 
us imagine that we are hearing one melody, which rises in pitch 



and swells in volume 



and diminishes. 



Most of us can only hear one melody at a time But— and this is 
the important point — we can be taught to hear several melodies at 
once 


60 



This way of regarding music would merely be an interesting 
exercise if it were not that almost anyone can be led from hearing 
a single melody to truly hearing several melodies and their 
harmonies simultaneously Aural space is thus "filled" If we were 
to ask experienced listeners how they feel while listening to great 
music, we would find that for them, this "full hearing" is 
synonymous with a profound variety of happiness 


Even the distinction between cross sectional and sequential orderings of the world ultimately 
comes from Aristotle As well as projxising his preliminary study and three sciertces, Anstotle 
gave a methodical definition of what it was to know something 1 know an object"' only 
when I can give four accounts of it The accounts are 

1 about the material of the object what it is made of, 

2 about the form of the object, its shape, 

3 about the activities imm^iately responsible for the object s 

having assumed its shape, and 

4 about the purpose of the activities causing the object 

to assume its shape, and the purpose of the object 
If we examine the four accounts closely, we will find 
that cross-sectional studies are of the first and second kinds 
They deal with forms, matenals, and relationships 
considered at one moment Sequential studies are of 
the third and fourth kinds They either deal with causes 
and effects over a period of time as do Aristotle s 
third accounts or with means and ends over a period 
of time, as do his fourth accounts

Symbolic History How do people confer meaning on the 
parts of the world? How do they create? 


Is there a condition of profound intellectual happiness accom- 
panying "full thinking"? If we were to represent sequential 
disciplines as melodies and cross-sectional disciplines as har- 
monies, perhaps, after a patient apprenticeship, we could begin to 
think the disciplines simultaneously, filling intellectual space, and 
feeling intellectual happiness. 

If sequential and cross-sectional explanations could be brought 
together, let us say on the model of a fully heard piece of music, 
the parts of the Aristotelian conception of knowing would be 
made a whole In this synthesis, we of course stay in the civilized 
realm of precision and order, abstractions, distinctions, and 
subordinations. But music has pointed to a larger synthesis, and 
the continued study of personal and cultural precivilization will 
give us the remaining materials for it We can guess, at least, at the 
consequences for our lives of bringing the parts of civilized 
thinking together to form a whole, and of then bringing this whole

together with precivilized modes of thought, to form the fully 
human whole. 

We will have the breadth and continuity of human mental life 
back — not just 5000 or 2000 years, in the Middle East and Europe, 
but 40,000 years, over Eurasia, Africa, and the Americas The 
modern world is locked into what appears to be an overwhelming 
combination of troubles — epidemic loneliness and murderous 
contests on every scale, environmental exhaustion and overpopu- 
lation We urgently need models for repositioning ourselves 
toward such crises, or else we may fail our children in a tragic, 
even if well-meaning, way If our notions of the human condition 
and of thinking are drawn into civilized times and their positions 
toward persons and nature, we may not be able to maintain our 

good faith to the next generation. 
But all the models we will ever 
need are on that screen we 
imagined, displaying its 40,000 
years of human experience. 
And all the illumination we will 
ever need can be supplied by 
our minds working wholly.

We must probably step quite far backward, not forward, if we 
are to guarantee the future of this planet Backward in personal 
history, to repossess childhood reverie and imagination, bringing 
them forward to join the problem-solving apparatus of adulthood 
And backward in cultural history to repossess precivilized kinship 
and Its imagination, its reveries of increase We cannot replace 
adult problem-solving and civilized law and science, nor do we 
wish to A satisfactorily inclusive conception of mind would give 
us reveries and the Aristotelian master pattern We want to 
analyze the biologist's flower, but it is also the child's flower, and 
we left Its beauty out. We need it back, we need equally to 
daydream over it We can have kinship and the law The 
wrenching loneliness of which no one speaks can be spoken and 
understood, if our imaginations are released by the dynamisms of 
kinship. It can be overcome. The law and modern styles of 
governance can be reexamined in a much enlarged intellectual 
and historical context When they are situated correctly, the 
likelihood of their being put to increasingly humane purposes will 
be greater We can have increase and science. This juxtaposition 
probably appears strange, but it is exact. The words that make up a 
science are precise and ordered in conformation with Aristotle's 
two principles of correct thinking These words cannot change, let 
alone increase, in meaning, they must remain attached to single 
meanings It is just the special feature of the words associated with 
childhood reveries and precivilized myths that they do increase 
their meanings The repossession of our origins, of reverie and 
kinship and increase, and their placement beside our present 
historical moment, to constitute one human condition and a 
genuine fullness of mind toward it— this may be the project of 
thinking in the 20th century

GUIDE TO THE USE OF 
THE FUNK & WAGNALLS 
NEW ENCYCLOPEDIA 


The word "'guide" means to point out the way tor — to 
direct on a course— to conduct — to lead It implies the 
showing of the way by one who is thoroughly familiar 
with the route and connotes his continuous presence 
or direction along the way Thus, we have called this 
section a guide It was written by the editors who pre- 
pared the Funk & Wagnalls New Encyclopedia, and it is 
intended to show the best possible way to use their 
newest reference work 

SPECIAL GUIDEPOSTS 

iightface normal type used in printing, characterized 
by letters of usual thickness This entire sentence ex- 
cept for three boldface words is printed in Iightface 

boldface, a darker "bolder" type, characterized by let- 
ters with thick heavy lines This entire sentence except 
for two words is printed in boldface. 

Italic: a special type, characterized by letters that slant 
upward to the right Italic is used to give emphasis to 
special terms or to indicate foreign words or phrases 

article or entry name given to the complete body of 
text dealing with a specific topic 

article title, the name of the entry, always printed in 

BOLDFACE CAPITAL LETTERS

within an article, usually printed in boldface. 

cross-reference: a direction to the reader to go to an- 
other article in the encyclopedia for more or related in- 
formation about the topic 

running head: name of the first major article in the left 
column on a left-hand page and the last major article 
in the right column on a right-hand page Running 
heads are printed in large capital letters and are useful 
aids in finding a particular entry within a volume 

ORDER OF ARRANGEMENT 

The articles in the encyclopedia are arranged in simple 
alphabetical order through each word spelled in 
BOLDFACE CAPITAL LETTERS m the entry title The al- 
phabetical order is not affected by intervening punctu- 
ation or by spaces between the words 
BIBLE

If different topics are known by the same name, the 
entries are placed in the order of things, places, and 
persons 

MERCURY, metallic element [thing] 

MERCURY, smallest planet in the 
solar system . [place] 

MERCURY, in Roman mythology, messenger 

of the gods [personage] 

THINGS 

The category "things" includes every subject except 
persons or places If the name ot a thing consists of 
more than one w'ord, the word order has been inverted 
so that the first significant word in the name deter- 
mines Its alphabetical arrangement 
BASEBALL HALL OF FAME AND MUSEUM, 
NATIONAL 

JENKINS' EAR, WAR OF 
MASSACHUSETTS, UNIVERSITY OF 
PSYCHOLOGY, EXPERIMENTAL 
STAR-SPANGLED BANNER, THE 

The boldface words A, AN, and THE, when part of an 
inverted title do not affect the alphabetical order of 
the entry 

ALAMO, THE, former Franciscan mission 
ALAMOGORDO, town m New Mexico 

Different things with the same name. W hen different 
things are known by the same name, the article about 


81 



the anjmate thing comes before the article about the 
inanimate thing 

CRANE, common name for the largest of 
wading birds [animate] 

CRANE, machine for moving heavy objects 

[inanimate] 

Related things with the same name. Things with the 
same name that are somewhat related have been 
grouped together under one title For example, see 
ACT OF UNION in this volume Each of the four acts is 
discussed as a separate subject marked by a boldface 
subject heading. 

Terms used in more than one field. A term applicable 
in more than one field is sometimes discussed in a sin- 
gle entry For example, see ADMIRALTY in this volume 
Each sense of the title is marked by a boldface number 

PLACES 

The category "places" includes political units, for 
example, countries, States, and cities, and natural fea- 
tures, such as mountains, rivers, and capes 

Duplication of place-names. Political units with the 
same name are arranged in the order of countries, fol- 
lowed by States, provinces, departments, and regions, 
followed by counties and shires, followed by cities, 
followed by boroughs, towns, villages, and smaller 
units Pc^ilitical units in the United States appear before 
political units elsewhere in the world In the United 
States, two similarly named places ot equal political 
importance appear in the alphabetical order of their 
respec live States 

ABERDEEN, city tn South Dakota 
ABERDEEN, city and seaport of Washing- 
ton 

ABERDEEN, residential town of Maryland 
ABERDEEN, Great Britain, county in ne Scot- 
land 

ABERDEEN, Great Britain, city and county 
town of Aberdeen County, Scotland 

Places with the same name located outside the United 
States appear in alphabetical order by nation Ancient 
place-names come betore mcxiern place-names 

SYDNEY, city and principal port of Austra- 
lia 

SYDNEY; city and seaport of Canada 
CORINTH, city of ancient Greece 
CORINTH, city of Greece 

Natural features. Natural features with the same name 
follow the political units The names ot natural features 
are entered as indicated by the following examples 

CAPE OF GOOD HOPE, name of two 
promontories . 

EVEREST, MOUNT 
MICHIGAN, LAKE 
NILE, river of Africa 

Alternate and former names. Alternate and former 
place-names are printed in DISTINCTIVE LIGHTFACE 
TYPE m the artic !e title 

LENINGRAD, formerly SAINT PETERSBURG 
(1703-1914) and PETROCRAD (1914-24), city of 


the Soviet Union 

THESSALIA, commonly THESSALY 
PERSONS 

The category "persons" includes (1) biographies deal- 
ing with the life of a single person, and (2) grouped 
biographies, that is, entries containing several biogra- 
phies that, because of an important relationship, have 
been grouped together under the same title 

In the article title of a single-person biography, the 
person's name is inverted so that the tamily, or' last 
name appears first The full name, including any mid- 
.dle names and titles of nobility, is given in boldface 

CHURCHILL, Sir Winston Leonard Spencer 

If a first or middle name is not commonly used, it is 
shown in parentheses 

WILSON, (Thomas) Woodrow 

If only an initial is commonly used, the remainder of 
the name is enclosed in parentheses 

ELIOT, T(homas) S(tearns) 

People with the same name. When two or more peo- 
ple have the same name, the entries are arranged in the 
following order saints, popes, emperors and kings, ti- 
tled persons, families, other 

Saints and popes. The biography of a saint is entered 
at the saint's name For examples, see AGNES, Saint in 
this volume and AQUINAS, Saint Thomas m Volume 2 
Important popes having the same name have been 
grouped m chronological order under a single title, 
that ot their pontifical name For example see ALEX- 
ANDER in this volume 

Emperors and kings. Important rulers with the same 
name are grouped together under one title, that of 
their given name A grouped-ruler entry is first sec- 
tioned alphabetically by kingdom or country Within 
each of these political divisions, the rulers are then ar- 
ranged chronologically For example, see ALFONSO m 
this volume 

Rulers of great historic importance also have separate 
more detailed articles Readers may consult the 
grouped-ruler entry first It will either itself contain 
complete biographical information or indicate that a 
special separate biography on the ruler follows 

Families and dynasties. Famous members of a family 
or a dynasty have been grouped chronologically under 
one article title, that of the family or dynastic name 
For example, see KENNEDY in Volume 15 Every Presi- 
dent of the United States, however, has his own sepa- 
rate biography, see KENNEDY, John Fitzgerald, also in 
Volume 15 

Pseudonyms. A biography of a person known by a 
pseudonym may be entered at either the subject's real 
name or his pseudonym A cross-reference from the 
lesser known name to the better known ensures the 
reader's finding the biography 

TWAIN, Mark. See Clemens, Samuel Langhorne 

Confusing spellings. Names beginning A/, f/, De, 
Della, Du, Des, L', La, Le, Les, Van, and Von have been 
entered according to the accepted usage, the reader 
should look under each possibility Names beginning 
M', Mac, and Me have been entered appropriately into 
the simple alphabetical order of the encyclopedia

finding facts 

The articles in the encyclopedia are organized so that 
one entry otfers the same kind and order of intorma* 
tion as another article in the same field Articles on 
similar political units are alike in their structure, tor 
example, the pattern of the ALABAMA article corre- 
sponds to that used for each ot the other forty-nine 
States Similarly, articles dealing with plant and animal 
life parallel each other in scheme, the description of 
MAPLE can be compared with that of OAK, and the 
coverage of RABBIT with that of SQUIRREL. Patterns 
have been followed also for the other sciences and for 
religious, political, and biographical articles 

Alternate names and variant spellings If a topic is 
knov\n bv different names or by a name having differ- 
ent spellings, the more widely used names or spellings 
appear in BOLDFACE CAPITAL LETTERS m the article 
title Lesser known names or spellings are also shown 
in the title but are printed in DISTINCTIVE LIGHTF*\CE 
TYPE 

AIR-CUSHION VEHICLE, or GROUND-EF- 
FECT MACHINE or HOVERCRAFT 

When different names or spellings appear all in BOLD- 
FACE TYPE in the title, it indicates either that both 
names are widely known or that no special spelling ot 
the name is preferred 

LEIDEN or LEYDEN, one of the oldest cities in 
Holland 

Word derivations. Frequently the derivation ot a word 
IS important in understanding its meaning and use 
Word derivation m an entrv' usually shows the lan- 
guage from which the English word is derived and a lit- 
eral translation of the foreign v\ord 
TELEPATHY (Gr tele, patheia, "ieeling") 

Subject headings. Subject headings are used to divide 
longer articles into compact sections Printed m bold- 
face, subject headings indicate w-here the article turns 
from one aspect of the topic to another The reader 
can usually find desired specific information by look- 
ing for the appropriate subject heading within the 
entry 

Abbreviations and accents. The abbreviations found 
in the text are commonly used abbreviations, an ex- 
planatory list appears in the tront of each volume A 
more extended listing, showing abbreviations w'ide!> 
used by authoritative sources in many fields, can be 
found in the article ABBREVIATION. Pertinent charts of 
abbreviations also accompany the articles, BIBLE, 
CANON OF THE; DEGREE, ACADEMIC; ELEMENTS, 
CHEMICAL; MATHEMATICAL SYMBOLS; WEIGHTS 
AND MEASURES. Accent marks and special letters are 
explained in the article DIACRITIC MARK. 

Immediate identification of people. Every person 
mentioned in the text of an article is immediately iden- 
tified by his nationality and his profession or accom- 
plishments The names of people who are not them- 
selves the subject of a separate biography in the 
encyclopedia are followed by specific or approximate 
life dates given in parentheses

CROSS-REFERENCES 

Much careful attention was given to devising the best 
system of cross-references for the encyclopedia Cross- 
references insure the reader's awareness of all other 
entries also pertaining to the article topic Wherever 
possible, the cross-reference has been slotted mto the 
precise spot m the article where a reading of the sug- 
gested entrv would be most beneficial 

Readers are directed to separate entries by the itali- 
cized words see, see a/so, or see u/ider followed bv the 
Article Title is Distisctive Type The article title, in turn, 
may frequently be followed by the specific subject 
heading, m italic type, under which the reader will find 
the intended supplementary information 

In many mammals the color of the skin or fur 
blends with the animahs natural surroundings, 
see Adaptation Protective Coloration 

What does (q.v.) meani 

The abbreviation (q v ) stands for the Latin words 
"quod vide", meaning "which see" The placement of 
this abbreviation immediately after a word — or a name 
or term — signals that the word itself is the title of a 
separate article in the encyclopedia Bv looking up the 
article on this word, or the entries on each word in a 
series followed by the plural (qqv) of the abbrevia- 
tion, the reader will find specific information about the 
words used and additional data about the main topic 
of the article he is reading 


ILLUSTRATIONS 

Whenever possible a blend of text and illustrations has 
been used in the encyclopedia articles Photographs 
were selected either to help explain the topic or to ex- 
tend the text ot an article even further In many of the 
technical and scientific entries, special diagrams were 
draw-n to coordinate with the text 


INDEX AND BIBLIOGRAPHY 

The last two volumes of the encyclopedia comprise an 
index to the text and a supplementarv bibliographv 
The index, of course, is the key to unlocking the encv- 
clopedia Checking a topic there first, rather than 
searching randomly through the volumes, will quicKK 
bring an elusive fact to the reader The bibliography 
points to information outside the encyclopedia, de- 
scribing about 8000 books and periodicals tor further 
reading or extended study ot a topic

A, first letter and first vowel of the English 
alphabet It also is the first letter of most al- 
phabets which, like those of English and other 
Indo-European languages, are derived from the 
ancient Semitic scripts of the Middle East In 
certain Indian and Ethiopic alphabets its posi- 
tion IS different 

The history of the transmission of this letter 
from alphabet to alphabet is still unclear The 
ancient Semitic character from which the mod- 
ern A derives was once thought to be a Phoeni- 
cian invention In the mid-19th century A was 
traced to older sources in Babylonian and Cre- 
tan inscriptions and in Egyptian hieratic and hi- 
eroglyphic scripts (see Hieroglyphics) 

The A-shape apparently originated in a hiero- 
glyphic picture of an eagle, which was called 
ahom in the old Egyptian picture-writing lan- 
guage. The sign later was borrowed by the 
Phoenicians or other Semites from Egyptian cur- 
sive hieratic writing, a rounded, flowing form of 
script m which the letter A had lost its resem- 
blance to the eagle hieroglyph. Its changed ap- 
pearance led the Phoenicians to rename the let- 
ter aleph ("ox"), from a fancied resemblance to 
the head and horns of that animal 

In the Phoenician and other early Semitic al- 
phabets the character aleph was a consonant 
and represented a glottal stop. These early al- 
phabets had consonants only, the presence of 
vowel sounds or values had to be inferred by 
the reader At a later period vowel points, that 
IS, marks placed below, above, or to the side of 
the consonant symbol, were used to indicate 
vowel values. When the Semitic alphabet was 
adopted by the Greeks in the 9th century bc 
certain Semitic consonant symbols were made 
to represent vowel sounds In the earliest Greek 
alphabet aleph became the letter alpha, with 
the value of the long or short ah sound. 

In the 7th century bc the Romans adopted 
the Greek alphabet with modifications The 


Greek letter alpha became the Roman A, and 
this form and its general value were passed on 
to the peoples who later adopted the Roman al- 
phabet In the 9th century ad the Greek alpha 
was incorporated m the Cyrillic alphabet (qv) 
devised by Byzantine missionaries for the 
Slavic-speaking peoples whom they had con- 
verted to Christianity 

The evolutions of the three forms of the letter 
now in use in English, namely the capital, the 
Roman lower case, and the italic and script 
lower case, began at different dates The English 
capital A is identical with the Greek and Roman 
forms of A used in stone carvings It conforms 
more closely than do the A's of other alphabets 
to the primitive Phoenician outline found in in- 
scriptions of the 9th century bc The English 
lowercase italic and script a is derived from the 
Greek and Latin uncial script, a kind of large, 
rounded lettering used as early as the 3rd cen- 
tury BC The uncial script A was also the parent 
form of the Greek minuscule A In the Caroline 
minuscule, a form of lettering derived from the 
Greek minuscule and used chiefly in manu- 
scripts such as those produced in the Frankish 
Empire in the 9th century ad, the head of the 
letter was bent to the left to avoid possible con- 
fusion with the uncial letter d, the a form was 
the result The Frankish manuscripts were stud- 
ied by 14th-century typeface designers, who 
preserved the bent form. It survives in the so- 
called Roman lowercase type commonly used in 
modern printed books The gradual evolution of 
the letter A may be summarized as shown in the 
illustration on page 86 

The earliest known sound represented by a is 
that of the a in father, it was the sound of the 
ancient Greek alpha This ah sound, often called 
the Italian a, is also the name of the letter itself 
in Latin and in all the modern European lan-

much of Africa, from the southern part of Egypt 
to the Cape of Good Hope A nocturnal animal. 
It lives in burrows and feeds entirely on ants and 
termites 

The aardvark is about 5 to 6 ft long and has an 
arched back, a tubular snout, large, upright ears, 
and a fleshy, tapering tail which it uses to throw 
earth back when it burrows The aardvark uses 
Its specialized, chisel-shaped claws to break 
open the hard clay of termite nests, then the 
aardvark uses its sticky tongue to capture the in- 
sects in the nest Unlike other anteaters, which 
are toothless, the aardvark has twenty cylindri- 
cal, rootless teeth which grow continually 
throughout its lifetime, see Anteater 

The female gives birth to a single offspring, 
which digs Its own burrow at the age of six 
months Although timid, the aardvark will fight 
when It cannot flee or burrow to safety, lying on 
Its back. It defends itself with its extremely pow- 
erful claws

buff in color, with an orange tint and dark- 
brown bands At night it leaves its burrow, trav- 
eling singly or m a troop, to forage for carrion 
and insects, especially termites When attacked, 
the aardwolf erects its mane, achieving a formi- 
dable appearance, and ejects a foul-smelli ng 
fluid from its anal gland Having weak jaws and 
small teeth, however, it is unable to fight off 
such enemies as the dog* Toward December the

AARON (fl about 1300 bc), first Jewish high 
priest, and traditional founder of the Hebrew 
priesthood, see High Priest According to the 
Old Testament book of Exodus, Aaron was the 
older brother of Moses, and a direct descendant 
of the tribe of Levi (qq v.). When Moses de- 
clined the mission of delivering the Children of 
Israel from Egyptian bondage, because he was 
"slow of speech", Aaron was appointed his min- 
ister and spokesman (Exod 410-15) He deliv- 
ered the message of Jehovah to the Israelites 
and to the court of the Pharaoh, confirming the 
words of the message by wonderful signs (Exod 
4-12) With Moses, Aaron led the Israelites out 
of Egypt, and in the battle against the Amalek- 
ites (Exod 17), Hur and Aaron held up the hands 
of Moses while he prayed for victory Aaron was 
specially chosen for the office of priest, which 
was to be hereditary in his family (Exod. 28), and 
was formally consecrated At Mt Sinai, when 
Moses and Joshua ascended the mount to re- 
ceive the stone tablets containing the Law, 
Aaron and Hur were left in charge of the Israel- 
ites. The people, dismayed at Moses' long ab- 
sence on the mountain, cried out for a god to 
worship, and Aaron made them a golden calf 
(Exod 32.1-24); he thereby incurred the anger 
of Jehovah, and was pardoned only through the 
intercession of Moses For their doubts (Num 
20), Moses and Aaron were forbidden to enter 
the promised land, Aaron died on Mt Hor, and 
his office was given to his son Eleazar

The Abbey Theatre is a product of the Irish 
cultural revival which began late in the 19th 


century The revival was initiated largely by the 
Irish poet and dramatist William Butler Yeats 
(q v ), who urged Irish writers to draw their in- 
spiration directly from Irish life and traditions 
rather than from British and European sources 
In 1899 Yeats helped to establish the Irish Liter- 
ary Theatre which was reorganized in 1902 as 
the Irish National Theatre Society With finan- 
cial assistance provided by the English theater 
manager Annie Elizabeth Fredericka Horniman 
(1860-1937), the Irish National Theatre Society 
established m 1904 the repertory company 
which became known as the Abbey Theatre, 
and which, since 1924, has received an annual 
government subsidy The new group introduced 
realistic and poetic elements into the Irish thea- 
ter, It soon gained a popular following Notable 
Irish dramatists whose works were presented at 
various times included Yeats, John Millington 
Synge, Lady Augusta Gregory, George William 
Russell, Padraic Colum, St John Greer Ervine, 
and Sean O'Casey (qq v ) Among the favorite 
plays of Abbey audiences w'ere Cathieen ni 
Houlihan (1902) by Yeats, Riders to the Sea 
(1904) and Playboy of the Western World (1907) 
by Synge, and Juno and the Paycock (1924) and 
The Plough and the Stars (1926) by O'Casey The 
quality of their presentations declined after the 
death of Yeats in 1939 In 1951 the Abbey audi- 
torium was severely damaged by fire, and the 
company moved to the Queen's Theatre On 
July 18, 1966, the completely new, 628-seat 
Abbey Theatre was opened on the site of its 
predecessor Below the Abbey foyer is the Pea-

ABBOT, in certain religious orders, the head 
of a monastery or abbey Until the beginning of 
the 10th century the head of every monastery 
was called the abbot, but many of the orders 
founded after that time rejected the title The 
Carthusians, Dominicans, Carmelites, and Au- 
gustinians called the superior prepositor or 
prior, the Franciscans, custos or guardian The 
abbot was always bound to enforce the observ- 
ance of the rules of his order, to administer the 
goods of the monastery, and to exact uncondi- 
tional obedience from his monks In the 10th 
century many of the chief abbeys in Christen- 
dom were under lay abbots The members of 
the royal household received grants of abbeys 
as their maintenance, and the king kept the 
richest for himself In the Orthodox Church the 
superiors of monasteries are called hegumens or 
mandntes, and general abbots, archimandrites

ABBREVIATION, letter or group of letters 
used in writing, printing, and speech to repre- 
sent a word or phrase in shortened form Abbre- 
viations are used to save space and time and to 
avoid pronouncing long words and phrases The 
most common are arbitrary signs or initial letters 
for the words themselves 
Shortened word forms have been in use since 
antiquity, and many current abbreviations have 
come from Latin Most of the arts and sciences 
use symbols as abbreviations, they are univer- 
sally understood Although no specific rule gov- 
erns the formaticfn of abbreviations, certain 
kinds have become standard The most com- 
mon are (1) first and last letters, for example, 
Pa for Pennsylvania, (2) key identifying letters, 
for example, mfg for manufacturing; (3) sylla- 
bles, for example, anon for anonymous, (4) ini- 
tials, as with titles or long names, for example, 
O A S for Organization of American States 
A word formed from the initials or from the 
elements of a compound term is called an acro- 
nym, and IS usually spelled without periods, 
such as NATO for North Atlantic Treaty Organi- 
zation An organization sometimes adopts a 
name the acronym of which indicates the na- 
ture of the organization For example, the acro- 
nym WAVES comes from Women's Appointed 
Voluntary Emergency Service, although the offi- 
cial name of the organization is Women's Re- 
serve of the United States Naval Reserve.

ABD-ER-RAHMAN 


A.B.C POWERS^ early-20th-century term for 
Argentina, Brazil, and Chile Beginning in 1899 
these nations, striving to maintain peace in 
South and Central America and to achieve com- 
mon action and policy on problems concerning 
all Latin American countries, concluded a series 
of treaties which provided for arbitration of dis- 
putes and mutual assistance against aggression 
The respective alliances were primarily directed 
against certain policies of the United States par- 
ticularly those implicit m the Monroe Doctrine 
(q v ) Shortly before the outbreak of World War 
I the alliances assumed the character of an en- 
tente cordiale Treaties providing for such an 
entente were drafted and signed in 1915, but 
were never ratified One of the most important 
collective accomplishments of the ABC Pow- 
ers was successful mediation in 1914 of a serious 
dispute between the U S and Mexico arising 
from the refusal of the U S to recognize Gen- 
eral Victoriano Huerta (q v ) as president of 
Mexico 

ABD-AL-AZIZ IV or ABDUL-AZIZ (1878- 
1943), Sultan of Morocco (1894-1908) Abd-al- 
Aziz succeeded his father Sultan Mulai Hassan 
on his death in 1894 He was friendly toward Eu- 
ropeans and took great interest in Western civi- 
lization His foreign sympathies offended his 
subjects, and in 1902 a formidable rebellion 
broke out The disorder enabled France to be- 
come predominant m Morocco German activity 
in Morocco subsequently caused intense fric- 
tion between France and Germany At the 
suggestion of the sultan, a conference of Euro- 
pean powers was held at Algeciras, Spam, m 
1906 According to the decisions of the confer- 
ence, France and Spam were commissioned to 
maintain order on the Moroccan coast The sul- 
tan was deposed by his brother Abd-al-Hafiz 
(1875?-1937) m 1908 See also Morocco His- 
tory 

ABD-EL-KRIM or ABDEL KRIM (1880?-1963), 
leader of the Riffians, an Arab tribe of Morocco 
In 1921 he led his tribe against a Spanish military 
post m Er Rif, Morocco, capturing it and massa- 
cring 16,000 soldiers By 1924 the Spanish were 
forced to retreat to their holdings along the 
coast of Morocco Meanwhile, France laid claim 
to territory m southern Er Rif The following year 
a French force under Marshal Henri Philippe Pe- 
tain (q v ) and a Spanish army began operations 
against the Riffians Hard fighting continued for 
a year, but finally the combined armies defeated 
the forces of Abd-el-Krim He was exiled to the 
French island of Reunion from 1926 to 1947, 
when he was granted permission to live m 
southern France He left the ship carrying him to

from the king of Egypt, became a resident of 
that country After 1948 he was a leader of the 
North African nationalist opposition to Euro- 
pean rule See also Berber 
ABDERA, city of ancient Thrace, near the 
mouth of the Nestos R , almost opposite the 
island of Thasos It was founded by colonists 
from the ancient Ionian city Clazomenae m the 
7th century bc Several noted Greeks, including 
the philosophers Democritus and Protagoras 
(qq v ), were born in Abdera Rums mark the 
site of the city 

ABD-ER-RAHMAN (d 732), Arab soldier and 
Emir of Spam (731-32) He became governor of 
southern France in 721. In 732, when the growth 
of Frankish power menaced the Muslim posi- 
tion in Spam, he led an army across the Pyr- 
enees mountains into the dominions of the 
Franks (q v ) His army met the Franks, led by 
Charles Martel (q v ), near Tours, France, later 
that year In the ensuing battle, the Muslims 
were defeated and Abd-er-Rahman was killed 
ABD-ER-RAHMAN, name of several Umay- 
yad rulers of Spam The most important of these 
rulers were the following 
Abd-er-Rahman I, m Arabic 'ABD-AL-RAH- 
MAN IBN-MU'AWiYAH (731-88), Emir of Spam 
(756^), grandson of Hisham, tenth Caliph of

curbed the power of the nobility and created a 
highly centralized government He subse- 
quently built a strong navy, wrested part of Mo- 
rocco from the Fatimid dynasty, inflicted several 
defeats on the Christian kingdoms of Le6n and

ABDICATION^ relinquishment of office by a 
ruler or sovereign In modern times sovereigns 
have abdicated for many different reasons 

Queen Christina of Sweden relinquished her 
crown in 1654 because she was weary of the 
cares of office III health caused the abdication 
of the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V in 1558 
and of Philip V of Spam in 1724 Louis Bona- 
parte, appointed (1806) king of Holland by the 
French emperor Napoleon I, abdicated m 1810 
m protest because his brother treated Holland 
merely as a province of France Charles Emman- 
uel of Sardinia was compelled by the French 
government to abdicate m 1802, his successor, 
Victor Emmanuel, abdicated m 1821 m the face 
of a popular uprising against his regime Foreign 
force compelled the abdications of the Polish 
kings Augustus (1704), Stanislas I Leszczyhski 
(1735), and Stanislas I! Augustus (1795) and of 
Charles IV of Spam (1808). Napoleon I of France 
also was forced to abdicate by allied foreign 
powers, both m 1814 and, after his return to 
power, m 1815 

Insurrections often have forced abdications, 
including those of Richard II of England (1399), 
Mary of Scotland (1567), Charles X of France 
(1830), Louis Philippe of France (1848), Ferdi- 
nand of Austria (1848), Louis of Bavaria (1848), 
Charles Albert of Sardinia (1849), Amadeus of 
Spam (1873), Prince Alexander of Bulgaria 
(1886), Milan of Serbia (1889), Manuel II of 
Portugal (1910), and Nicholas II of Russia (1917). 

The defeat of the Central Powers m World 
War I resulted (1918) in a number of abdica- 
tions, including those of William II of Germany, 
Charles I of Austria-Hungary, Louts III of Bavaria, 
Frederick Augustus 111 of Saxony, and William II 


of Wurttemberg Several abdications occurred 
also during the period between World War | 
and World War II King Constantine I of Greece 
was forced to abdicate twice by foreign and 
domestic political pressure m 1917, during 
World War I, and, after his recall, again in 1922 
as a consequence of the Greek defeat in the 
Turkish War King Prajadhipok of Siam abdi- 
cated m 1935 because of bad health King Ed- 
ward VIII (q.v) of Great Britain (later Duke of 
Windsor) abdicated m 1936 because the govern- 
ment opposed his marriage plans

ABDOMEN, lower of the two cavities into 
which the diaphragm divides the human body, 
or the region of the body containing this cavity 
It IS subdivided into two parts, the abdomen 
proper, and the pelvis, or basin The abdomen 


proper contains organs or digestion, such as the 
liver, pancreas, stomach, small intestine, and 
large intestine, and the spleen and kidneys The 
pelvis contains tne sigmoid tlexure, the rectum, 
the urinary bladder, and the internal organs of 
the reproductive system The superficial aspect 
of the abdomen is divided, tor descriptive pur- 
poses, into nine approximately equal areas 
From above downward, the three central areas 
are called the epigastric, umbilical, and hypo- 
gastric regions, respectivelv, these divisions are 
flanked by the right and left hypochondriac, 
lumbar, and inguinal regions In comparative 
anatomy, the abdomen is the posterior of the 
two or three parts into w'hich the body of an ar- 
thropod IS divided See Anatomy, see aiso sepa-

ABDUCTION, originally, in ancient law, the 
unlawful taking away of a free person, or of a 
slave belonging to another Thus, the buying of 
a free person w'as punishable by the criminal 
law of Rome under the name of plagium, this 
term is still used in Scotland for the theft of chil- 
dren, male or female, under the age of puberty 
In the United States abduction is the taking and 
carrying away of a child, a ward, or a wife by 
fraud, persuasion, or open violence Anyone 
who takes away any female under the age of 
eighteen years from her father, mother, guard- 
ian, or other person having the legal charge of 
her person, without her consent, for the pur- 
pose of prostitution, is guilty of a felony A child 
under the age of fourteen years is incapable of 
giving her consent In England abduction tech- 
nically means the taking away of a woman ei- 
ther against her own will, or (in the case of a 
woman under the age of twenty-one) against 
the will of her parents or guardians. See Kid-

ABDULLAH IBN-HUSEIN (1882-1951), King 
of Jordan (1946-51), and son of King Husein ibn- 
Ali (1856-1931), of Hejaz, born in Mecca During 
World War 1, with the support of the British, he 
led Arab revolts against the Turks in Arabia In 
1921 he became the nominal ruler of the British 
mandate of Transjordan, with the title of emir 
He obtained qualified independence for the 
emirate in 1928 In May, 1946, after the British 
mandate had ended, he proclaimed himself 
king of Transjordan The State changed its name 
to Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan in 1949 Mean- 
while, in 1945 he helped to establish the Arab 
League (qv), an association of Muslim states 
formed to prevent the establishment of a Jewish 
state in Palestine In May, 1948, immediately 
after the creation of the State of Israel (q v ), 
King Abdullah led the Arab invasion of the new 
state. The Jordanian army, a British-tramed or- 
ganization known as the Arab Legion, was the 
only Arab army which gained any significant 
amount of Israeli territory in the ensueing war 
In April, 1949, Abdullah's government com- 
pleted armistice negotiations with Israel, retain- 
ing control of Old Jerusalem, Bethlehem, He- 
bron, and other sectors of Palestine In the same 
year he proposed the formation of a Greater 
Syria, to consist of Jordan, Syria, and Iraq, his 
plan, however, was opposed by other members 
of the Arab League Abdullah further outraged 
the league when he formally annexed (1950) the 
Jordan-occupied portion of Palestine On July 
20, 1951, as he entered the Al Aksa mosque in 
Jerulsalem, Abdullah was assassinated by one of

ABEL, in the Old Testament book of Genesis 
the second son of Adam and Eve, and the 
brother of Cam (qq v ) Abel was a 'shepherd 
and his older brother Cam cultivated the land! 
Jealous that Abel's sacrifice of the firstlings (first 
offspring) of his flock was accepted by God, 
while his own offering of first fruits (initial har- 
vest) was not. Cam slew Abet (Gen 41-8) This 
fratricide is the mam theme of the story Also 
underlying the story is the conception of the 
semmomadic life as intrinsically nobler and 
more pleasing to God than the life of the 
farmer Even m later Hebrew thought Abel re- 
mained the type of the true worshiper, and his 
animal sacrifice was regarded as better than that 
of Cam (Heb 11 4) Abel was looked upon as 
the righteous man, the possessor of true faith, in 
contrast to Cam the wicked (Matt 23 35, Luke 
11 51, 1 John 3 12). 

ABEL, Sir Frederick Augustus (1827-1902), Eng- 
lish chemist, born in London, and educated at 
the Royal College of Chemistry He devoted 
himself chiefly to the science of explosives. He 
was consulting chemist to the British War De- 
partment from 1854 to 1888 
Abel introduced important improvements in 
the manufacture of guncotton and of blasting 
gelatin, and with the Scottish scientist Sir James 
Dewar (q v ) invented cordite, a smokeless pow- 
der 

ABEL, Niels Henrik (1802-29), Norwegian 
mathematician, born on Fmnoya Island, Roga- 
land Co After study at the University of Christi- 
ania (now Oslo), he spent two years in Parts and 
Berlin and m 1828 was made instructor at the 
university and military school m Christiania He 
was the first to demonstrate conclusively the 
impossibility of solving by the elementary proc- 
esses of algebra general equations of any degree 
higher than the fourth His chief contributions 
were made to the theory of functions, of which 
he was one of the founders An important class 
of transcendental functions are known as Abel- 
ian, from their discoverer (see Function) There 
are also Abelian equations, groups, and bodies 
The binomial theorem had been formulated by 
the English mathematician Sir Isaac Newton and

ABELARD 


the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler (qq v ), 
but Abel gave it a more comprehensive general- 
ization, including the cases of irrational and 
imaginary exponents (see Binomial). 

ABELARD, Peter (1079-1142), French scholas- 
tic philosopher and theologian, born near 
Nantes He left home to study at Loches with 
the French nominalist philosopher Roscellmus 
(d after 1120) and later in Pans with the French 
realist philosopher Guillaume de Champeaux 
{1070^-1121), see Nominalism, Realism Critical of 
his masters, Abelard began to teach at Melun, at 
Corbeil, and m 1108 at Pans He soon gained 
fame throughout Europe as a teacher and origi- 
nal thinker In 1117 he became tutor to Heloise 
(1101 ?-64), the niece of Fulbert, a canon of 
Notre-Dame in Pans 

Heloise and Abelard fell in love and she gave 
birth to a son whom they named Astrolabe 
At Abelard's insistence they were married se- 
cretly, since he had not yet received major or- 
ders Abelard persuaded Heloise to take holy 
vows at the Benedictine Abbey of Samt-Argen- 
teuil Her family, at first enraged by the relation- 
ship between Heloise and Abelard and later 
somewhat placated by their marriage, finally de- 
cided that Abelard had abandoned Heloise at 
the abbey and had him emasculated Abelard, 
too, retired to a religious retreat at the Abbey of 
Saint-Denis-en-France, in Pans 



Peter Abelard installing his wife Heloise as the abbess 
of the nunnery he founded at the Paraclete 


Abelard's first published work, a treatise on 
the Trinity (1121), was condemned and ordered 
burned by a Roman Catholic council that met at 
Soissons in the same year Forced b> criticism to 
leave St -Denis-en-France, Abelard founded a 
chapel and oratory, called the Paraclete, at No- 
gent-sur-Seine In 1125 he was elected abbot of 
the monastery at Samt-Gildas-de-Rhuis Heloise, 
who meanwhile had become prioress at Argen- 
teuil, was called to the Paraclete as abbess of 
the nunnery established there At St -Gildas 
Abelard wrote his autobiographical Histona Ca- 
lamitatum ("History of Misfortunes", 1132) At 
this time the famous exchange of letters with 
Heloise began, these letters have become clas- 
sics of romantic correspondence In 1140 Saint 
Bernard of Ciairvaux (q v ), the most eminent 
French ecclesiastic of the period, provoked a 
Roman Catholic council in session at Sens, and 
Pope Innocent II (d 1142), into condemning 
Abelard for his skeptical, rationalistic writings 
and teaching On his way to Rome to appeal the 
condemnation, Abelard accepted the hospitality 
of Peter the Venerable (1092?-1156), abbot of 
the Abbey of Cluny, remaining there for many 
months Abelard died at a Clunist priory near 
Chalon-sur-Saone His body was taken to the 
Paraclete; when Heloise died m 1164 she was 
buried beside him, in 1817 both bodies were 
moved to a single tomb in the cemetery of Pere 
Lachaise in Pans 

The romantic appeal of the life of Abelard 
often overshadows the importance of his 
thought. In the emphasis he placed on dialecti- 
cal discussion, Abelard followed the 9th-century 
philosopher and theologian Johannes Scotus 
Engena (q v ), and he foreshadowed the Italian 
Scholastic philosopher Saint Thomas Aquinas 
(q v ) Abelard's important dialectical thesis that 
truth must be attained by carefully weighing all 
sides of any issue is presented m Sic et Non 
("Thus and Otherwise", 1123?) He foreshad- 
owed also the later theological reliance on the 
works of the Greek philosopher Aristotle (q v ), 
rather than on those of Aristotle's teacher Plato 
(qv.) 

Abelard reacted strongly against the theories 
of extreme realism, denying that universals have 
an independent existence outside the mind. Ac- 
cording to Abelard, a universal is a functional 
word expressing the combined image of that

ABERRATION OF LIGHT, in astronomy, the 
alteration in the apparent position of a star, aris- 


ing from motion of the observer transverse to 
the direction of the beam of light observed 
Such motion is the resultant ot such velocities 
as the speed of the diurnal rotation of the earth, 
Its orbital speed in revolving around the sun, 
and the speed of the solar system through 
space Although the resultant velocity ot the ob- 
server IS small compared with the velocity of 
light. It IS enough to cause an apparent displace- 
ment of the rays of light from a celestial object, 
just as a drop of ram, failing vertically, leaves a 
diagonal trace on the window of a moving car 
This displacement reaches a maximum of 20 47 
sec of an arc, called the constant of aberration 
The discovery of the aberration ot light, by the 
British astronomer James Bradley (q v ) in 1727, 
was one of the most important discoveries m 
physical science, the discovery initiated a series 
of investigations that led to the formulation ot 
the theory of relativity (q v )

ABOLITIONISTS, m American historyu term 
generally applied, from about 1835 until the 
close of the American Civil War in 1865, to ex- 
treme opponents of slavery (q v ) Abolitionists 
differed trom those of moderate antislavery 
feelings m that they called for an immediate 
end to slavery The most exlfeme abolitionists 
denied the validity of any laws which recog- 
nized slavery as an institution, thus, they re- 
fused to obey the Fugitive Slave Laws (q v ) or 
accept the sections of the Constitution of the 
United States on which they were based In 
practice, abolitionists systematically violated the 
Fugitive Slave Laws by organizing and operating 
the Underground Railroad (q v ), by which runa- 
way slaves were concealed and transported to 
Canada The activities and propaganda of the 
abolitionists, although discredited m conserva- 
tive Northern quarters and violently opposed m 
the South, made slavery a national issue 
Most historians date the beginning of the ab- 
olitionist movement in 1831, when the Ameri- 
can abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison (q v.) 
founded the Liberator in Boston, Mass This 
newspaper soon became the official organ of 
American abolitionism In 1833 the American 
Anti-Slavery Society (q v ) was organized m Phil- 
adelphia, Pa, under Garrison's leadership, this 
society was the most militant of all the organiza- 
tions in the fight against slavery In 1839 the so- 
ciety split into two mam groups, the radicals 
and the so-called gradualists. The spilt resulted 
from a bitter disagreement concerning policy 
and tactics The radical leaders, who included, 
besides Garrison, Wendell Phillips, Lucretia 
Mott, and John Brown (qq v.), refused to join a 
party necessarily committed to gradual and legal 
emancipation of the slaves; these leaders re- 
tained control of the Liberator and the Ameri- 
can Anti-Slavery Society. The gradualists, who 
included James Gillespie Birney (q v ), Arthur 
Tappan (1786-1865) and his brother Lewis Tap- 
pan (1788-1873), and Theodore Dwight Weld 
(1803-95), believed that emancipation could be 
achieved legally, by means of pressures exerted 
through religious and political organizations In 
1840 the Tappans founded the American and 
Foreign Anti-Slavery Society One year earlier, a 
group led by Birney founded the first antislavery 
political party, the Liberty Party (qv), in the 
United States Birney was the unsuccessful Pres- 
idential candidate (1840 and 1844} of the Liberty 
Party, the adherents of which helped to found 
the Free-Soil Party (q v ) in 1848 and the Repub-

ABORIGINES, earliest-known inhabitants of a 
country The term is applied generally to the 
original or native inhabitants of a country, as 
opposed to an intrusive conquering race, from 
another area, or to colonists and their descend- 
ants Most civilized nations have instituted mea- 
sures for the welfare of the aborigines within 
their territories Such measures include those of 
the United States and Canada concerning Indi- 
ans and Eskimos and those of Australia concern- 
ing Its aboriginal groups 

All aboriginal peoples have been affected by 
contact with contemporary civilization, in some 
cases the introduction of disease, warfare, alco- 
hol, and drugs has demoralized and decimated 
peoples Some become almost wholly assimi- 
lated, as, for example, the Ainus (see Ainu) of 
northern Japan. At present, among the Ainus, 
only the old and those in isolated communities 
retain their traditions, the young are adjusting to 
the Japanese culture The greatest degree of ra- 
cial admixture has occurred among the native 
Polynesians (q v ) of Hawaii The Indian popula- 
tion of the US has extensively intermarried 
with whites, those Indians living on reservations 
retain some folkways In Central and South 
America and m the Caribbean region many 
tribes have become extinct, in most cases after 
Spanish or Portuguese conquest Among aborig- 
ines who have kept strong elements of original 
identity are the Eskimos (see Eskimo), Maoris, 
Dayaks (qqv), and Australian aborigines (see 
Australia* The People- Aborigines) Tribes in 
such comparatively inaccessible areas as the 
Amazon R basin of South America still live 
largely according to their primitive cultures

ABORTION, termination of pregnancy before 
the fetus is capable of independent life When 
the expulsion from the womb occurs after the 
fetus becomes viable (capable of independent 
life), usually at the end of six months of preg- 
nancy, It is technically a premature birth. 

Abortion may be spontaneous or induced. Ex- 


pelled fetuses weighing less than 16 oz or of 
less than twenty weeks' gestation usually are 
considered abortions It is estimated that some 
25 percent of all human pregnancies terminate 
spontaneously in abortion, with three out ot 
four abortions occurring during the first three 
months of pregnancy Some women apparently 
have a tendency to abort, and recurrent abor- 
tion decreases the probability of subsequent 
successful childbirth 

The causes of spontaneous abortions, or mis- 
carriages, are not clearly established Abnormal 
development of the embryo or placental tissue, 
or both, is found in about half of the cases, 
these abnormalities may be due to inherent 
faults in the germ cells or may be secondary to 
faulty implantation of the developing ovum or 
to other factors in the maternal environment 
Severe vitamin deficiencies have been shown to 
play a role in abortions in experimental animals 
Hormone deficiencies also have been found in 
women who are subject to recurrent abortions 
Spontaneous abortions may be caused also by 
such maternal abnormalities as acute infectious

ABORTION 


diseases^ systemic diseases such as nephritis and 
diabetes, severe trauma, and excessive physical 
activity Uterine malformations, including tu- 
mors, are responsible in some instances, and ex- 
treme anxiety and other psychic disturbances 
may be contributory factors in the premature 
expulsion of the fetus 

The commonest symptom of threatened abor- 
tion is vaginal bleeding, with or without inter- 
mittent pain However, about one fourth of all 
pregnant women bleed at some time during ear- 
ly pregnancy, and up to 75 percent of these 
cases carry the fetus for the full term Treatment 
for threatened abortion usually consists of bed 
rest Almost continuous bed rest throughout 
pregnancy is required in some cases of repeated 
abortion, and vitamin and hormone therapy also 
may be given In addition, surgical correction of 
uterine abnormalities may be indicated in cer- 
tain cases of repeated abortion 

Spontaneous abortion may result in expulsion 
of all or part of the contents of the uterus or the 
embryo may die and be retained in the uterus 
for weeks or months in a so-called missed abor- 
tion. Most physicians advocate the surgical re- 
moval of any residual embryonic or placental 
tissue in order to avoid possible irritation or in- 
fection of the uterine lining 
Induced Abortion. Induced abortion is the 
deliberate termination of pregnancy by removal 
of the fetus from the womb. The practice was 
widespread as a form of birth control m ancient 
civilizations and, although restricted or forbid- 
den by most world religions, it was not an of- 
fense in secular law until the 19th century In 
1803 the English Parliament prohibited induced 
abortion in order to protect women from a pro- 
cedure that was at the time dangerous to their 
lives (protection of the fetus was not then a leg- 
islative concern). State legislatures in the United 
States gradually enacted similar statutes, gener- 
ally stipulating a threat to the woman's life as 
the sole ("therapeutic") exception to the prohi- 
bition of abortion. Occasionally the exception 
was enlarged to include danger to her health as 
well. In 1869 the Catholic Church prohibited the 
practice with no exceptions; other major reli- 
gions generally took less consistent positions. 

Legislative action m the 20th century has been 
aimed at permitting the termination of unwant- 
ed pregnancies for medical, social, or private 
reasons Abortions at the woman's request were 
first allowed by the Soviet Union in 1920, fol- 
lowed by Japan and several East European na- 
tions after World War II. In the late 1%0's liber- 
alized abortion regulations became widespread 
The impetus for the change was threefold: (1) 

108 


infanticide and the high maternal death rate as- 
sociated with illegal abortions, (2) a rapidly ex- 
panding world population, (3) the growing 
women's rights movements By 1979, countries 
where abortions were prohibited or permitted 
only to save a woman's life contained 21 per- 
cent of the world's population Countries with 
moderately restrictive laws— abortions permit- 
ted to protect a woman's health, to end preg- 
nancies resulting from rape or incest, to avoid 
genetic or congenital defects, or m response to 
social problems such as unmarried status or in- 
adequate income— contained 39 percent of the 
world's population Abortions at the woman's 
request, usually with limits based on physical 
conditions such as duration of pregnancy, were 
allowed in countries with 37 percent of the 
world's population (The remaining 3 percent 
was unreported.) 

In the US, legislation followed the world 
trend Fourteen States adopted the moderately 
restrictive type of abortion law between 1%7 
and 1972 Four States (Alaska, Hawaii, New York, 
and Washington) legislated abortion on request 
with few restrictions. In 1973 the US Supreme 
Court declared unconstitutional all State statutes 
but the least restrictive type Noting that in- 
duced early abortions had become safer than 
childbirth and holding that the word "person" 
in the Constitution "does not include the un- 
born", the Court defined, within each of the 
three stages of pregnancy, the reciprocal limits 
of State power and individual freedom 

"(a) During the first trimester, the abortion 
decision and its effectuation must be left to the 
medical judgment of the pregnant woman's at- 
tending physician (b) After the first trimester, 
the State, in promoting its interest m the health 
of the mother, may, if it chooses, regulate the 
abortion procedure m ways that are reasonably 
related to maternal health (c) For the stage sub- 
sequent to viability, the State, in promoting its 
interest in the potentiality of human life may, if 
It chooses, regulate and even proscribe abor- 
tion, except where it is necessary, in appropriate 
medical judgment, for the preservation of the 
life or health of the mother". 

Opponents of the 1973 Supreme Court ruling, 
arguing for the rights of the unborn, sought to 
restrict its application and began a campaign for 
a constitutional amendment to prohibit or se- 
verely restrict abortion. 

In 1976 the Supreme Court struck down State 
laws requiring parental consent for a minor's 
abortion and the husband's consent for a mar- 
ried woman's abortion In 1977 the Court ruled 
that the Constitution does not require a State to

ABRABANEL or ABARBANEL or ABRAVANEL, 
name of a distinguished medieval Jewish family 
of southern Europe Among the most important 
members were the following 
Isaac Abrabanel (1437-1508), statesman, phi- 
losopher, and theologian, born in Lisbon, Portu- 
gal He was a favorite of Alfonso V (q v ), king of 
Portugal, who made him his treasurer After the 
king died in 1481, Abrabanel was accused of 
conspiracy and fled to Castile For eight years 
(1484-92) he served as a minister under King 
Ferdinand V and Queen Isabella I When the 
Jews were banished from Spain in 1492 he 
moved on, taking up residence in Naples In 
1503 he settled in Venice, where he was em- 
ployed in diplomatic service His theological 
writings include Sources of Salvation (14%), 
Salvation of His Anointed (1497), and Pro- 
claiming Salvation (1498) 

Judah Leon Abrabanel^ better known as LEO 
HEBRAEUS (d 1535), physician and writer, son 
of Isaac Abrabanel, born in Lisbon He was med- 
ical attendant at the court of the Spanish mili- 
tary commander Hernandez Gonzalo de Cor- 
doba (q V ) His most important work, Dialogues 
of Love, was published m Italian in 1535 
ABRAHAM or ABRAM (2nd millennium BC), 
traditional progenitor of the Hebrew people, ac- 
cording to the Old Testament (see Hebrews) and 
regarded by Muslims, who call him Ibraham, as 
an ancestor (see Ishmael). Originally called 
Abram, he was the son of Terah (Gen 11 26), a 
descendant of Shem (q v ), and was born in the 
city of Ur (q v,) of the Chaldees, where he mar- 
ried his half sister Sarai, or Sarah (Gen 11 29) 
They left Ur with his nephew Lot (q v ) and Lot's 
family under a divine inspiration (Gen 15 7) 
and went to Haran (Gen 11.31) Receiving a 
promise that God would make him a "great na- 
tion", Abram moved on to Canaan (Gen 121- 
2), where he lived as a nomad Famine led him 
to Egypt, but he was driven out for misrep- 
resenting Sarai as his sister (Gen 12*10-20) 
Again m Canaan, after quarrels beset Abram and 
Lot and their herdsmen, they separated. Lot re- 
maining near Sodom and Abram continuing his

century English book of Psalms) Pterpont Morgan Library 


nomadic life with renewed promises from God 
(Gen 1314-18). He later rescued Lot from the 
captivity of King Chedorlaomer of Elam, and 
was blessed by King Melchizedek of Salem 
(Gen 14 8-16, 18-19) Then God, according to 
Gen 15, promised Abram a son by his wife 
Sarai, repeated his earlier promises, and con- 
firmed these by a covenant (q.v.) 

When this covenant was later renewed, the 
rite of circumcision (q.v ) was established, 
Abram's name became Abraham, and Sarai's be- 
came Sarah (Gen 17) God subsequently re- 
peated his promise of a male son by Sarah by 
means of visiting angels (Gen 181-15). 

When God informed Abraham that He in- 
tended to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah (q v ) 
because of the wickedness of their inhabitants, 
Abraham pleaded with Him to spare the cities 
Eventually it was agreed that God would spare 
the cities if He could find only ten righteous 
men (Gen 18 17-32) The ten men could not be 
found, and God destroyed both cities 

Ishmael, first son of Abraham, whose mother 
was Hagar (q v ), an Egyptian slave, was born 
when Abraham was eighty-seven years old 
(Gen 1616) Isaac (qv), born to Abraham by 
Sarah in his hundredth year, was the first of his 
legitimate descendants (Gen. 21*1-5) God de- 
manded that Abraham sacrifice Isaac as a test of 
faith, but because of Abraham's unquestioning 
compliance, God permitted him to spare Isaac

and rewarded Abraham with a formal renewal 
of his promises (Gen. 22 1--18) After Sarah died, 
Abraham married Keturah and had six sons by 
her He died at the age of 175, and was buried 
beside Sarah in the Cave of Machpelah, in what 
IS now Hebron, Jordan (Gen 25 7-10) 

Christians and Muslims, as well as the jews, 
accept Abraham as an epitome of the man of 
unswerving faith The latter is reflected in such 
New Testament passages as Rom 4 11, Gal 3 7, 
Jas 2 21-23, and Heb 11 8-10

DAVID (1110?-80?), Jewish historian and philos-

first Jewish philosophers to introduce the Aris- 
totelian system of knowledge to Judaism (see 
Aristotle Philosophy) His philosophical work, 
written in Arabic, Al-'akidah al-Rafiyah, was pre- 
served m a Hebrew translation as Emanah

ABRAHAM^S BOSOM, Christian name for the 
abode of the blessed (Luke 1619-31) It is also 
found m Jewish literature, but commentators 
disagree on whether it means heaven (qv) or 
simply the covenant of circumcisions (q v ) The 
commonly accepted explanation of the term is 
that It reflects the custom current m Biblical 
times and lands for guests to recline at table so 
that the head of each leaned toward the breast 
of his neighbor. The honored guest, therefore, 
was said to he in the bosom of his host In 
Byzantine art (q v ), Abraham takes the souls of

Its surface Abrasives are usuaily very hard sub- 
stances Some are used m the form of fine pow- 
ders, others break in such a way as to form 
sharp cutting edges and are used m larger 
pieces Objects are ground to shape with a 
coarse abrasive, causing comparatively wide 
scratches on the surface of the object Polishing 
IS done with a fine abrasive, to produce narrow 
scratches In each case the object must be softer 
than the abrasive Rouge and similar polishing 
agents are sometimes called abrasives, although 
they may be softer than the material that they 
are used to polish 

Most natural abrasives are minerals corun- 
dum, diamond, emery, garnet, pumice, quartz, 
and sand, various types of diatomaceous earth 
(q V ) have also been used Among the older 
synthetic abrasives are rouge, crushed steel, and 
powdered glass Since 1891 several synthetic 
abrasives (carbides, borides, nitrides) have been 
available These synthetic abrasives are almost 
as hard as diamonds and can be substituted for 
diamonds in every operation except the grind- 
ing of the diamond itself Among these are syn- 
thetic corundum, tungsten carbide, boron car- 
bide, and silicon carbide, widely known as 
carborundum

ABRONIA, genus of low or trailing plants of 
the four-o'clock family, native to the western 
United States Species of Abronia are popular 
garden plants, and are commonly named sand 
verbenas They are grown as annuals m cool cli- 
mates, m mild climates they are self-seeding 
The flowers, white, yellow, or pink, depending 
on the species, bloom through most of the sum- 
mer They have a strong, pleasant odor 
ABRUS, genus of tropical, climbing plants of 
the Pea family The species have pinnate leaves, 
white to reddish-purple flowers, and black- 
spotted, red seeds in fiat pods They are culti- 
vated in the southern part of the United States 
for garden screens and other ornamental ef- 
fects The seeds of the Indian licorice, A preca- 
torius, are used in making the beads of Buddhist 
rosaries, this use gives rise to its common names 
of prayer beads and rosary pea 
ABRUZZI, region of Italy, m the south-central 
portion of the country, on the Adriatic Sea, 
comprised of four provinces named after their 
chief towns, L'Aquila, Chieti, Pescara, and Ter- 
amo Topographically, the region is comprised 
of two distinct areas The w portion, almost 
contiguous with the province of L'Aquila, con- 
sists of three ranges of the Apennines, including 
their valleys and basins Extending in a nw-se 
direction, the highest range culminates at 9650 


ft above sea level in Monte Corno, a peak of 
the Gran Sasso ditaha section In the E, sand 
and clay hills slope gradually downward to a 
broad coastal plain on the Adriatic Sea encom- 
passing the provinces of Chieti, Pescara, and 
Teramo The 100-mi coastline lacks good natu- 
ral harbors The Pescara R , an important source 
of hydroelectric power, and the Sangro, Trigno, 
and Biferno rivers irrigate the lower valleys, all 
dram into the Adriatic Sea Sheep and cattle 
grazing and the cultivation of potatoes and 
wheat in the highlands, of corn, olives, grapes, 
and citrus fruits m the coastal valleys, and of 
sugar beets m the drained basin of Lake Fucino

In the 4th century' bc the inhabitants of the 
region were conquered by the Romans From 
the 6th to the 11th century ad the area was 
under the control of the Lombards, and in the 
12th and 13th centuries it was part of the Nor- 
man kingdom of Sicily Governed as part of the 
kingdom of Naples from about 1240 to 1861, it 
was then incorporated into the unified kingdom 
of Italy The region of Abruzzi e Molise became 
the two separate regions of Abruzzi and Molise

ABSALON or AXEL (1128-1201), Danish sol- 
dier, statesman, and ecclesiastic, born in Den- 
mark and educated m Pans He was bishop of 
Roskilde, Denmark, from 1158 to 1178 and arch- 
bishop of Lund, Sweden, and in that capacity, 
primate of Scandinavia, from 1178 until his 
death Absalon served as minister and general 
during the reigns of the Danish kings Waldemar 
I (1131--82) and Canute VI (1163-1202) His most 
notable military exploits were the defeat of a 
fleet of Wendish pirates (see Wends) from Pom- 
erania and Rugen in a Baltic Sea naval battle 
(1168) and the destruction of a Pomeranian 
force besieging the Danish-held Wendish city 
of Rugen (1184) At Absalon's suggestion the 
Danish historian Saxo Grammaticus (qv), who 
was also Absalon's secretary, compiled the fa- 
mous chronicle of early Danish history known 
as the History of the Danes (about 1186) 
ABSCESS^ collection of pus, a thick yellowish 
fluid, in infected tissues of the body Abscesses 
are caused by bacterial organisms and may form 
in any internal or surface part of the body, see 
Bacteria, Infection Common sites of abscesses 
are the skin, the gums, and the abdominal or- 
gans The area of the abscess becomes inflamed, 
that IS, red and swollen, sensations of pain, 
caused by the pus pressing on nerve endings, 
and localized heat are common If the inflamed 
tissue wall encompassing the infected cavity 
thins out sufficiently, the abscess may sponta- 


neously rupture, causing the pus to dram, or es- 
cape Medical treatment may involve the use of 
antibiotics and surgical incision See Antibiotic, 
Carbuncle, in medicine 

ABSENTEE BALLOT^ instrument on which a 
qualified voter indicates his voting choice by 
mail if he cannot be present at the polls on elec- 
tion day Such a person, upon application, re- 
ceives his ballot from a designated county offi- 
cial, and returns it before a specified time Most 
States in the United States provide for absentee 
balloting See Ballot 

ABSINTHE^ liquor flavored with pounded 
leaves and flowering tops of certain species of 
plants belonging to the genus Artemisia, chiefly 
wormwood, together with angelica root, sweet- 
flag root, star anise, and other aromatics (see Es- 
sential Oil) The aromatics are macerated for 
about eight days in alcohol and then distilled, 
the result being green-colored liquor Absinthe 
IS prohibited in the United States, France, and 
Canada because habitual use causes mental and 
physical debility 

ABSOLUTE, term used to denote whatever is 
in no way dependent or limited by anything 
else Thus, in ethics an absolute value is one that 
IS good in Itself rather than useful for obtaining 
something else, and an absolute principle is one 
that permits of no exceptions In political theory 
an absolute right is a right that society cannot 
take away from an individual 

In theology and metaphysics (qq*v ) the term 
"the Absolute" usually refers to God. According 
to the Dutch philosopher Baruch Spinoza (q v), 
God IS absolute, that is, unlimited, because by 
His very concept, nothing can limit God All 
other existing things exist through this absolute

ABSOLUTION 


substance The German philosopher Immanuel 
Kant (qv) defined the Absolute as an all-en- 
compassing totality and argued that scientific 
knowledge of such a being is impossible This 
position was adopted also by the British philos- 
ophers Herbert Spencer (q v ) and Sir William 
Hamilton (1788-1856) The Absolute figures also 
as the central concept in the philosophies of the 
19th-century German idealists, see Idealism In 
particular, the German philosopher Georg Wil- 
helm Friedrich Hegel (q v ) regarded the Abso- 
lute as a spiritual process that realizes itself 
through rationality alone, because only through 
the use of logic (qv) could reality be recog- 
nized He maintained, as did the British idealist 
philosophers Bernard Bosanquet (1848-1923), 
Thomas Hill Green (1836-82), and Francis Her- 
bert Bradley (1846-1924), that all knowledge is 
indirectly and incompletely knowledge of the 
Absolute The American idealist philosopher 
Josiah Royce (q v ), identified the Absolute with 
a so-called cosmic community, his system of 
philosophy came to be known as absolute 
idealism RA 

ABSOLUTE TEMPERATURE. See Heat Tem- 
perature Scales 

ABSOLUTE ZERO, lowest temperature theo- 
retically possible, characterized by complete ab- 
sence of heat at approximately —27316° C 
(-459 69° F ), or zero degree on the Kelvin 
scale, see Heat Temperature Scales, Tempera- 
ture The concept of absolute zero temperature 
was first deduced from experiments with gases, 
when a fixed volume of gas is cooled, its pres- 
sure decreases with its temperature Although 
this experiment cannot be conducted below the 
liquefaction point of the gas, a plot of the ex- 
perimental values of pressure versus tempera- 
ture can be extrapolated to zero pressure The 
temperature at which the pressure would be 
zero IS the absolute zero temperature This ex- 
perimental concept of a gas-thermometer tem- 
perature scale and of absolute zero was subse- 
quently shown to be consistent with the 
theoretical definitions of absolute zero See 
Kelvin, 1st Baron, William Thomson 
Absolute zero cannot be reached experimen- 
tally, although It can be approached very 
closely. Special procedures are needed to reach 
very low or cryogenic temperatures, see Cryo- 
genics Liquid helium (q v ), which has a normal 
boiling point of 4 3° K ( — 268 9° C ) can be pro- 
duced by cryostats based on a design by the 
American mechanical engineer Samuel Cornette 
Collins (1898- ) If the helium is then evapo- 

rated at reduced pressures, temperatures as low 
as 0.7° K can be obtained Temperatures lower 


than these require the adiabatic demagnetiza- 
tion of paramagnetic substances, such as 
chrome alum, while they are being surrounded 
with a liquid helium bath, see Thermodynamics 
The method, which was first developed by the 
Canadian-Amencan chemist William Francis 
Giauque (q v ) in 1937, utilizes a magnetic field 
which initially aligns the ionic magnets or the 
material If the magnetic field is removed, the 
magnets again assume their random orientation, 
reducing the thermal energy of the material and 
thus Its temperature Temperatures as low as 
0 002° K have been reached with the demagne- 
tization of paramagnetic salts, and the demag- 
netization of atomic nuclei has yielded temper- 
atures as low as 0 00001 ° K 
Temperature measurements at values close to 
absolute zero also present special problems Gas 
thermometers can only be used up to the lique- 
faction point of helium At lower temperatures, 
electric and magnetic measurements must be 
used to determine the effective temperature 
The concept of absolute zero temperature is 
also important m theoretical considerations Ac- 
cording to the third law of thermodynamics, the 
entropy of a pure crystal is zero at absolute zero 
temperature; this is of considerable importance 
in analyzing chemical reactions and in quantum 
physics, see Quantum Mechanics, Quantum 
Theory, Reactions, Chemical F La 

ABSOLUTION, term in Christian theology, 
most often used to refer to sacramental absolu- 
tion, the judicial act in the sacrament of Pen- 
ance (q v), by which the priest, as the minister 
of God, grants to the confessing penitent for- 
giveness of his sms In the Roman Catholic and 
Eastern Orthodox churches, under ordinary cir- 
cumstances, sacramental absolution is consid- 
ered essential To be effective, however, absolu- 
tion supposes a true contrition for sin and a firm 
purpose of amendment on the part of the peni- 
tent. Absolution IS optional in the Anglican 
Church, which holds that this ts only one means 
to obtain forgiveness of sms Most Protestant 
denominations do not hold penance as a sacra- 
ment, and therefore do not acknowledge the 
necessity for sacramental absolution Most de- 
nominations recognize a broader interpretation 
of absolution, that is, the remission of the sms 
of a repentant sinner They believe this remis- 
sion IS achieved, not by the mediating judicial 
act of a minister or priest, but by direct ac- 
knowledgment by the penitent of his transgres- 
sions to God and humble entreaty for His for- 
giveness Absolution as a term seems to be 
confined to Christian theology However, the 
concept of penitently beseeching a deity's for- 


113 



ABSOLUTISM 


giveness for individual offenses is common to 
almost a!! religions 

In the Roman Catholic Church, absolution 
can also mean release from ecclesiastical cen- 
sure (penalty imposed on one who commits any 
of certain extremely serious sms specifically 
condemned as crimes m canon law) or the rite 
immediately following a funeral Mass in which 
the mercy of God is implored for the soul of the 
dead V F 

ABSOLUTISM. See Political Science 
ABSORPTION, in chemistry, the taking up of 
one substance by another For example, a gas 
such as oxygen may be absorbed, or dissolved, 
in the blood The oxygen molecules ultimately 
become attached to hemoglobin molecules and 
the oxygen then loses all its distinctive charac- 
teristics 

In physics, absorption denotes the taking up 
of energy, such as light, heat, or other radiant 
energy, by an object The absorbed radiation is 
converted into heat, the radiation that is re- 
flected has changed characteristics For exam- 
ple, sunlight striking an object will usually have 
some of Its wavelengths absorbed and other 
wavelengths reflected If the object looks white. 
It IS because all, or nearly all, of the radiation is 
reflected If the object appears to have any color 
other than white, however, it shows that all the 
visible radiation has been absorbed except for 
those wavelengths that give rise to a color sen- 
sation when they strike the eye (see Color, Vi- 
sion) Objects that absorb all the radiation strik- 
ing them are known as black bodies 

Adsorption, which is often confused with ab- 
sorption, refers to the adhering of gases to the 
interior surfaces of porous solids, as activated 
carbon adsorbs certain gases Adsorption is a 
surface phenomenon, absorption is an inter- 
mingling or interpenetration of two substances 
ABSTRACT AND NONOBjECTIVE ART, art 
that employs forms or images having no direct 
reference to external or perceived reality The 
terms abstract a?!d nonobjective refer especially 
to art of the 20th century. In France these terms 
are used more or less synonymously In the 
United States, however, the term nonobjective 
always refers to art that has no recognizable nat- 
uralistic imagery, whereas the term abstract 
sometimes is applied also to works in which the 
images have been abstracted, or basically de- 
rived, from such recognizable sources as the 
human figure, the landscape, or still-life objects, 
but have been greatly altered 
Early Tendencies. Purely nonobjective art de- 
veloped m Europe during the first decades of 
the 20th century, but the tendency to abstract 


from perceived objects has been present m the 
art of all countries throughout history In the 
Orient, for example, artists normally abstracted 
when they painted landscapes and flowers, they 
sought to express the principle of growth when 
painting a flower or the weight of a mountain 
when painting a landscape, rather than to repro- 
duce a likeness In the West, the Renaissance 
(qv) interest m science, and particularly m the 
newly perfected techniques of perspective 
painting, prompted artists to try to render a 
faithful replica of what they saw 

Realism (q v ) in one form or another domi- 
nated Western art until well into the 19th cen- 
tury, when artists began to consider the prob- 
lems of expressive rather than descriptive 
painting The invention of photography, the tre- 
mendous discoveries of science concerning the 
nature of the universe, and the highly abstract 
trend of philosophy during the period ail fa- 
vored the rise of abstract art Certain artists con- 
cluded that the mam purpose of art is to repre- 
sent the essential qualities of a subject by 
means of abstract forms and symbols rather than 
to render its external appearance realistically 
The French painter Paul Cezanne (q v ) and vari- 
ous other artists deliberately sought to pene- 
trate surface appearances and even to sacrifice 
surface beauty in order to reach essential forms 
Another group of artists also turned away from 
imitative realism, but in the direction of decora- 
tive composition The theory of the French 
painter Paul Gauguin (q v ), expressed by his 
compatriot, the painter Maurice Denis (qv), 
was that "a picture — before being a battle 
horse, a nude woman, or some anecdote — is es- 
sentially a plane surface covered with colors as- 
sembled in a certain order"' 

This new concept of a picture as something 
inherently valid apart from its objective content 
was developed by the cubists (see Cubism), 
notably the Spanish painter and sculptor Pablo 
Picasso (q v ), who in his early period analyti- 
cally rendered bottles, guitars, or tables as flat 
shapes organized in rhythms he himself created 
The cubists thought of a pamtmg as an inde- 
pendent entity, but they used concrete, recog- 
nizable forms as their basic elements in building 
that entity The Fauvists (see Fauvism), working 
during the same period, also clung to the exter- 
nal appearance of objects but, through non- 
naturalistic color, tried to express more pro- 
found emotion 

Kandinsky and Mondriaan. The complete 
liberation of painting and sculpture from exter- 
nal reference was accomplished by other artists 
Of these the most influential were the Russian

ABSTRACT AND NONOBJECTIVE ART 


painter Vasily Kandinsky and the Dutch painter 
Pieter Cornells Mondriaan (qq v ) The divergent 
theories of these two men respectively express 
the essence of the two major branches in ab- 
stract art the organic art of freely invented 
forms moving in imaginary spaces and the struc- 
tural art of defined shape (often geometric) and 
color 

In 1910 Kandinsky arrived at a conception of 
completely abstract art, which he defined m his 
book Concerning the Spiritual in Art (1912) 
Kandinsky claimed for the visual arts the same 
freedom found in music He argued that form 
and color may be used to achieve a psychologi- 
cal effect similar to that of music, which "'vi- 
brates in the human soul" Abstract art "creates 
alongside the real world a new world which has 
nothing to do externa //y with reality It is subor- 
dinate internally to cosmic laws" 

Mondriaan made his departure from tradition 
just before World War I Analyzing the structure 
of an object against a horizon, he found that the 
principles of the vertical and horizontal were 
stronger when abstracted from their representa- 
tional function By 1917 he had reduced the ele- 
ments in his painting to the two dominating 
rhythms, vertical and horizontal, that produce 
tension by their intersection A founder in that 
year of de StijI, a group of Dutch artists, which 
fathered all later geometric abstraction, Mon- 
driaan wrote m the de StijI magazine that the 
"plastic means" of all painting, past and present, 
are only line and color Only through the totally 
nonobjective means of primary color and 
straight line, he felt, can modern man express 
universality, the unity of the spirit, and the bal- 
anced relationships of the cosmos In speaking 
of new plastic means, Mondriaan gave a name 
to what IS known as the neoplastic school 
Other Experimenters. Although Mondriaan 
and Kandinsky have emerged as towering fig- 
ures in the early history of nonobjective art, 
other men and movements contributed to the 
expression of the feeling of their time In Russia 
about 1909, Kazimir Sevennovich Malevich 
(1878-1935) gave form to the movement toward 
ultimate simplicity when he invented the term 
Suprematism He reduced art to a presentation 
of the most elementary forms, the circle and the 
square In Italy, also about 1909, the futurists 
(see Futurism) proclaimed m their manifestoes 
an era of freedom m art, demanding that the art- 
ist "despise utterly every form of imitation" and 
devote himself to the expression of the "univer- 
sal dynamism" of modern life In Germany, the 
Hungarian painter and designer Laszio Moholy- 
Nagy, the Swiss painter Paul Klee, the German- 


Amencan architect Walter Adolf Gropius 
(qq V ), Kandmskv, and others created the Bau- 
haus (q V ), an institute v\h!ch functioned from 
1919 to 1933, fostering experiments m abstract 
art in painting ana sculpture as well as m archi- 
tecture and applied arts 

The flowering of "isms" in the first half of the 
20th century reflected the new relationships to 
the universe that were being established in both 
the natural and physical sciences, as well as an 
increasingly marked interest m psychology The 
theory of the unconscious developed by the 
Austrian physician and psychoanalyst Sigmund 
Freud (q.v ) and the complementary theories of 
the Swiss psychoanalyst Carl Gustav Jung (q v ) 
were influential m such artistic experiments as 
those undertaken by the surrealists (see Surreal- 
ism) in "automatism" Direct expression of the 
intimate activities of the psyche was sought by 
such artists as the Spanish painter Joan Miro 
(qv) and the French painter-sculptor Jean Arp 
(q.v ), both of whom deployed abstract forms to 
reflect a state of mind rather than render an 
objective impression 

Styles After World War IL The dominant 
mode emerging after World War 1 1 had its roots 
in the free emotional expression proposed by 
Kandinsky and was nourished by surrealist 
preoccupations In Europe the expressionist vi- 
sion was epitomized by the German painter 
Wols (real name Wolfgang Schulze, 1913-51) 
whose small, cosmic compositions were, in 
spirit, somewhat related to the works of the 
American painter Mark Tobey (1890-1976) 
Other Europeans, generally grouped under the 
rubric "informalists" (Art Informel), included 
Pierre Soulages (1919- ), Jean Dubuffet (q v ), 
and Nicholas de Stael (1914-55), who Sought to 
displace the logical structures of both the cub- 
ists and the nonobjective structuralists in order 
to expose and explore the inner world of the 
mind as well as the infinite variety of sense 
experience, in the U S a comparable rejection 
of the cubist mode gained momentum during 
World War !i when such artists as Hans Hof- 
mann, Jackson Pollock (qq.v ), and Arshile 
Gorky (Vosdanig Adoian, 1904-48) experi- 
mented with expressionist abstraction Pollock 
developed a unique approach to the picture 
space based on interlacing lines that seemed to 
extend in an infinite arabesque Willem de 
Kooning (q v ), using broad impasto strokes, 
also broached virtually infinite spaces in his 
rhythmic abstractions of the late 1940's, and 
Mark Rothko (qv) developed great glowing 
surfaces that seemed animated by an inner light 
radiating into the surrounding space These

painters, along with colleagues such as Bradley 
Walker Tomlin (1899-1953), Franz Josef Kline 
(1910-62), Philip Guston (1912- ), Clyfford Still 

(-1904- }, Robert (Burns) Motherwell (1915- ), 

and Adolph Gottlieb (1903-74) formed the nu- 
cleus of a movement that came to be called 
"'abstract expressionism'' or "The New York 
School" All of these painters were primarily 
concerned with representing their reactions to 
the world, their emotional experiences rather 
than the objective facts that occasioned them 
Developments After the 1950's. The tremen- 
dous sweep of informal intuitional approaches 
after the war subsided during the late 1950's 
when many artists began to retrieve the more 
formal, geometric tradition rooted in the work 
of the Russian constructivists (see Modern Ab- 
stract Sculpture be\ow) and the Dutch members 
of de StijL In Europe there was a new interest in 
the work of the Hungarian-born French painter 
Victor Vasarely (1908- ) and his followers, 
many of whom experimented with kinetic or 
optical effects on the two-dimensional plane 
Vasarely's "concrete" art also served to stimu- 


late experiments in three dimensions based 
largely on sensory responses to movement and 
color and deliberately divested of literary con- 
notations In the U S those members of the 
abstract-expressionist generation who had de- 
veloped the most severely reduced vocabularies 
were the "hard-edge" painters such as Barnett 
Newman (1905-70), whose giant canvases were 
often bisected by a single line, and Ad Rein- 
hardt (1913-67) who, toward the end of his life, 
painted only m colors of such low values as to 
appear black Their work became the inspiration 
for younger painters eager to depart from the 
emotional excesses of the pioneers This cool, 
objective trend in painting was developed by a 
number of young artists who worked in mathe- 
matical sequences, or series of canvases, m a dry 
and preplanned manner As if in answer, a 
whole new generation of lyrical abstractionists 
appeared in the late 1960's, many of them 
inspired by the color experiments of Morns 
Louis (1918-62) on unprimed canvas.

simultaneously throughout Europe just before 
World War 1 Some artists followed the Ruma- 
nian sculptor Constantin Brancu§i (q v ) in de- 
veloping free forms suggested by the inner 
structures of natural forms Brancu§i's ovoid 
shapes in stone and bronze later inspired such 
artists as Arp and the American Isamu Noguchi 
(q V ) A more constructive mode grew out of 
the early experiments of Picasso with collage 
reliefs fashioned from scraps of tin, wood, and 
cardboard The Russian constructivists were di- 
rectly influenced by Picasso, but tended, as did 
their leader Vladimir Tatim (1885-1953), toward 
monumentally scaled visions of weightless, 
soaring abstract structures with architectural im- 
plications The brothers Naum Gabo (Naum 
Pevsner, 1890-1977) and Antoine Pevsner 
(1887-1%2) worked with slender lines in space 
and experimented with new materials, such as 
transparent plastics, in order to reveal interior 
space and redefine the traditional conceptions 
of volumetric mass Such exploration in new 
directions was extended by Americans such as 
Alexander Calder (see under Calder), whose 
invention of the mobile created a new defini- 
tion of sculpture, David Smith (q v ), whose 
monumental play with iron and steel abstract 
forms paralleled the works of his abstract-ex- 
pressionist colleagues during the 1940's and 
1950"s, and Louise Nevelson (q v ), whose wood 
assemblages of boxed forms later emerged in 
great steel compositions In England Henry 
Moore (q v ) had long developed massive ab- 
stractions based on natural and human forms, 
as had Barbara Hepworth (q v ) During th-e 
1960's, welded sculpture received strong impe- 
tus from the works of Anthony Caro (1924- ), 
who removed his work from pedestals and set 
his sculptures in spaces that seemed appropri- 
ate to the new industrial forms Less conven- 
tional developments in sculpture during the 
1960's and early 1970's included a new genre 
dubbed "'earth art", in which the artists worked 
directly m the landscape: creating stone config- 
urations in running streams; building artificial 
mountains in the desert, modifying waterfalls 
(by means of steel wires), and ploughing de- 
signs into abandoned fields See also Art The 
Modern Era D.A. 

ABSTRACT OF TITLE, in law, a brief and or- 
derly statement m writing of the successive con- 
veyances and other events concerning real 
property (land) An abstract of title should fur- 
nish a complete history of the title to be trans- 
ferred, showing not only the origin and nature 
of the interest of the seller, but also all encum- 
brances and other interests, such as mortgages. 


easements, recorded judgments, and trusts 
(qv) that affect his title (see Judgment, Mort- 
gage) In the United States, public records pro- 
vide the information for an abstract of title 
After entering into a contract of sale, a pur- 
chaser of land generally employs a lawyer or a 
title-abstract company to make a search of the 
title, and to make a report thereon, which usu- 
ally includes an abstract of title If a company is 
employed, it may also guarantee the title by as- 
suming financial responsibility for any defects 
in the title not revealed in the search The pur- 
chaser then either closes the contract of sale, or 
he refuses to accept the title because of defects 
shown in the abstract or refuses to accept it 
until such defects are cured by the seller A sim- 
ilar procedure is generally followed by a mort- 
gagee before lending money on a mortgage in 
these cases the fee for the title search is usually 
paid by the mortgagor

about 170 miles s of Asw^n The temples were 
carved into a sandstone cliff about 1250 bc dur- 
ing the reign of Ramses II (see under Ramses) 
The interior of the larger temple is over 180 ft in 
depth and consists of a series of halls and cham- 
bers leading to a central sanctuary. This temple 
was dedicated by Ramses II to the chief gods of 
Heliopolis, Memphis, and Thebes It is oriented 
so that the rays of the rising sun illuminate the 
statues of the three gods and of Ramses II m the 
innermost sanctuary The smaller temple was 
dedicated by Ramses to his queen, Nefertari (fl 
13th century b c ) and to the goddess Hathor, see 
Egyptian Religion The facade of the larger tem- 
ple has four sitting statues of Ramses II, each 
over 65 ft in height Smaller statues of Ramses 
11, Nefertari, and their children adorn the facade 
of Nefertari's temple The larger temple has nu- 
merous inscriptions and reliefs, some of them of 
unusual historical interest A series of reliefs de- 
picts the battle between the Egyptians and the 
Hittites (q V ) at Kadesh Two of the large sitting 
statues of Ramses have inscriptions m Greek 
dating from the 6th century bc They were writ- 
ten by Greek mercenary soldiers and are among 
the earliest dated Greek inscriptions. 

The temples, the most important monuments 
of ancient Nubia (q v ), were unknown to the 
West until 1812 when they were discovered by 
the Swiss traveler Johann Ludwig Burckhardt 
(1747-1817) In 1964 an international project was 


begun to save the temples from inundation by 
Lake Nasser, the reservoir of the AswSn High 
Dam (qv) In a remarkable engineering feat 
the temples were cut apart and, m 1968, reas- 
sembled on a site 210 ft above the river 
ABUTILON, genus of tender shrubs, m the 
family Mallow (q v ), commonly known as flow-

and bell-shaped flowers of various colors about 
1 to 3 in long In subtropical regions of the 
United States they grow in gardens, in cooler re- 
gions they are grown in greenhouses and as

ABYDOS, name of two ancient cities 1. City 
m Asia Minor, on the Hellespont (now Dardan- 
elles), opposite the ruined town of Sestos. The 
Persian ruler Xerxes I (q v ) bridged the Helles- 
pont at Abydos in 480 BC, m order to invade 
Greece In Greek legend, Abydos is celebrated 
as the scene of the story of Hero and Leander 
(see Hero) 2. City of Egypt, on the w bank of 
the Nile R , about 100 miles n of the ancient city 
of Thebes It was founded in prehistoric times, 
as evidenced by various archeological discover- 
ies, including royal tombs Most of the Egyptian 
kings of the I and II Dynasties (3400?-2980 bc) 
were buried there Between the I Dynasty and 
the end of the XXVI Dynasty (525 bc) one' sec- 
tion of the town was the site of nine successive 
temples The Great Temple of Abydos, con- 
structed on another site during the reign (1313- 
1292 BC) of Seti I (see under Seti), is in remark- 
ably good condition 
ABYSSINIA. See Ethiopia 
ACACIA, important genus of trees or shrubs, 
of the family Leguminosae (q v ) Most of the 
450 species of the genus are native to tropical 
Africa or Australia The normal type of leaf is 
bipinnate, but it is often modified, especially 
among the species which have had to adapt to 
the intense heat and drought of Australia The 
Australian species have vertical phyllodia (leaf- 
stalks) instead of leaves The genus is of great 
and varied economic importance, yielding edi- 
ble seeds and valuable timber and gum 
ACADEMIC FREEDOM, right of teachers and

generally m countries in which education is re- 
garded as a means not only of inculcating estab- 
lished views but also of enlarging the existing 
body of knowledge The concept of academic 
freedom implies also that tenure of office de- 
pends primarily on the competence of a teacher 
in his field and on his acceptance of certain 
standards of professional integrity rather than 
on extraneous considerations such as political 
or religious beliefs or affiliations 
The concept and practice of academic free- 
dom, as recognized presently in Western civili- 
zation, date roughly from the 17th century Al- 
though academic freedom existed in uni- 
versities during the Middle Ages, it signified at 
that time certain juristic rights, for example, the 
right of autonomy and of civil or ecclesiastical 
protection enjoyed by the several guilds that 
comprised a studium generale, or universitas 
(see Universities and Colleges) Prior to the 17th 
century, intellectual activities at universities 
were circumscribed largely by theological con- 
siderations, and opinions or conclusions that 
conflicted with religious doctrines were likely 
to be condemned as heretical In the late 17th 
century the work of such men as the English 


123 



ACADEMIC FREEDOM 


philosophers John Locke and Thomas Hobbes 
(qq V ) helped pave the way for academic free- 
dom in the modern sense Their writings dem- 
onstrated the need for unlimited inquiry in the 
sciences and for a general approach to learning 
unimpeded by preconceptions of any kind 
However, neither Locke nor Hobbes defended 
unlimited academic freedom The German uni- 
versities of Halle and Gottingen, founded in 
1694 and 1737 respectively, were the first Euro- 
pean universities to enjoy broad academic free- 
dom, with few lapses, from their inception The 
University of Berlin, founded in 1810, intro- 
duced the doctrine of Lehr- und Lernfreiheit 
('Treedom to teach and study") and helped to 
strengthen Germany's position as the leader of 
academic freedom in the 19th century In the 
18th and 19th centuries universities m Western 
Europe, Great Britain, and the United States en- 
joyed increasing academic freedom as accept- 
ance of the experimental methods of the sci- 
ences became more widespread and as control 
of institutions by religious denominations be- 
came less rigorous In Great Britain, however, 
religious tests for graduation, fellowships, and 
teaching positions were not abolished until late 
in the 19th century 

During the first half of the 20th century aca- 
demic freedom was recognized broadly m most 
Western countries However, infringements of 
the right increased as totalitarianism (q v ) 
emerged in various countries, notably in Ger- 
many, Italy, and the Soviet Union Educators in 
Italy were forced to pledge support to the Fas- 
cist regime, see Fascism Similar restrictions, in- 
cluding the teaching of racist theories m some 
fields, were enforced in German universities 
under National Socialism (q v ) In the Soviet 
Union academic freedom was and is limited by 
the necessity of making all instruction and re- 
search conform to particular Communist doc- 
trines in every field of learning From time to 
time the politburo of the central committee of 
the Soviet Communist Party lays down decrees 
establishing the sanctioned Marxist-Lenimst 
viewpoint in various academic disciplines 

infringements of academic freedom occurred 
also m the U S m the 20th century A notable 
example was the conviction, in the Scopes trial, 
held in Dayton, Tenn , in 1925, of a high-school 
teacher accused of violating a State law that for- 
bade the teaching of the theory of evolution in 
the public schools, see Bryan, Wiluam Jennings, 
Fundamentalism Since that time this legislation 
has remained unenforced After World War II 
there was widespread fear that members of the 
Communist Party had infiltrated the field of ed- 


ucation, and some educators were accused of 
Communist Party membership or of being 
under Communist Party discipline A number of 
teachers so accused were dismissed on the 
ground that their official instructions as party 
members required them to use their teaching 
positions for purposes of Communist indoctri- 
nation, and that they were consequently guilty 
of violating professional ethics In the early 
1950's, largely because of Congressional investi- 
gations of Communism in the U S , many insti- 
tutions of higher learning adopted regulations 
requiring loyalty oaths from members of their 
faculties Some of these oaths, insofar as they 
were required only of teachers, were declared 
unconstitutional in some State courts However, 
the right of Congress to question teachers about 
their membership in the Communist Party was 
upheld by the U S Supreme Court 

During the 1960's and early 1970's, m the U S 
and other countries, groups of students asserted 
their right to what they conceived to be aca- 
demic freedom for students, claiming an active 
role m determining policy on curriculum, exam- 
inations, evaluation of professors, student life 
and behavior, and privileges They often accom- 
panied their demands with demonstrations and 
even violence Consequently, theirs seemed the 
dominant voice, though in the U S the majority 
of college students remained moderate and 
nonviolent In many countries the tendency was 
to grant concessions to students more for the 
sake of peace than out of principled agreement 
As a result, students began to enjoy more 
freedom of expression not only in political 
matters, which in English-speaking and some 
Asian countries they already enjoyed, but in 
educational matters as well Some academicians 
and social critics considered this the era of 
student power and the decline of the faculty as 
the ultimate authority 

With the end of the participation of American 
troops in the war in Vietnam in 1973 and the 
termination of the draft, a marked change oc- 
curred in U S student attitudes For the most 
part, activists lost their influence, and students 
returned to the traditional preoccupations of 
academic life, demonstrating a single-minded 
interest in their studies In Western Europe, 
however, the unrest continued, with extremists 
terrorizing faculties and taking over administra- 
tions in some of the world's oldest centers of 
learning

ACADEMY 


versity Professors, are opposed to special loyalty 
oaths and to all violations of academic freedom 
There is a genera! consensus that the faculties of 
institutions of higher learning are the bodies 
best qualified to enforce the standards of pro- 
fessional ethics and integrity SH & WW B 
ACADEMY, originally, in ancient Greece, a 
public garden outside of Athens, dedicated to 
Athene and other deities and containing a grove 
and a gymnasium In these gardens the Greek 
philosopher Plato (q v ) met with and instructed 
his followers, and his informal school came to 
be known as the Academy Subsequent schools 
of philosophy, modeled upon Plato's, were also 
called academies, the term was eventually used 
m ancient times to indicate any institution of 
higher education or the faculty of such an insti- 
tution The most notable academies of the an- 
cient world were the Old Academy, founded by 
Plato, the Middle Academy, founded by the 
Greek Platonic philosopher Arcesilaus (316-241 
BC), and the New Academy, founded by the 
Greek skeptic philosopher Carneades (q v ) 

As a term used to denote a school, the word 
''academy" has come to be applied to certain 
kinds of institutions of learning The Rnteraka- 
demien, or schools for knights, appeared in- 
creasingly m Germany after the end of the 
Thirty Years' War in 1648 The term "academy" 
was adopted m England during the late 17th and 
m the 18th centuries by Puritan religious sects as 
a name for secondary schools that they organ- 
ized to provide for the general education of 
their children, these institutions were especially 
designed to tram young men for the Puritan 
ministry, because such education could not be 
obtained in contemporary public schools. The 
word gradually lost its religious denotation, and 
by the 19th century was a general term for a sec- 
ondary school for boys corresponding roughly 
to the gymnasium (q v ) in Germany In colonial 
America, the term "academy" was introduced 
by Benjamin Franklin (q v ), his proposal re- 
sulted in the chartering (1753) of the Academy 
and Charitable School in the Province of Penn- 
sylvania. In 1755 It was renamed the College, 
Academy and Charitable School of Philadelphia 
(now the University of Pennsylvania), with 
power to grant degrees On the secondary- 
school level, the earliest academies, Phillips An- 
dover and Phillips Exeter, founded in 1780 and 
1781, respectively, introduced a modern curricu- 
lum The academies were private, religion- 
oriented boarding schools As they displaced 
the colonial Latin grammar schools, so were 
they largely superseded by the public high 
school after the American Civil War, those 


which surxive, and other similar institutions, 
have largely become coliege-preparatory 
schools 

As a designation for a school, the term "acad- 
emy" IS also used m a looser sense to indicate 
institutions in which special accomplishments 
such as horseback ndmg, fencing, or dancing 
are taught Another use m this sense is the ap- 
plication of the term to schools which prepare 
students for a particular profession, in the 
United States the term is used with this mean- 
ing in the titles of the United States Military 
Academy, the United States Naval Academy, 
and the United States Air Force Academy

As a term meaning a body of learned men 
(originally the faculty of a school of philoso- 
phy), the word "academy" has come to be ap- 
plied to various associations of scholars, artists, 
literary men, and scientists, organized for the 
promotion of general or special intellectual or 
artistic interests, and not necessarily connected 
with any distinct school Thus, the Frankish em- 
peror Charlemagne (q v ) applied the name m 
782 to a group of scholars organized at his court 
During the Renaissance academies achieved an 
intellectual prominence rivaling that of the uni- 
versities, and first displayed their typical mod- 
ern form, see Education Humamsm and the 
Renaissance They characteristically consisted of 
a group of elected or appointed investigators, 
generally under royal or state patronage, who 
encouraged learning, literature, and art by re- 
search and publication In the 15th century im- 
portant academies were organized in Italy, 
notably at the courts of the Italian rulers Lo- 
renzo and Cosimo de' Medici, see Medici In 
Italy, too, one of the earliest academies devoted 
to science was organized m Naples in 1560, a 
later academy founded in the same city m 1603 
included the Italian scientist Galileo Galilei 
(q V ) among its members Scientific academies 
such as the Royal Society of London for Improv- 
ing Natural Knowledge (q.v ), founded m Lon- 
don in 1662, have played roles of the highest im- 
portance in scientific progress by encouraging 
investigations and publicizing their results 
Stimulated by royal patronage and more effi- 
cient methods of communication among schol- 
ars, the foundation of academies reached its 
height in Germany and northeastern Europe 
during the 18th century. In France, the most cel- 
ebrated of all collections of academies was or- 
ganized in 1795 as the Institute of France (q v ) 
The institute now contains five distinct academ- 
ies, ail but one of which were founded as inde- 
pendent institutions in the 17th century, among

the most notable of these institutions are the 
French Academy and the academies of science 
and art 

In the U 5, academies have not attained the 
complexity and prestige of their European mod- 
els because American scholars and scientists 
have traditionally preferred to organize in 
learned societies open to all qualified applicants 
and independent of government support Amer- 
ican academies of the European type include 
the National Academy of Design, the National 
Academy of Sciences, and the American Acad- 
emy of Arts and Letters {qq v ) The last-named 
academy, a counterpart of the French Academy, 
IS a subsidiary division of the National Institute 
of Arts and Letters (see Institute of Arts and Let- 
ters, National), which is in turn modeled upon 
the Institute of France SH &WWB

neutral in the Anglo-French conflicts, suffered 
greatly In 1755, because of renewed war with 
France, the Seven Years' War (q v ), and doubts 
as to the loyalty of the Acadians, the British co- 
lonial authorities removed the Acadians from 
their lands, dispossessed them of their property, 
and dispersed them among the other British

control with the victory of Philip II (q v ), King 
of Macedon, at the Battle of Chaeronea After 
nearly a century under Macedon, Acarnania was 
partitioned between the states of Aetolia and 
Epirus, but the Epirote section regained its inde- 
pendence in 230 BC The Acarnanians sided with 
Philip V (qv) of Macedon in his unsuccessful 
wars against Rome, they were forced to send 
hostages to Rome m 167 bc Rome, however, al- 
lowed Acarnania to retain its own government 
until about 22 bc, when Augustus (qv), the 
first Roman emperor, reorganized the provinces 
of the empire Some Acarnanians were then 
transported to the emperor's new city of Ni- 
copolis while the rest remained in the province 
of Achaea See Greece History 
ACCELERATION, rate at which the velocity of 
a body increases per unit of time Acceleration 
IS called uniform acceleration if the rate of in- 
crease remains the same over successive and 
equal intervals of time A decrease in velocity is 
sometimes called negative acceleration, and 
sometimes deceleration Angular acceleration is 
the rate at which the velocity of a body in- 
creases when It IS moving in a curved path The 
force of gravity (see Gravitation) will impart to 
a body falling freely m a vacuum an acceleration 
that depends on the distance above sea level 
The standard value of the acceleration of a 
freely falling body, m vacuum, at sea level and 
45® latitude, is 3217 ft per second per second 
ACCELERATOR, in chemistry, any substance 
added to a chemical compound to speed up the 
rate of reaction In photography, an accelerator 
speeds the action of a developer In structural 
engineering, an accelerator speeds the setting 
of concrete, in the rubber industry, an accelera- 
tor speeds the vulcanization of rubber In the 
manufacture of plastics, an accelerator is used 
to speed up the curing of epoxy and other resm- 
type plastics 

Accelerators are also devices used by physical 
scientists to impart very high velocities to 
charged nuclear particles and ions being used as 
projectiles against atoms and atomic nuclei See 
Accelerators Particle, Nuclear Energy 
ACCELERATORS, PARTICLE, in physics, ma- 
chines used in nuclear research, see Accelera- 
tor, Atom and Atomic Theory, Nuclear Reac- 
tions Nuclear particle accelerators today are 
some of the largest and most expensive instru- 
ments used by physicists Yet each of them has 
the same three basic parts as the accelerator 
used by the British scientists John D Cockcroft 
and Ernest T S Walton (qq v ), a source of 
charged particles or ions (charged nuclei), a 
tube pumped to a partial vacuum m which the

stage of acceleration for protons in a large synchrotron

particles can travel freely, and some means of 
speeding up the particles, see Nuclear Energy, 
Nucleus The key to accelerating particles is that 
like electrical charges repel each other, whereas 
unlike charges attract each other By placing 
electrodes (see Electrode) with a large potential 
difference at each end of an evacuated tube, 
Cockcroft and Walton were able to accelerate 
protons to 125,000 to 250,000 volts, see Proton 
The Van de Craaff accelerator which was 
originated in 1931 by the American physicist 
Robert jemison Van de Graaff, is similar to vari- 
ous forms of apparatus that have been used for 
many years in laboratories to obtain discharges 
of static electricity This machine builds up a 
tremendous potential between two electrodes 
by bodily transporting charges on a moving belt 
Modern Van de Graaff accelerators can achieve 
energies as high as 15 million electron volts 
(mev) High-energy physicists use the "electron 
volt" as a unit of energy This is the energy 
gained by one electron (q v ) in falling across 
one volt potential difference Because the 
charge of the proton is as great as the charge of 
the electron, its energy also is measured m elec- 
tron volts See Van de Graaff Generator 
Another machine, first conceived in the late 
1920's, is the linear accelerator or linac, which 
uses alternating voltages of high magnitude to 
push particles along to a target in many small 


128 




steps Particles pass through a line of hollow 
metal tubes enclosed in an evacuated cylinder 
An alternating voltage is timed so that a particle 
IS pushed forward each time it goes through a 
gap between two of the metal tubes It is theo- 
retically possible to build a Imac of any energy, 
depending on the availability of space and 
money The largest Imac in the world, at Stan- 
ford University, is 2 mi long It ts capable of ac- 
celerating electrons to an energy of 20 billion 
electron volts (bev) 

Ernest O Lawrence (q v ) of the University of 
California won the 1939 Nobel Prize in physics 
for a breakthrough in accelerator design in the 
early 1930's This was the development of the 
cyclotron (q v ), the first circular accelerator. A 
cyclotron is somewhat like a Imac wrapped up 
into a tight spiral Instead of many tubes, the 
machine has only two hollow vacuum tubes 
shaped like capital letter D"s back to back (thus 
Q D) A magnetic field surrounds the tubes to 
keep the particles moving m a circle Each time 
the charged particles pass through the gap be- 
tween the tubes they are accelerated, they are 
accelerated twice per revolution As the parti- 
cles gam energy, they spiral m increasing circles 
Finally they are shot out of the accelerator into 
nuclear targets 

When nuclear particles m a cyclotron gam an 
energy of 20 mev or more, they gam appreciably 
m mass This tends to slow them down and 
throws the acceleration pulses at the gaps be- 
tween the tubes out of phase A solution to this 
problem was suggested m 1945 by the Soviet 
physicists Vladimir I Veksler (1907-66) and the 
American physicist Edwin M. McMillan (q v ), of 
the University of California The solution, the 
synchrocyclotron, is sometimes called the fre- 
quency modulated cyclotron In this instrument

the oscillator (radio-trequency generator) that 
accelerates the particles around the D's is 
tuned, as the particles gam mass, the frequency 
of accelerations is lowered slightly to keep in 
step w'lth them As the maximum energy of a 
synchrocyclotron increases, so must its size in- 
crease, tor the particles must have bigger and 
bigger spirals to whirl m The largest synchrocy- 
clotron is the 236-mch '^phasotron'" at the 
Dubna joint Institute for Nuclear Research m 
the Soviet Union This instrument, which accel- 
erates protons to 680 mev, has magnets w'eigh- 
ing 7200 tons 

When electrons are accelerated, they undergo 
a large increase in mass at a relatively low en- 
ergy At 1 mev energy, an electron weighs two 
and one half times as much as an electron at 
rest Synchrocyclotrons cannot be adapted to 
make allowance for such large increases m 
masses Therefore, another type of cyclic accel- 
erator, the betatron (q v ) is employed to accel- 
erate electrons 

The synchrotron is the most recent and most 
powerful member of the accelerator family A 
synchrotron resembles a doughnut with a toroi- 
dal evacuated particle '"racetrack"' running be- 
tween the poles of a ring of magnets The parti- 
cles are confined to a tight circle and enter the 
"racetrack" after already being accelerated to 
several million electron volts Particles are accel- 
erated at one or more points on the magnet ring 
each time they pass around it To keep the parti- 
cles m a rigid orbit, the strengths of the magnets 
m the ring are increased slowly In a few sec- 
onds the particles reach energies greater than 1 
bev and are ejected, either directly into experi-

merits or into nuclear targets in which what has 
been termed beams of other fundamental parti- 
cles are produced for study. The synchrotron 
principle can be applied to either protons or 
electrons, although most of the large machines 
are proton-synchrotrons A lO-bev electron syn- 
chrotron was completed m 1%7 on the campus 
of Cornel! University, Ithaca, NY 

The first accelerator to exceed the 1-bev mark 
was the cosmotron, a proton-synchrotron at 
Brookhaven National Laboratory (q v ) The cos- 
motron was operated at 2 3 bev in 1952 and later 
increased to 3 bev In the mid-1960's two oper- 
ating synchrotrons were regularly accelerating 
protons to energies of about 30 bev These were 
the Alternating Gradient Synchrotron at Brook- 
haven and a similar machine near Geneva, 
Switzerland, operated by the European Center 
for Nuclear Energy Research (C E.R N ) A 12 7- 
bev synchrotron of different design, con- 
structed to provide the most intense beams of 
high-energy particles, was in operation at Ar- 
gonne National Laboratory, Argonne, III A 76- 
bev proton-synchrotron at Serpukhov, near 
Moscow, in the USSR, underwent Ts first full- 
scale tests in November, 1967 

The most powerful proton-synchrotron in the 
world in the middle 1970's was the Fermi 
National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab) at 
Batavia, near Chicago, III The accelerator com- 
plex, named after the Italian-born American and 
Nobel Prize-wmnmg physicist Enrico Fermi 
(q V ), has a mam circular ring that is 4 mi in 
circumference. Late in 1972, a 400-bev proton 
beam was passed through the huge accelerator 
for the first time, and in 1975 physicists at 
Fermilab predicted that the machine might 
eventually operate at energies in excess of 1000 
bev 

The availability of accelerators with a wide 
variety of capabilities has given the nuclear sci- 
entists many kinds of high-speed '"bullets" to 
explore atoms Machines with capacities of mil- 
lions of electron volts are used to produce and 
study nuclei, leading to the identification of 
new elements (see Elements, Chemical) and iso- 
topes (see Isotope) and the explanation of phe- 
nomena that affect the entire nucleus Ma- 
chines exceeding 1 bev are employed to study 
the fundamental particles that compose the nu- 
cleus Nearly fifty of these particles have been 
identified High-energy physicists hope to dis- 
cover rules or principles that will permit an or- 
derly arrangement of the proportion of subnu- 
clear particles Such an arrangement would be 
as useful to nuclear science as the periodic law 
(q.v.) IS to chemistry. J T S. 


ACCENT, in language, special stress as distinct 
from pitch on one syllable of a spoken word 
which makes that syllable more prominent than 
the others If stress is placed upon the entire 
word in a sentence, that word is emphasized, 
but if one syllable of the word is stressed, that 
syllable is accented Accent is to words what 
emphasis is to sentences In dictionaries the ac- 
cents are indicated by such symbols as ' to indi- 
cate a primary or mam stress and " to indicate a 
secondary stress Every English word has one or 
more stressed syllables Frequently the second- 
ary stress IS placed on an early syllable of a 
word, as m rec" om mend' and res" to ra' tion, 
sometimes it falls on the last, as in down' pour" 
and drum' head". By changing the accent, many 
nouns may be made verbs, as ob' ject — ob ject' 
Stress accent is more complex in the English lan- 
guage than in most of the ancient and modern 
languages of the world The meters of English 
poetry are determined entirely by accent, rather 
than by the quantities of vowels, see Versifi- 
cation 

ACCESSORY, in criminal law, accomplice in 
the commission of an offense as distinguished 
from the chief offender An accessory before 
the fact IS one who deliberately instigates others 
to commit an offense, but who does not himself 
take a direct part in the offense An accessory 
after the fact is one who, knowing that an of- 
fense has been committed, takes active steps to 
shelter the offender from justice or to enable 
him to escape Accessories must be distin- 
guished from principals in the second degree, 
that IS, persons who, although not the actual 
perpetrators of the crime, were nevertheless 
present and aided and abetted in the commis- 
sion of the offense The tendency of modern 
legislation has been to convert accessories be- 
fore the fact into principals, and an accessory 
before the fact is often subject to a punishment 
as severe as that imposed upon a principal An 
accessory after the fact, on the other hand, is 
subject to less severe penalties 
ACCESS, RIGHT OF, legal incident of the 
ownership of property abutting on the sea or 
other navigable waters, or on a highway or 
other public lands It is of the nature of a servi- 
tude or easement (q v ) Access to air as against 
a neighboring proprietor can be acquired only 
as an easement The right of access to a highway 
over the land of another is also of the nature of 
an easement that will m certain cases, as when 
such access is necessary for entrance and exit, 
be presumed to exist 

ACCIDENT, unintended and unforeseen 
event, usually resulting in personal injury or 


130 



ACCLIMATIZATION 


property damage In law the term is usually lim- 
ited to events not involving negligence (q v ), 
the carelessness or misconduct of a party in- 
volved, or a loss caused by lightning, floods, or 
other natural events, see Act of God In popular 
usage, however, the term ''accident'' designates 
an unexpected event, especially if it causes in- 
jury or damage without reference to the negli- 
gence or fault of an individual The basic causes 
of such accidents are, m general, unsafe condi- 
tions of machinery, equipment, or surroundings 
and the unsafe actions of persons that are 
caused by ignorance or neglect of safety prin- 
ciples 

Organized efforts for the prevention or acci- 
dents began in the 19th century with the adop- 
tion of factory-inspection laws, first in Great 
Britain and then in the United States and other 
countries, see Factories and the Factory System 
Factory Inspection Fire-insurance and accident- 
insurance companies made efforts to enforce 
safety rules and to educate the public Factor^' 
inspectors and inspectors from fire-insurance 
and casualty-insurance companies carried on a 
campaign against unsafe conditions and ac- 
tions, and at the beginning of the 20th century a 
new branch of engineering developed, devoted 
to the finding and elimination of such hazards, 
see Safety Engineering 

Laws concerning workmen's compensation 
(q V ) were passed in Germany m 1884, Great 
Britain in 1897, and the several States of the U S 
beginning m 1911 By placing on the employer 
the financial burden of caring for injured work- 
men, such laws created an incentive for provid- 
ing safe machinery and working conditions, 
and for improved selection and training of em- 
ployees In the U S , the National Safety Council 
(q V ) was formed m 1913, this noncommercial 
organization has since been a leader in acci- 
dent-prevention activities, especially in the 
publication of educational literature, the com- 
pilation of statistics, and the coordination of the 
work of schools, clubs, industrial organizations, 
and State and municipal agencies 

In 1913 the American automobile manufac- 
turer Henry Ford (q v ) introduced assembly-ime 
techniques m the manufacture of automobiles, 
see Automobile History The subsequent tre- 
mendous increase m the number of motor vehi- 
cles in use was responsible for a great rise in the 
motor-vehicle accident rate and offset a decline 
m the rate of nonmotor-vehicle accidents The 
peak in the death rate from motor-vehicle acci- 
dents was reached m 1937, when it was 30 8 per 
100,000 or the population Prior to 1937, as 
motor-vehicle accident rates were rising, public 


and private organizations, such as the Interna- 
tional Association ot Chiets ot Police and the 
national and local automobile clubs, began a 
continuing campaign tor better education ot 
drivers, stricter enforcement ot motor-vehicle 
and traffic regulations, and improvement of 
highway engineering Bv1%1 the campaign had 
resulted m a reduction ot the motor-vehicle 
death rate to 20 8 per 100, CXX) The rate rose 
somewhat subsequently and in 1973 w'as esti- 
mated at 26 6 per 100,000 

In the US in 1973 motor-vehicle accidents 
were responsible for about 47 percent of the 
total number or accidental deaths, as compared 
with about 22 percent for accidents in the 
home, about 12 percent for work accidents, and 
about 19 percent tor accidents in public places, 
or public deaths (excluding motor-vehicle but 
including railroad and airplane accidents) 
Motor-vehicle accidents were responsible for 
55,800 deaths in 1973 Aside from motor-vehicle 
accidents the greatest single cause of accidental 
death is falling, which accounts for approxi- 
mately one fifth of the fatalities 

Accidental deaths reached a high of 110,052 
in 1936, but the death rate of 85 9 per 100,000 
population was not as high as the 1906 rate of 
93 2 In 1973 the total was estimated at 117,000, 
and the rate was estimated at 55 8 per 100,000 
population In addition to the cost in lives of 
accidents, the cost in permanent impairments to 
individuals in 1973 totaled 420,000, temporary 
total disabilities reached 11,100,000 The eco- 
nomic costs of accidents in 1973 reached a total 
of $26,200,000,000 Of this total, wage losses 
accounted for $13,300,000,000, medical expenses 
for $5,400,000,000, and insurance administrative 
costs for $7,500,000,000 More than one half ot 
the total economic costs stemmed from motor 
vehicle accidents Work-related accidents ac- 
counted for about one quarter of such costs, 
home-related accidents and accidents that oc- 
curred in public places each accounted for one 
eighth.

ACCLIMATIZATION, process whereby ani- 
mals or plants become adapted to, and thrive m, 
a climate different from that to which they are 
indigenous if the difference is extreme, 
changes take place m the structure and physiol- 
ogy of the organism The reindeer is unable to 
acclimatize, removed from the cold north to the 
fertile valleys of a temperate climate, it degener- 
ates and dies On the other hand, the horse, na- 
tive to Asia, thrives in the United States Os-

Inches are raised with success in Argentina, but 
not in California Various Australasian trees, 
notably the eucalyptus, thrive in California, and 
successful experiments have also been made 
with them in the cotton-growing States, the tea 
plant also grows wet! in various parts of the U S 
The introduction of coffee into the West Indies 
IS another example of successful acclimatiza-

movement to increasingly different climates, in- 
ured to a climate completely unlike that to 
which they are native If they had been sud- 
denly transferred to such a climate, they would 
have perished On the other hand, each species 
of plant has certain limits of temperature within 
which It will succeed, and alleged instances of 
acclimatizing have merely been instances of un- 
suspected hardiness in the plant See also Ad-

ACCOMPLICE, in criminal law, any person 
who IS in any way associated with another m 
the commission or attempted commission of a

certain conditions, he is a competent witness 
either for or against hts associates at every stage 
of the proceedings 

ACCORDION, musical instrument of the 
wind group, with collapsible bellows, a key- 
board on the right side, a set of free metal reeds 
arranged in pairs (see Reed), and valves con- 
trolled by buttons or keys on the left keyboard 
The accordion is the smallest reed-organ instru- 
ment 

Two types of accordion are the chromatic and 
the piano accordion Both are played by con- 
tracting and expanding the bellows while press- 
ing the various keys or buttons This action 
opens the valves and causes a flow of air that 
makes the reeds vibrate, thus producing musical 
tones In both types the right hand plays the tre- 
ble keyboard; the left hand works the bellows, 
while the fingers of the left hand play the bass 
keyboard The bass buttons in each type also 
supply accompanying chords 

The chromatic accordion differs from the 
piano accordion in two ways* First, the treble 
keyboard of the chromatic accordion is fitted 
with buttons, that of the piano accordion is a 
piano keyboard, with a range of from one to 
three and one-half octaves Secondly, when the 
bellows of the chromatic accordion is con- 
tracted, one of the pair of reeds produces a mu- 
sical tone, when the bellows is expanded, the 
second reed sounds a musical tone a semitone 
higher or lower In the piano accordion each of 
the pair of reeds sounds the same note. 


The chromatic accordion was invented in Ber- 
lin, Germany, m 1822 The piano accordion was 
first made in Italy in 1872 and became popular 
in the United States about 1908 Of the two 
types, the piano accordion is the more popular 
among professional musicians, it is frequently 
used in dance bands and may also be used as a 
solo instrument 

ACCOUNTANT, one who makes a profession 
of accountancy, see Accounting An accountant 
may either be privately employed or engaged in 
the public practice of accountancy and offer 
services to business concerns, banks, estates, in- 
stitutions, or public bodies Accountants who 
are employees of such organizations are gener- 
ally required to set up accurate records and effi- 
cient systems of accounts, to prepare tax returns 
and accounting reports such as balance sheets 
and income statements, and to develop cost re- 
ports and other accounting data needed by the 
organizations Independent public accountants 
audit, verify, and certify the correctness of the 
financial statements issued by their clients, and 
are frequently engaged to prepare complex tax 
returns for individuals, partnerships, estates, 
trusts, and corporations A high standard of pro- 
fessional ethics and integrity must be main- 
tained by every accountant Vital information 
revealed to him m the course of his work for 
employers or for clients must be held in strict 
confidence Accountants are obligated to keep 
informed of new developments in such fields as 
taxation, governmental regulation of business, 
finance, law, and economics, as well as in ac- 
counting principles and methods 

In the United States, a person wishing to carry 
on a professional accounting practice may ob- 
tain a certificate granting him the title of certi- 
fied public accountant by complying with the 
requirements of the laws of individual States A 
summary of the qualifications necessary m New 
York State is as follows an applicant for a certif- 
icate must be over twenty-one years of age and 
show evidence of good moral character, com- 
plete a course in a recognized college of ac- 
countancy; have had three years of diversified 
accounting and auditing experience, and pass 
professional examinations given by the State in 
the fields of auditing, practical accounting, the 
theory of accounting, and commercial law 
A British accountant on a professional level 
roughly corresponding to that of a certified 
public accountant in the U S is known as a 
chartered accountant Chartered-accountant 
certificates are not granted directly by the gov- 
ernment but by a quasi-official body, the Insti- 
tute of Chartered Accountants in England and

ACCOUNTING, science of organizing, ana- 
lyzing, and interpreting business records Ac- 
counting and bookkeeping (q v ) were origmal!\ 
synonymous terms The term bookkeeping is 
now generally restricted to the keeping of the 
books, or accounting records, of a business en- 
terprise, accounting, on the other hand, in- 
cludes the determination of the methods by 
which such records are to be kept, the analysis 
of the records themselves, and the drawing of 
conclusions as to the condition and conduct of 
the enterprise Accounting demands a wide 
knowledge of business in general and a special 
knowledge of the field in question, particularly 
when complex problems of classification and 
valuation are involved, as in the assessment of 
such intangible assets as patents and goodwill 
(q V ), see Assets, below Finally, the analyses by 
an accountant (q v ) of the obligations due to 
owners, creditors, and government agencies re- 
quire an understanding of the relationship be- 
tween business and such fields as finance and 
law 

An understanding of the elements of account- 
ing may be conveyed best by detailed descrip- 
tions of the two basic types of accounting re- 
ports or statements the balance sheet and the 
income statement, or statement of profit and 
loss Other technical reports made by an ac- 
countant, such as schedules, inventory state- 
ments, and special analyses, are usually supple- 
mentary to these fundamental statements 
The Balance Sheet. A balance sheet is a com- 
prehensive report giving a financial picture of 
the condition of an enterprise at a given time 
The point most frequently selected is the last 
day of the calendar or fiscal year, many corpora- 
tions, however, prepare semiannual and quar- 
terly balance sheets Some corporations en- 
gaged in seasonal businesses adopt a so-called 
natural business year, ending at the close of a 
business season The essential fact common to 
all balance sheets is the identity between the 
total values of assets, on the one hand, and of 
obligations, on the other The latter item in- 
cludes both creditor claims and proprietary in- 
terests For example, balanced against the value 
of a $2O,0CX) house may be a $12,000 mortgage 
(creditor claim) and an $8000 equity held by the 
owner (proprietary interest) In most corporate 
structures, proprietary interests, in the form of 
capital stock and retained earnings, constitute 
the capital of a firm. Such capital, frequently 
called the net worth of the firm, must be distin- 
guished from all forms of liabilities Thus, the

pens, and all processes were handled tndnidualh

basic equation underlying the balance sheet 
may be more accurately stated as an identity be- 
tween assets, on the one hand, and liabilities 
plus net worth, on the other 
Assets. In the balance sheet, assets are gener- 
ally divided into three main categories current 
assets, fixed assets, and intangible assets 
The principal items subsumed under current 
assets are cash on hand, accounts receivable, 
and the estimated monetary value of goods on 
hand, or inventory An additional account called 
prepaid expenses, including such items as rents 
and fees that have been paid in advance, is also 
frequently listed In many cases, one or more 
special funds are placed among current assets, a 
typical example might be a sinking fund to re- 
place equipment Such a fund is not usually in 
cash, m most instances it consists of readily ne- 
gotiable bonds that are, in effect, cash at work 
earning interest until needed to purchase re- 
placement equipment Until the time that cash 
in the sinking fund is actually committed to spe- 
cific purposes, it remains part of the pool of liq- 
uid current assets, as distinct from the fixed as- 
sets for which an accounting is next made 
The Items normally listed as fixed assets are 
estimates of the monetary value of equipment 
and buildings At this point depreciation pre- 
sents particularly difficult problems In most 
modern balance sheets the values of plant and 
equipment are stated at their cost price less 
depreciation The accountant first enters the 
original cost of these items He then subtracts 
an allowance for depreciation. The difference is 
entered among the assets as the final value 


133 



ACCOUNTING 


Among the most important entries under in- 
tangible assets are patents (see Patent) and 
goodwill Ownership of a patent secures for the 
owner exclusive rights to a production process 
or invention for a fixed period Such a right 
clearly has value as an asset, since it affords a 
company opportunity for exceptional profits 
during the life of the patent Most patents are 
originally booked at cost The value placed on a 
patent m a balance sheet, however, steadily de- 
clines as the patent approaches the end of its 
period of protection In modern accounting, the 
value assigned to a patent is usually computed 
through the application of a depreciation for- 
mula similar to that used in the case of a fixed 
asset, such as a truck or machine Most intangi- 
ble assets of an enterprise are entered under the 
general category of goodwill, which covers ev- 
erything, not listed elsewhere, that might con- 
tribute to profits for example, the advantages 
the enterprise enjoys through recognition of its 
trademark, of its ability to evolve advanced de- 
signs, or of Its capacity to produce materials or 
products of lasting quality In general, an enter- 
prise either omits its own goodwill from its bal- 
ance sheet or assesses it at a nominal value, 
such as one dollar, even though its profitable 
operations would apparently warrant a substan- 
tial goodwill asset In this way the accountant 
allows for the uncertainty of future operations 
and avoids the danger of overmflating the assets 
account When a company purchases another 
company, however, an item is usually entered 
on the balance sheet under goodwill The 
amount paid for goodwill, that is, for above- 
normal earning power and enlarged capacity to 
compete, generally consists of the excess of the 
price paid over the value of the other assets pur- 
chased For example, if a firm expends $500,000 
for the purchase of another company, but re- 
ceives only $100,000 in the form of such assets 
as inventory, plant and equipment, and patents, 
the accountant is justified m entering up to 
$400,000 under goodwill to account for the ad- 
ditional value received 

Liabilities and Net Worth. Liabilities are gen- 
erally differentiated in accounting as either cur- 
rent or long-term lia,bilities, this division corre- 
sponds roughly to that between current and 
fixed assets. The normal items entered under 
current liabilities are wages payable, that is, the 
sums of money due to labor, accounts payable, 
for example, the amounts owed for goods 
bought on credit, and notes payable, that is, the 
amount pledged by promissory notes to individ- 
uals, banks, or finance companies In addition, 
most corporations include among their current 


liabilities an item called reserve for taxes, an ac- 
count in which a company accumulates funds 
for future payments to various government tax 
authorities Long-term liabilities are obligations 
that become due more than one year after the 
balance sheet date, and typically include ex- 
tended loans, such as those advanced or guar- 
anteed by the Small Business Administration 
(qv), mortgage loans, and obligations, gener- 
ally known as bonds payable, incurred through 
the flotation of bond issues, see Bond 
The principal items included under net worth, 
or capital, are issues of preferred and common 
stock, see Stock Stock shareholders receive div- 
idends from the profits of the enterprise A prof- 
itable corporation, however, does not usually 
distribute all of its net earnings in the form of 
dividends The undistributed residue is ac- 
counted for in the balance sheet and is often 
entered under capital as retained earnings 
Thus, undistributed profits are shown as con- 
tributing to an increase m net worth In prac- 
tice, this increase is rarely reflected solely in the 
cash position of an enterprise, but is invested in 
generally increased assets, such as a larger in- 
ventory or additional fixed or intangible assets, 
or in decreased liabilities, such as lowered 
short-term and long-term debts 
The Income Statement. Whereas a balance 
sheet presents a static record of the financial 
position of an enterprise at a given moment, an 
income, or profit and loss statement indicates 
the flow of activities over an extended period as 
reflected m revenues from sales and ail other 
sources, in costs, and in expenses for the entire 
period Except for cases of recapitalization, all 
changes of successive balance sheets are attrib- 
utable to the operations recorded on the inter- 
vening income statements 

In Its most common form, an income state- 
ment begins with an item listing the gross pro- 
ceeds of sales for the period covered All costs 
and charges are then subtracted from this item 
to indicate net earnings or profits The major 
cost item IS usually the manufacturing cost of 
the goods sold This item includes the costs of 
materials and labor, miscellaneous operating ex- 
penses (consisting essentially of such overhead 
costs as rent, insurance, and office expenses), 
and depreciation charges The nature of depre- 
ciation and of accounting methods of comput- 
ing gradual depreciation charges are discussed 
in a separate article, see Depreciation It may be 
pointed out here, however, that an accountant 
must be conservative in calculating deprecia- 
tion charges Because these charges are at best 
rough estimates and represent only a paper ex- 


134 




pense, as distinct from such a demonstrable ex- 
penditure as labor costs, they can sometimes be 
inflated to lower apparent profits and thus 
avoid taxes As a general rule, government tax- 
ing agencies permit a corporation to choose any 
reasonable method of computing depreciation, 
but insist that the method chosen must be used 
throughout the life of the equipment 
The deduction of such fixed charges as inter- 
est on bonds and of corporation income taxes 
yields net income after taxes From this amount 
dividends on preferred stock are first deducted 
to arrive at profits available for distribution to 
holders of common stock. Part of these profits 
may have been disbursed as dividends on com- 
mon stock, and the remainder added to retained 
earnings, which are also entered on the balance 
sheet, as stated above 

Modem Accounting. The major recent devel- 
opment in accounting technique is the intro- 
duction of modern calculating machines to re- 
place less sophisticated mechanical devices and 
manual calculation and recording, see Com- 
puter Among the important professional devel- 
opments fostered by increasingly specialized 
training is the appearance of such specialists as 
the tax accountant, specializing m the prepara- 
tion of tax returns, and the cost accountant, 
specializing in the detailed analysis of the costs 
of labor, materials, and overhead expenses Spe- 
cialization has also appeared in the accounting 
departments of most large corporations An ac- 
counting department is now generally managed 
by certified public accountants, who prepare 
accounting statements for the company and as- 
sist in the preparation of its financial budget In 
addition, general bookkeeping and internal au- 
diting, which also fall within the province of the 
accounting department, are supervised by ac- 


Man^ \%oman, and machine Electronic computers now

countants General charge of the accounting 
department is usually vested in an officer of the 
corporation, such as the treasurer or comptrol- 
ler 

Most businesses furnish financial statements, 
or accounting reports, to banks or suppliers tor 
credit purposes, and to stockholders and pro- 
spective investors Independent certified public 
accountants are generally engaged in such cases 
to audit the books and records and to certify to 
the correctness of the financial statements be- 
fore they are issued 

History, Accounting and bookkeeping share 
common origins The accountant's functions m 
such enterprises as small, individual, and part- 
nership businesses are still assumed by a book- 
keeper In ancient, medieval, and early Renais- 
sance times, bookkeepers called stewards or 
auditors, who devoted all their time to the serv- 
ice of a single individual or organizaton, per- 
formed the duties now assumed by account- 
ants The earliest recorded association of 
accountants was the Collegio dei Raxonati^ 
which was founded in Venice, Italy, m 1581, the 
members of this group may have been merely 
public employees rather than independent pro- 
fessional accountants in the modern sense of 
the term Accountancy as a profession must 
nevertheless have had a firm foothold in Italy by 
1742, for in that year the city of Milan estab- 
lished a scale of legal fees for accountants 

In Great Britain, where modern accountancy 
was first established, records for the year 1790 
indicate that only five accountants were carry- 
ing on professional practices By 1822 their 
number had increased to no more than seventy-

three At about the middle of the 19th century, 
however, the growth of large-scale corporate 
entities, exhibiting the characteristic features of 
modern joint-stock organization, greatly stimu- 
lated the opportunities and the need for trained 
accountants, see Corporation The earliest as- 
sociation of professional accountants in Great 
Britain, the Society of Accountants, was organ- 
ized in Edinburgh in 1854, later organizations 
were incorporated m Glasgow, Aberdeen, and 
London in 1855, 1867, and 1880, respectively 
The passage of the Bankruptcy Act of 1869, 
which transferred the administration of insol- 
vent estates from public officials to private 
hands, also acted as a stimulus to accountancy 
in Great Britain On the Continent the develop- 
ment of the profession did not keep pace with 
that m Great Britain, and public regulation of 
accountants was comparatively lax. Societies for 
professional accountants were, however, organ- 
ized m the Netherlands, Sweden, and Belgium 
m 1895, 1899, and 1903, respectively 
In the United States, higher education for ac- 
countancy was instituted in 1881, when the 
Wharton School of Finance and Economy of the 
University of Pennsylvania was founded By 
1900 similar schools had been established at 
New York University, Dartmouth College, and 
the universities of Chicago and Vermont. The 
most important professional organization of ac- 
countants, the American Association of Public 
Accountants, was founded in 1887, in 1916 its 
name was changed to the American Institute of 
Accountants and its membership limited to cer- 
tified public accountants Governmental regula- 
tion of the profession was begun in New York

ACHAEAN LEAGUE, confederation of ten or 
twelve Greek towns established originally by 
the ancient Achaeans (q v ), a Greek-speaking 
people living on the northern coast of the Pelo- 
ponnisos, the peninsula forming the southern 
part of Greece The original league played little 
part in the wars of the 5th century bc, but, 
toward the end of the 4th century bc, it was 
conquered by the Macedonians (see Macedo- 
nia) By 280 BC, following the death of Alexan- 
der III (qv). King of Macedonia, known as the 
Great, and the subsequent internal strife in 
Macedonia, the Achaean League was reestab- 
lished The confederacy was further strength- 
ened by the addition, between 251 and 229 bc, 
of the non-Achaean states of Sicyon, Corinth, 
Megalopolis, and Argos (see Greece History 
Hellenistic Period) The Achaean League was a 
federation Each member state or town of the 
league was autonomous, but all members par- 
ticipated in a council which met biannually to 
formulate common foreign policy and to enact 
legislation involving economic matters, such as 
coinage The leading statesmen of the Achaean 
League included the generals Aratus of Sicyon 
(271-13 BC) and Philopoemen of Megalopolis 
(253-183 BC) 

About 235 BC Cleomenes 111, King of Sparta (r 
235-19 BC), provoked a war with the league in 
an attempt to force the Achaeans into a Pelo- 
ponnisian federation After two serious defeats 
the Achaeans asked and received help from Ma- 
cedonia Cleomenes HI was finally defeated at 
Sellasia in 222 bc As the price of aid from the 
former enemy, Achaea again became subject to 
Macedonia About 198 bc the Achaeans allied 
themselves with the Romans against the Mace- 


donians During the next forty years the Romans 
completely subjugated the league, together 
with the rest of Greece, taking to Rome in 168 
BC one thousand Achaeans as hostages, among 
them the Greek historian Polybius (q v ) In 146 
BC Achaea became a Roman province that en- 
compassed all of Greece south of Thessaly and 
Macedonia G E D

terize the Achaeans as a maritime nation lo- 
cated in western Asia Minor and on the island 
of Lesbos m the Aegean Sea, see Hittites* Hitth

ACHILLES, in Greek mythology, greatest of 
the Greek warriors m the Trojan War (q v ) He 
was the son of the sea nymph Thetis and Peleus 
(qqv), King of the Myrmidons (qv) of Thes- 
saly When he was a child his mother dipped 
him into the River Styx (q v.) to make him im- 
mortal The waters of the river made him invul- 
nerable except for the heel by which his mother 
held him When the Greeks began to organize 
the expedition against Troy (q v ), Thetis, fearing 
for his life, sent her son to Scyros, an island in 
the Aegean Sea, where Achilles lived at the 
court disguised as a girl The wily Ulysses (q v ), 
King of Ithaca, discovered him, however, and 
easily persuaded him to go to Troy 
Achilles fought many battles during the ten- 
year seige of Troy When the Mycenaean king 
Agamemnon (q v ) seized the captive maiden 
Briseis from him, Achilles withdrew the Myrmi- 


dons from battle and sulked m his tent The Tro- 
jans, emboldened by his absence, attacked the 
Greeks and drove them into headlong retreat 
Then Patroclus (q v ), Achilles' friend and com- 
panion, begged Achilles to lend him his armor 
and let him lead the Mvrmidons into the battle 
Achilles consented When Patroclus was killed 
by the Trojan prince Hector (qv) the grief- 
stricken Achilles returned to battle, slew Hector, 
and dragged his body m triumph behind his 
chariot He later permitted Pnam (q v ), King of 
Troy, to ransom Hector's body, and then pre- 
pared for his own death which the Fates (q v ) 
had decreed would follow soon after the death 
of Hector. Achilles fought his last battle with 
Memnon (q v ), King of the Ethiopians After 
killing the king, Achilles led the Greeks to the 
walls of Troy There he was mortally shot m the 
heel by Pans (q v ) 

The quarrel between Achilles and Agamem- 
non, the subsequent battle, and the ransoming 
of Hector's body are recounted m the epic 
poem Iliad by Homer (qq v ). 

ACHILLES TENDON, in the legs of mammals, 
powerful, cordlike band of connective tissue 
joining the fused muscles of the calf to the bone

ACHIN or ACHEEN (Indonesian, Atjeh), for- 
mer sultanate in the nw portion of the island 
of Sumatra (q v.) Originally a dependency of 
the neighboring state of Pedir, Achin became an 
independent sultanate during the first quarter 
of the 16th century The sultanate was most 
powerful between 1607 and 1636 Imperialist 
rivalries among Portugal, Great Britain, and the 
Netherlands for control of Achin dominated its 
history during the remainder of the 17th cen- 
tury 

In 1819 the British government acquired ex- 
clusive trading privileges with the sultanate An

ACHROMATISM, in optics (q v ), property of 
a lens system of bending a beam of white light 
in such a way that all of its component colors 
are brought to a focus at the same point, thus 
obtaining a sharp image It is impossible for a 
single lens to achieve achromatic focus because 
different wavelengths of light are bent by differ- 
ing amounts as they pass through the lens (see 
Spectrum) It is necessary to combine at least 
two lenses made of glass having different refrac- 
tive indexes The principle was discovered in 
1757 by John Dollond (1706-61), a British opti-

ACIDOSIS. See Blood Homeostatic Reac~ 
tions 

ACIDS, originally, substances that m solution 
in water have a sour taste, the intensity of the 
sourness depending on the strength of the acid 
The meaning of the term, however, has grown 
with the development of chemical theory Cur- 
rently the sourness of acids is attributed to hy- 
drogen ions (see Ion), often written as H3O+, 
that are formed, along with negative ions, when 
an acid dissolves in water For example, hydro- 
gen chloride, HCI, when dissolved in water, is 
almost completely converted into H 3 O+ and 
Cl" ions, and it functions as a strong acid Weak 

140 


acids are those that are transformed only par- 
tially into H 3 O+ and negative ions 
The H 3 O+ ions confer on acid solutions cer- 
tain other properties. The solutions are electri- 
cal conductors (see Electro-chemistry), they ac- 
celerate corrosion of active metals such as alu- 
minum, iron, and zinc, they change the color of 
many materials, for example, they turn blue lit- 
mus red; and the stronger acids liberate carbon 
dioxide from limestone and other metal carbon-

The Danish chemist Johannes Nicolaus 
Bronsted (1879-1947) and the British chemist 
Thomas Martin Lowry (1874-1936) classified 
acids as all the substances that supply protons 
(see Proton), which are identical to H+ ions, in 
chemical reactions Thus hydrogen chloride 
supplies protons to water molecules, resulting 
in formation of 1430 “** ions and Ch ions On this 
basis sodium bicarbonate, NaHCOj, 1 $ an acid 
because it surrenders protons to caustic alkalies; 
its solutions are not sour, however, and do not 
show the other properties ascribed to H 3 O+ 
The broadest definition of acids is that of the 
American chemist Gilbert Newton Lewis (1875- 
1946), who defined them as species that accept 
pairs of electrons (see Electron) when forming 
bonds with other substances. Thus protons are 
acids when they accept electron pairs m joining 
with water molecules to give H 3 O+ ions Boron 
tnfluoride, BF3, acts as an acid, that is, it accepts 
electron pairs, when it combines with ammonia,

acids IS that it groups together a wide variety of 
reactions that seem otherwise unrelated.

ACNE, or ACNE VULGARIS, eruptive skin dis- 
ease. It IS primarily a disorder of the sebaceous 
follicles of the skin and appears most often on 
the face, neck, and back The natural secretion, 
or sebum, of the follicles accumulates and mixes 
with dust and dirt The follicle and surrounding 
tissue become inflamed and blackheads appear. 
If the follicle opening completely closes, the ac- 
cumulated sebum forms an inflamed cyst. Acne 
IS primarily a disorder of adolescence and is re- 
lated to the hormonal changes during this pe-

maintenance of good general health, avoidance 
of rich and oily foods, vaccine or hormone ther-

ROSACEA, disease m which the capillaries in 
the cheeks, forehead, and especially the nose, 
are swollen with blood and the oily glands in 
the skin become infected, forming pimple-like, 
pus-filled swellings. It is believed the principal 
cause IS poor digestion resulting from improper 
diet and, frequently, excessive consumption of 


alcohol. Other causes include infections of the 
nasal passages, hormone disturbances, and 
emotional stress Treatment is removal of the 
basic cause, with the pimples being treated as

of the Northern Hemisphere. Several species, 
including A. napellus, a well-known European 
species, are cultivated as garden plants in the 
United States The common aconites have fi- 
brous or tuberous roots, mostly erect stems, and 
palmately divided or cleft leaves The flowers in 
most species are blue or purple, although some 
species have yellow or white flowers. The outer, 
showy parts of the bilaterally symmetrical 
flower are five in number and the uppermost is 
formed into a large, downward-opening hood.

ACOUSTICS (Gr akouein, "to hear"), term 
sometimes used for the science of sound in 
general, but more commonly for the special 
branch of that science, architectural acoustics, 
that deals with the construction of rooms, pub- 
lic halls, churches, theaters, and radio, televi- 
sion, and sound-recording studios so as to en- 
hance the hearing of speech or music. For the 
treatment of acoustics as a branch of the pure 
science of physics, see Sound, 

The acoustics of buildings was an undevel- 
oped aspect of the study of sound until compar- 
atively recent times The Roman architect Mar- 
cus Vitruvius Pollio, who flourished during the 

142 


1st century bc, made some pertinent observa- 
tions on the subject, and some astute guesses 
concerning reverberation and interference The 
scientific aspects of this subject, however, were 
first thoroughly treated by the American physi- 
cist Joseph Henry (q v ) m 1856, and more fully 
developed by the American physicist Wallace 
Clement Ware Sabine (1868-1919) in 1900 
Problems of Design. Acoustical design must 
take into consideration that in addition to phys- 
iological peculiarities of the ear (q v ), hearing is 
complicated by psychological peculiarities For 
example, sounds that are unfamiliar seem un- 
natural. Sound produced in an ordinary room is 
somewhat modified by reverberations due to 
reflections from walls and furniture, for this rea- 
son, a broadcasting studio should have a normal 
degree of reverberation to insure natural repro- 
duction of sound For best acoustic qualities, 
rooms are designed to produce sufficient reflec- 
tions for naturalness, without introducing ex- 
cessive reverberation at any frequency, without 
echomg certain frequencies unnaturally, and 
without producing undesirable interference ef- 
fects or distortion. See also Audition 

A criterion of the overall reflective qualities of 
a room is its so-called reverberation time An 
appreciable reverberation time improves the 
acoustical effect, especially for music, a loud 
sound should still be barely audible for one to 
two seconds after the source of sound has 
stopped m an auditorium, in a room in a private 
home a shorter but still discernible reverbera- 
tion time is desirable The optimum reverbera- 
tion time for best acoustics varies with the vol- 
ume of the room, and also depends on whether 
the room is used primarily for purposes of 
speech or for music. 

Materials. For modifying the reverberations, 
the architect has two types of materials, sound- 
absorbent and sound-reflecting, at his disposal 
for coating the surfaces of ceilings, walls, and 
floors. Soft materials such as cork and felt ab- 
sorb most of the sound that strikes them, al- 
though they may reflect some of the low-fre- 
quency sounds. Hard materials such as stone 
and metals reflect most of the sound that strikes 
them The acoustics of a large auditorium may 
be very different when it is full than the acous- 
tics when it is empty, empty seats frequently re- 
flect sound, whereas an audience absorbs 
sound. 

In most cases the acoustics of a room will be 
satisfactory if a proper balance between sound- 
absorbing and sound-reflecting materials is 
created Troublesome echoes may occur as a 
genera! rule m a room that otherwise has a 



proper overall reverberation time if the ceiling 
or a wall -IS concave in shape and is highly re- 
flecting, in such cases, sound may be focused at 
a particular point, making the acoustics bad at 
that point m the room Similarly, a narrow corri- 
dor between parallel reflecting walls may trap 
sound by repeated reflection and cause trouble- 
some echoes, even though the overall absorp- 
tion IS sufficient Similar problems are encoun- 
tered in the design of the shell-shaped sounding 
boards of outdoor structures such as band 
stands In addition to control of echoes and 
reverberation, attention must also be given to 
the elimination of interference. Such interfer- 
ence arises from difference in the distances 
traversed by the direct and the reflected sound, 
and produces so-called dead spots, in which 
certain ranges of frequency are canceled out. 
Reproduction of sound picked up by micro- 
phones also requires the elimination of echoes 
and interference 

Insulation. Another important aspect of room 
acoustics IS insulation from unwanted sounds, 
as in apartment houses, broadcast studios, or re- 
search facilities. Good insulation is obtained by 
carefully sealing even the smallest openings that 
can leak sound, by using massive walls, and by 
building several unconnected walls separated 
by dead spaces See Insulation 

To evaluate the acoustical properties of 
rooms and materials, the acoustical scientist 
uses tools such as anechoic chambers and 
sound-level meters The development of the an- 
echoic chamber, which is a room free from 
echoes and reverberations, in which all sound is 
absorbed by glass-fiber wedges placed on the 
surfaces of the walls, has enabled scientists to 
learn more about hearing and about sound ma- 
terials. A good anechoic chamber is so quiet 
that It is possible to hear the blood circulating 
in one's own head 

A sound-level meter measures sound pressure 
or intensity which is related to the loudness of a 
sound, and expresses the result in decibels, a 
logarithmic unit In a quiet residence the sound- 
level meter would read about 38 decibels. An 
ordinary conversation would increase the read- 
ing to 70 decibels. The sound intensity of an air- 
raid siren could reach about 150 decibels, a jet- 
airplane noise, around 120 decibels When 
sound intensity is doubled, its level increases by 
about three decibels. Loudness levels, which are 
somewhat subjective in that they depend upon 
the judgment of the listener, are measured in 
units called sones and phons.

follows a determination by a judge or jury that 
the defendant is not guilty of the charge on 
which he was tried After the accused has been 
acquitted he may not lawfully be prosecuted a 
second time for the same act Such a prosecu- 
tion would place the accused in double jeop- 
ardy of losing his life, liberty, or property in vio-

double jeopardy normally extends to any prose-

using a weapon to commit murder he may not 
thereafter be tried for having committed an as- 
sault on his alleged victim If a trial is terminated 
because of procedural defect, however, the de-

ACROPOLIS (Gr akros, ^'highest'', po//s, 
"city"'), »n Greek antiquity, name originally ap- 
plied to any fortified natural stronghold or cita- 
del Primarily a place of refuge, the typical 
acropolis was constructed on a hill or eminence 
rising precipitously from the surrounding re- 
gion Because of the protection thus afforded, 
the area adjacent to the base of the hill fre- 
quently became the site of a city Many of the 
cities of ancient Greece developed m this fash- 
ion, and their acropolises, including the Acroco- 
nnth at Corinth (q y ), the Cadmea at Thebes, 
and the Larissa at Argos, are among the most 
celebrated structures of antiquity 
Lower defense walls were erected in certain 
cities, with the result that the acropolises, no 
longer useful as military bastions, were utilized 
for other purposes, notably as sites for temples 
and public buildings The citadel of ancient 
Athens is traditionally referred to as "'the Acrop- 
olis" Built on a limestone hill about 500 ft high. 
It dominates the city and houses the remains of 
some of the finest extant examples of classical 
architecture Included are remains of the Par- 
thenon (q.v ), a Doric temple that is considered 
a model of architectural excellence, the Pro- 
pylaea, a monumental marble gateway on the 
west and the principal entrance to the Acropo- 
lis, the Erechtheum (q v ), a temple famous for 
perfect detail, and the temple of Athena Nike, 
These masterpieces were built in the Golden 
Age of Athens during the reign of Pericles (q v )

the buildings were gradually restored after the 
Greek monarchy was established in 1833 See

ACTING 


ACTING, art or practice or profession of rep- 
resenting a character other than oneself in the 
presence of an audience, as m a theatrical, mo- 
tion-picture, television, or radio presentation 
The actor may accomplish his representation of 
a character by means of suggestive movement 
and speech and altered physical appearance, to- 
gether with the aid of such theatrical appurten- 
ances as costumes, scenic effects, and proper- 
ties, he may also be capable of achieving the 
desired effect without recourse to any artificial 
aids, by means of a thorough emotional iden- 
tification with the character 

What IS today a highly complicated art, re- 
quiring years of training, has its roots in the sim- 
ple role-playing games of children as well as in 
the more sophisticated rituals common to all 
primitive societies A prehistoric man, reenact- 
ing a successful hunt for his tribe as they gath- 
ered around a communal fire, was, no doubt, 
the first actor In one typical tribal ritual, Austra- 
lian aborigines before the hunt don masks and 
costumes of skin to impersonate hunters track- 
ing an animal The correlation between rites of 
worship and the playing of roles is characteristic 
of early cultures. Perhaps as early as 4000 bc, for 
example, Egyptian priests acted out legends of 
Osins and other gods in their religious ceremo- 
nies 

The Classical Tradition. The first professional 
actors were those of the ancient Greek theater 
The sophisticated theater of Greece in the 5th 
century bc developed from primitive religious 
rites honoring the god Dionysus, m which a 
chorus sang hymns relating the story of the god 
and other mythological heroes Most authorities 
agree that it was the poet Thespis, in the middle 
of the 6th century bc, who introduced the first 
actor into these celebrations. At first this single 
actor spoke to the chorus and impersonated 
characters in the legends in the 5th century bc 
the Greek tragic poet Aeschylus added a second 
actor, making dialogue and conflict possible 
Later Greek dramatists, including Sophocles and 
Euripides, employed a third actor. 

Our knowledge of acting in the tragic theater 
of ancient Greece is derived from contemporary 
accounts, from painting and sculpture, from the 
extant manuscripts of three authors (Aeschylus, 
Sophocles, and Euripides), and from the rums of 
the theaters themselves. A great deal of what 
has been written about Greek acting is there- 
fore conjectural It is known that the tragic actor 
wore a padded costume, a large mask, a huge 
headdress, and high-soled shpes The ritualistic, 
formal nature of the tragedies required slow and 
dignified movement from the actors if not from 

146 


the chorus The voice of the Greek actor had to 
project, clearly and with considerable emotional 
range, the complicated metric dialogue and 
verse forms of the tragedies The masks worn 
depicted the primary emotion of a character, 
such as sorrow or joy, and also permitted actors 
to play more than one part Because their work 
had religious associations, actors, always men, 
were highly respected Granted a form of diplo- 
matic immunity, they were often employed m 
diplomatic missions between Creek states 
Greek acting had many parallels with the realis- 
tic acting style of the mid-20th century, since 
both were concerned with characterization and 
with the projection of emotion 

The acting in Greek comedy of the 4th cen- 
tury BC was less strictly formalized than tragic 
acting The old-style comedies of Aristophanes, 
many of which are extant, and the new-style 
comedies of Menander, only fragments of 
which remain, were performed in a flamboyant, 
slapstick style Actors depicted gods, heroes, 
and everyday people all in the same vein of cari- 
cature See Drama Creek Drama, Greek Litera- 
ture 

The drama of ancient Rome copied but did 
not improve upon the Greek models Actors be- 
came increasingly concerned with rhetoric and 
surface brilliance and less concerned with lyri- 
cism and true emotion Roman comic play- 
wrights, such as Plautus and Terence, added 
some local color to their adaptations of the 
comedies of Menander An important develop- 
ment was the disappearance of the chorus from 
the Roman drama. Roman actors, many of them 
slaves, were not held m high esteem socially, 
but some of the more successful performers be- 
came wealthy Among these was Quintus Ros- 
cius (d 62 BC), the most famous actor of the 
classical period By 150 ad Roman theater had 
degenerated into circus-like spectacles and 
pantomimes, m which acrobatics were more 
important than acting. In the 6th century a d the 
performances had become so brutal and bawdy 
that the Christian Church took action against 
them, forbidding attendance as well as denying 
the rite of communion to the performers De- 
prived of the opportunity to practice their pro- 
fession, actors for several centuries were re- 
duced to wandering mountebanks, jugglers, and 
acrobats. 

Miracle^ Mystery, and Morality Plays. The 

Church Itself stimulated the rebirth of drama in 
the 10th century From that century comes the 
earliest extant record of a Mass in which what 
could be called a playlet had been inserted A 
four-line dialogue in verse, called a trope, was

city of Pompeii, Italy, shows a scene

added to an Easter Mass depicting the scene of 
the angel and the three Marys at the tomb of 
Christ The four characters were enacted by 
clerics Later the playlets were extended to in- 
clude more clerics describing other incidents 
from the Bible By the beginning of the 13th 
century the process of secularization was well 
under way, and the plays were banned from the 
churches When the transition was made from 
clergy to laity among the performers and from 
Latin to the vernacular in the language of the 
playlets, the plays came to be known as mystery 
plays By the 14th and 15th centuries these mys- 
tery plays had become an accepted part of life. 
Miracle Plays, depicting the lives of saints and 
martyrs not derived from the Bible, were also 
performed. The acting in all these performances 
was of necessity stark, direct, and primitive En- 
thusiastic caricature and horseplay were com- 
mon in both the miracle and mystery plays, as 
performed by the amateur actors of the towns 
Usually presented on movable platforms or 
wagons in the town marketplace, each episode 
of the plays was assigned to a different guild 
(q V ) of artisans, such as the shoemakers or the 
stonemasons Later, allegories called morality 
plays, appeared and were performed on a fixed 
stage, depicting the conflict between good and 
evil, with actors personifying such abstractions 
as obedience, virtue, or gluttony. At the end of 
the Middle Ages, the line between religious and 
secular drama had become difficult to establish, 
as had the line between amateur and profes- 
sional actor See Miracle Play, Morality Play, 
Mystery Play 

New Techniques in the Renaissance. Plays 
that were copies of Greek and Roman tragedies 


were performed at the various Italian courts of 
the Renaissance (q v ) in refined and formal 
style, here the physical theater began to resem- 
ble the picture-frame theater in which most ac- 
tors of today perform But at the same time a 
different kind of acting was seen m the public 
squares, this was the commedia delLarte (q v ) 
Professionalism for actors was firmly rees- 
tablished with the commedia, as organized 
troupes of actors, including women for the first 
time, played familiar stock characters such as 
Harlequip, Columbine, and Pantaloon Freely 
and spontaneously improvising their own 
scenes and dialogue based on suggested plots 
posted backstage before each performance, 
these actors took over the function of the play- 
wright By eliminating the author, encouraging 
improvisation, and presenting professional ac- 
tors formed into troupes, the commedia revolu- 
tionized acting, drama, and the theater 
Developments in the Elizabethan Theater. 
In Elizabethan England acting and the writing of 
plays flourished in the salutary climate of a 
court and populace both of which encouraged 
the drama Actors and playwrights held perma- 
nent jobs and shares in their stage company, 
which was under the protection of a nobleman 
The plays m which the actors appeared were 
written in a formal, flamboyant, rhetorical style, 
and the acting style matched that of the writing 
But William Shakespeare and his company, first 
called the Lord Chamberlain's Men and later the 
King's Men, bitterly criticized and eventually 
overcame this bombastic style both in writing 
and in performing. In Shakespeare's tragedy 
Hamlet (1600-01), the title character criticizes 
players of the time who "strutted and bel-

lowed'" and suggests the purpose of acting is 
'"to hold the mirror up to nature" Eliza- 
bethan playwrights often doubled as actors 
Shakespeare himself acted such small roles as 
the ghost in Hamlet Among outstanding Eliza- 
bethan actors were Will Kemp {fl about 1600), 
who played comic roles, and Richard Burbage, 
leading man of Shakespeare's company and a 
great tragic actor Many theatrical conventions 
persisted m spite of the reforms instituted by 
Shakespeare- young boys acted women's roles, 
contemporary wigs and costumes were worn re- 
gardless of the period of the play being enacted, 
a minimum of scenery was used and dialogue 
had to describe the locale It was these Eliza- 
bethans, together with the actors and authors of 
the concurrent golden age of Spanish drama, 
who paved the way for the more lifelike drama 
of the future See Spanish Literature, Renais- 
sance and Golden Age 

Neoclassic Styles. The neoclassic period in 
art, music, and literature in England and on the 
Continent, with its slavish devotion to the pom- 
pous recreation of classic modes without classic 
inspiration, had its influence upon the stage 
Writers of serious drama, such as the English 
John Dryden and the French jean Baptiste Ra- 
cine, strictly adhered to what they considered 
the rules of Greek tragedy, requiring that the ac- 
tion of each play take place in a single location 
and within a few hours' time Their plays re- 
quired acting that was also strict and formal 
The speaking of the verse, the gestures, and the 
movement were artificial and entirely presen- 
tational, directed to the audience rather than 
to the other actors In England, women began to 
appear on the professional stage for the first 
time, as the lively roofless playhouses of the 
Elizabethan era became formal indoor enclo- 
sures with painted scenery and artificial lighting 
The Contributions of Moliere. Between 1658 
and 1673 the great French playwright Moli^re 
established comedy alongside tragedy as a the- 
atrical art in France. After touring the provinces 
m farces similar to the Italian commedta 
delTarte, Moliere transformed the stock comme- 
dia caricatures into the skillfully delineated 
comic characters of his own satiric plays. An 
example is his L'Avare ("The Miser", 16^), in 
which Moliere himself enacted the leading role 
of Harpagon, this play was based on the com- 
edy Aululana ("The Pot of Gold", 200? Bc) by 
the Roman playwright Plautus. The acting in 
French comedy was far less formal than tragic 
acting, more closely related to the improvised 
Italian performances from which it was derived 
Remnants of the style can still be seen in per- 


formances of the Comedie Fran<;aise (q v,), the 
troupe founded by Moliere himself 
Era of the Great Actor. The 18th-century 
stage in England, in revolt against the narrow 
scope of neoclasstcism and the artificial bril- 
liance of the Restoration (q v ), tended toward 
the sentimental and florid, with vocal pyrotech- 
nics and exaggerated gesture But it was the 
actor, at the expense of the playwright, who at- 
tracted the audience Classic plays were rewrit- 
ten to suit the particular whim of each leading 
actor, new plays were written with a particular 
actor in mind In the first half of the century, 
while the movements and gestures of the actors 
harked back to the high-flown style of the early 
Elizabethans, the speech of the actors became 
either a declamatory monotone or a carefully 
orchestrated artificial melody Then the British 
actor David Garrick, who had made his debut in 
1741, brought a new performing style to the 
English stage He attempted to simplify gesture 
and movement and to make theatrical speech 
conform somewhat more closely to everyday 
speech Garrick, inspired by his teacher Charles 
Macklin (1697?-1797), assembled a brilliant and 
intelligent company in his theater m Drury Lane 
The 18th century also brought forth a great 
wealth of literature dealing with the art of act- 
ing, most often presenting formulas for the de- 
lineation of passion by means of vocal inflection, 
gesture, and stance In France, too, great actors 
such as Michel Baron (1653-1729), Adrienne 
Lecouvreur (1692-1730), Mane Fran^oise Du- 
mesnil (1711—1803), and Francis Joseph Talma 
(1763-1 826) performed with passion and were 
subjected to critical dissection In Italy the corn- 
media delTarte was taken over by and suffered 
from the dominance of playwrights who at- 
tempted to force the improvisational into a lit- 
erary mold; the playwrights, in turn, suffered 
from the dominance of the actors for whom 
they wrote In America, the first significant pro- 
fessional theatrical company, under the man- 
agement of Lewis Hallam (1712-58), opened in 
Williamsburg, Va , in 1752. The Hallam company 
introduced the English acting tradition to the 
colonies as it toured from the Carolinas to New 
England. 

Romantic Tradition. The revolt against the 
strictures of neoclassicism culminated in Ro- 
manticism (q.v). In the theater, this movement 
reached the various countries of Europe at dif- 
ferent times, from the late 18th century until 
deep into the 19th century in France, the poet, 
novelist, and playwright Victor Hugo empha- 
sized the right of the playwright to deal with 
any subject he might choose and to dispense

With the arbitrary neoclassic rules restricting 
time, place, and action As the author found 
new freedom, so did the actor The result was 
an increasingly flamboyant, unrestrained, 
broadly elocutionary style. This style was in- 
dulged in by actors and applauded by audiences 
well into the 20th century 
Era of the Star. The theater prospered and ex- 
panded in the late 19th and early 20th centuries 
At the same time it was dominated by colorful, 
influential, and highly paid performers who 
were called stars Individual actors became box- 
office attractions, drawing audiences by reason 
of their talent, their fame, or their glamor. In the 
United States, interest in the theater was whet- 
ted by visiting British stars such as Edmund 
Kean, Charles Kemble, Fanny Kemble (see under 
Kean, Kemble), and William Charles Macready 
Stars toured from coast to coast, finding appre- 
ciative audiences on the westward-moving 
frontier The growth of cities in the East pro- 
vided further stimulus to the theater and large 
audiences At the same time, American actors 
emerged, many of whom developed into great 
stars Among these were Edwin Forrest, the first 
great native-born actor in America, Charlotte 
Cushman, the first great American actress; 
Edwin Booth, whose restraint and good taste in 
acting Shakespearean roles represented a new 
acting technique, and Joseph Jefferson, who 
gamed stardom in comedy roles 
Throughout the Western world, the social and 
financial status of the actor was improving Ac- 


tors were fully respected citizens, often wealthy 
and socially prominent In 1895 the British actor 
Henry Irving received the first knighthood ever 
conferred upon a member of his profession 
The tradition of the virtuoso performer was 
carried on not only by American favorites such 
as Minnie Maddern Fiske and Maud Adams but 
also by foreign-born great ladies of the theater 
such as the French Sara Bernhardt and the Ital- 
ian Eleanora Duse International headliners 
triumphantly toured Europe and the US, per- 
forming m their native languages These actors 
brought their virtuosity to classic dramas from 
world literature as well as to the increasingly 
sensational melodramas popular throughout the 
period In these plays theatrical effects, stage 
machinery, and pathos and sentimentality were 
more important than logic or verisimilitude 
Realistic Tradition. As opposed to the star 
system, which stressed one individual -actor at 
the expense of all the other actors and of the 
play, there began a movement in Germany, 
under the sponsorship of George II, Duke of 
Saxe-Meiningen (1826-1914), that emphasized 
the equal importance of every member actor m 
the troupe Demonstrating a remarkably strong 
ensemble technique, his troupe toured thirty- 
eight cities between 1874 and 1890 It was seen 
and applauded by Andre Antoine, the French 
director who founded the Theatre Libre in Pans 
m 1887 There he emulated the ensemble efforts 
of the Saxe-Meiningen players in his own pro- 
ductions of the new realistic plays written by

the Scandinavian authors Henrik Ibsen and Au- 
gust Strindberg In a parallel development, act- 
ing styles became more naturalistic and play- 
wrights began to write of everyday people in 
everyday situations 

Of considerable importance and influence 
after 1900 was the work of the Swiss director 
and producer Adolphe Appia (1862-1928) and 
the British set designer and producer Edward 
Gordon Craig, who tried to achieve a uniformly 
artistic standard of excellence in every element 
of theatrical production In their productions 
the work of the designer and the director was as 
important as that of the actor and playwright 

A further contribution toward realism and 
away from artificiality and bombast was made 
by the Moscow Art Theatre The director, Kon- 
stantin Stanislavski, schooled his actors in a rev- 
olutionary approach to acting, he believed that 
an actor could truthfully portray an emotion 
only by recreating that emotion through the 
memory of a similar moment in his own experi- 
ence The results of this method can still be 
seen m performances of the, Moscow Art Thea- 
tre, in Moscow and on thejr infrequent tours, 
especially in plays written by the Russian author 
Anton Chekhov When the company first toured 
the US, in the 1922-23 season, they found 
American actors already moving away from the 
artificial acting so popular in the turn-of-the- 
century melodrama toward a truthful style 
American drama of the period, written by such 
authors as George Edward Kelly (1887-1974), 
Eugene Gladstone O'Neill, and Sidney Coe 
Howard, was also striving toward truthfulness. 

In the 1930's, the Group Theater of New York 
City carried realistic acting, especially in the 
plays of Clifford Odets, even farther toward ev- 
eryday, lifelike behavior Since the 1940's, most 
important modern drama in America and 


abroad has been performed in a style derived 
from that of the Moscow Art and Group 
theatres Called neorealism, this style invokes a 
truth to life that is selective and heightened 
rather than a photographic copy of life itself m 
all Its detail This truth-to-iife tenet is the foun- 
dation upon which most actors build their per- 
formances today, regardless of the type of thea- 
ter or drama in which they may be performing 
New Media and Techniques. The advent of 
motion pictures, radio, and television (qqv) 
significantly affected acting styles Many actors 
from the stage appeared in these new entertain- 
ment media, but new performing techniques 
had to be developed The actor, brought much 
closer to the audience through the lens and the 
microphone, had to adjust his performance ac- 
cordingly In addition, the performance of a mo- 
tion-picture or television actor is largely shaped 
by the work of the director, the cameraman, and 
the editor, much of which is accomplished after 
the actor has completed his own work. 

Since the late 19th century, when directing 
for the theater became a distinct profession, the 
director has gamed more and more power over 
the actor. One result is the continuous increase 
m the use of individuals who are not profes- 
sional actors but who bring an undeniable sense 
of reality to the roles they perform under the 
guidance of a competent director These un- 
trained nonprofessionals have frequently been 
selected to appear in motion-picture and televi- 
sion films, in both major and supporting roles. 
This technique was introduced into the theater 
with the production of The Concept in New 
York City in 1968, in which residents of a reha- 
bilitation center for drug addicts performed 
scenes relative to their own experience

fluenced by a multitude of forces and traditions 
For example, the Group Theatre, active in the 
1930's in New York City, was strongly influenced 
by the writings of Konstantin Stanislavski, as is 
the Actors' Studio of New York City today 
Under the direction of the American director 
and former Group Theatre member Lee Stras- 
berg, professional actors who are members of 
the Actors' Studio perfect their craft through 
procedures stressing psychological motivation, 
individual interpretation, and emotional identif- 
ication with the character being studied These 
principles had also been adopted by the French 
director Michel Saint-Denis (1897-1971), who 
was actiVe in establishing the training programs 
of the school of the Old Vic Theatre (q.v), 
London, and the drama division of The Juilli- 
ard School (q v ), New York City, in addition to 
the National Theatre School of Canada, Mont- 
real Saint-Denis was one of the many 
teachers who advocate improvisation but also 
demand that students be thoroughly grounded 
in the basic techniques of acting These teach- 
ers stress that the basic tools of the actor, his 
body and his voice, must be rigorously disci- 
plined. The student of acting must also learn 
how to continue the classic traditions of acting, 
to adopt a style appropriate to, but not imitative 
of, the period in which a play was written; in 
other words, the actor must be versatile enough 
to perform convincingly the plays of Aeschylus, 
Racine, Shakespeare, and Ibsen as well as the 
works of contemporary playwrights Such train- 
ing can be obtained at professional acting 
schools, as, for instance, the American Academy 
of Dramatic Arts (q v ) in New York City and the 
Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts m London; act- 
ing schools attached to theaters, such as The 
American Shakespeare Theater Academy at 
Stratford, Conn , and the drama or theater 
departments of many universities Also, many 
successful actors and directors have taught 
acting to classes and individuals Among these 
instructors are the Russian-born Michael Che- 
khov (1891-1955), the French mime Etienne De- 
croux (1898- ), the Polish Jerzy Grotowski 

1933- ), the American director Robert Lewis 
(1909- ), and the American actresses Stella Ad- 
ler (1902- ) and Uta Hagen (1919- ) 

The Actor and the Stage. The actor's per- 
formance IS often largely dictated by the kind of 
stage on which he works Contemporary arena 
staging, in which the audience surrounds the 
performers in whole or in part, calls for tech- 
niques different from those of the conventional 
picture-frame stage in which the actor does not 
have such close contact with the audience An- 



jean Renoir (standing), noted writer and director, 
teaches a class in advanced motion-picture direction at 
the University of California at Los Angeles Recent 
years have produced an increasing awareness of the 
important interrelation of direction and acting nbc-tv 

Other trend in contemporary staging, originated 
m France about 1950, usually referred to as the 
theater of the absurd, is characterized by its re- 
jection of conventional dialogue and plot Cos- 
tumes, stage properties, and decor are used 
merely to convey a mood rather than to repre- 
sent a real situation or location The actors, 
speaking lines meant to depict the meaningless- 
ness and confusion of human existence, do not 
portray real people but merely expound the 
philosophical attitudes of the author 
Another contemporary theatrical style com- 
bines elements of arena staging, the absurdist 
theater, and the epic theater techniques (such 
as direct social comment and didactic songs and 
slogans) developed by the German dramatist 
Bertolt Brecht and the German director Erwin

tempting to achieve complete freedom of mind 
and body Frequently the members of the audi- 
ence become participants in the action The ac- 
tion of these performances is usually only sug- 
gested by an outline (as in the traditional 
ISth-century Italian cammed ta dell'arte) and 
rarely fully scripted These performances often 
try to achieve what is called total theater, 
employing film, projected slides, recorded 
music and sounds, and anything else the com- 
pany feels will assist them m creating the de- 
sired theatrical and emotional effect. For this 
kind of performance an actor needs great bodily 
discipline and freedom from conventional men- 
tal and moral attitudes 

Opportunities for the Actor. In Europe, thea- 
ters are often subsidized by national or local 
governments In England and Ireland, as well as 
on the Continent, many repertory theaters, such 
as the Abbey Theater (q v ) of Dublin and the 
Com^die Fran^aise of Pans, the oldest national 
theater in the world, are well established Gov- 
ernment subsidy has long been sought by the 
American theatrical establishment as an urgent 
need So has decentralization of the theater, al- 
though New York City remains the center of 
American theatrical activity During the 1920's 
and 1930's the little-theater movement bur- 
geoned across America, providing experience 
and training on a local level The Cleveland, 
Pittsburgh, and Pasadena playhouses resulted 
from this movement More recently, regional 
theaters have been aided by the American Na- 
tional Theater and Academy (q.v.) and by grants 
from philanthropic foundations, from local and 
State governments, and from the National En- 
dowment for the Arts of the National Founda- 
tion of the Arts and Humanities (q v.) of the 
Federal government Since the early 1%0's pro- 
fessional repertory companies have flourished 
in Minneapolis, Seattle, San Francisco, New 
Haven, and many other American cities. 
Oriental Traditions. A great wealth of theatri- 
cal tradition exists apart from the Western thea- 
ter discussed above. Although Western tradi- 
tions are observed in a majority of theatrical 
productions throughout the world, cultures 
such as the Japanese, Chinese, Indian, and Indo- 
nesian have, in addition, ancient theatrical 
forms combining dance, pantomime, and song. 
These traditional performances are held m ap- 
propriate theaters throughout the Orient. 

Less realistic than Western, Oriental acting is 
characterized by symbolic gesture, abstraction, 
and formality. For more than 2000 years the clas- 
sic Indian theater has presented plays telling 
legends of Hindu gods and heroes and acted 


with fitting dignity. Gestures have symbolic 
meaning one set of movements of hands and 
feet means the actor is climbing a mountain an- 
other that he is mounting his chariot, see San- 
skrit Literature The same is true of the Chinese 
theater, in which the actor walks m a circle to 
indicate a change of locale and the color of the 
mask he wears signifies his character (white for 
wickedness, red for honesty), see Chinese Litera- 
TURE The No actors of Japan also wear masks 
and their movement is also highly stylized and 
symbolic Although the Kabuki actors of japan 
perform in a stylized and symbolic manner, they 
do not wear masks, their faces are painted viv- 
idly to portray character; see Japanese Drama The 
ancient theatrical traditions of Southeast Asia, 
still extant throughout Indonesia, are primarily 
dance forms

ACTINIDE SERIES. See Periodic Law 
ACTINISM (Gr a/ct/s, 'Vay''), term coined 
about 1824 by the British astronomer Sir John 
Frederick William Herschel (q.v.) to describe 
the heating power of sunlight. The term now is 
applied to the property possessed by certain 
wavelengths of light, called actinic rays, of pro- 
ducing chemical changes. Actinic rays range in 
the color spectrum from green to ultraviolet 
Actinism operates to chemically change photo- 
graphic film, and certain pollutants in the air are 
chemically converted by actinic rays, producing 
noxious fumes. The actinic rays of the sun are 
responsible for the tanning of the skin. 
ACTINIUM, radioactive element, with at no, 
89, at.wt. 227, b.p. probably over 3000“ C (5432“ 
F.), mp probably about 1100'" C. (2012“ F), 
sp.gr lOg/ml, and symbol Ac. it was discovered 
in 1899 by the French chemist Andr6 Louis De- 
bierne (1874-1949) The element is found in all 
uranium ores to the extent of 2 parts to every 
10,000,000,000 parts of uranium. Two naturally 
occurring isotopes of actinium are known Ac- 
tmium-227 is a member of the actinium series 
resulting from the radioactive decay of ura- 
nium-235; see Radioactivity It has a half-life 
(q.v.) of 21 7 years. The other naturally occurring 
isotope, actinium-228, is a member of the tho- 
rium series resulting from the decay of thorium- 
232. This isotope, known also as mesothorium-2, 
has a half-life of 6.13 years. No practical use is 
made of either Isotope

ACTINOMYCOSIS, or LUMPY JAW, or BIG 
JAW, infectious disease of horses, cattle, swine, 
and, in rare cases, humans The disease is

caused by any of several species of the fungus 
Actinomyces (see Fungi Medical Fungi) The 
disease is caused in man by A hommis and in 
animals by A bovis The fungus invades de- 
cayed teeth, diseased tonsils, and the soft 
tissues of the mouth It is characterized chiefly 
by abscessed, swollen, and lumpy tissues of the 
jaw The lungs and intestinal tract may also be- 
come infected In humans, the disease is usually 
acquired by handling or chewing straw used by 
infected animals Actinomycosis is treated by 
X-ray therapy, draining the abscessed tissues, 
and administering sulfonamides and antibiotics 
ACTION, m law in England and the United 
States, any civil proceeding in a court of justice 
Formerly, m England, the term was applied 
solely to proceedings m the courts of common 
law In New York and a few other States the 
term is applied also to criminal proceedings, it is 
not applied to such matters as the probate or 
the interpretation of a will. In the action is em- 
braced every step of the judicial procedure from 
the service of the summons to the final judg- 
ment, but not the means subsequently taken for 
enforcing such judgment 
ACTIUM, town of ancient Greece, on the 
promontory of Actium, on the s shore of the en- 
trance to the Ambracian Gulf The promontory 
was the site of an ancient temple to the Greek 
god Apollo (q V ) It was enlarged by Augustus 
(q V ), Emperor of Rome The ruins of the town 
are extant 

ACTIUM, BATTLE OF, in Roman history, de- 
cisive naval battle fought off the promontory of 
Actium (qv) on Sept 2, 31 bc, between the 
Roman fleet of Octavius, later first Emperor of 
Rome as Augustus (q v ), under the command of 
Marcus Vipsanius Agnppa (q v.), and a com- 
bined Roman-Egyptian fleet commanded by 
Marcus Antonius and Cleopatra (qq v ) The bat- 
tle was the culmination of the rivalry between 
Antonius and Octavius for control of the Roman 
world and had been preceded by a long period 
of skirmishing, which included large armies en- 
camped on opposite shores of the Ambracian 
Gulf Against the advice of his generals and re- 
putedly at the behest of Cleopatra, who wanted 
an opportunity to withdraw to Egypt, Antonius 
launched the initial phase of the engagement 
His fleet of approximately 220 heavy craft 
equipped with missile-throwmg devices at- 
tacked at close range. Octavius' fleet of about 
260 light vessels had greater maneuverability 
The outcome of the battle remained in doubt 
until Cleopatra, apparently alarmed by an 
enemy maneuver, ordered the Egyptian contin- 
gent, about sixty vessels, to withdraw Antonius 


attempted to follow, but most of his remaining 
vessels were shortly overtaken and annihilated 
The deserted army subsequently surrendered to 
Octavius. 

ACTIVATED-SLUDGE PROCESS. See Sewage 
Disposal* Sewage Treatment, Biological Treat- 
ment 

ACTIVATION, in chemistry, the treatment of 
a substance in such a way that its action or reac- 
tivity IS thereby improved Charcoal, for exam- 
ple, may be activated by heating it to a high 
temperature Activated charcoal is used to ad- 
sorb toxic gases, remove impurities from sugar 
solutions, and remove unwanted odors or col- 
ors. Silica gel, a colloidal form of silica (see Sili- 
con), and activated alumina, prepared by heat- 
ing alumina hydrates, are useful as catalysts (see 
Catalysis) and dehydrating agents 
An enzyme (q.v ) may be activated by crystal- 
lization in order to make a reaction more effec- 
tive For example, in medicine, crystallized di- 
gestive enzymes are used to increase the 
waning digestive powers of certain patients 
ACT OF GOD, in law, any occurrence not 
caused by human intervention or negligence 
(q.v), such as lightning and floods. In that such 
events are beyond human control, ordinarily no 
person may be held legally responsible for the 
injuries and losses which they may inflict For 
example, a failure to deliver goods at the time 
contracted because unforeseeable floods have 
halted all transportation does not result in liabil- 
ity for legal damages In this context, the ex- 
emption may not apply in the event of seasonal 
inundations such as monsoons Most policies of 
insurance against property damage do not pro- 
vide compensation for the consequences of acts 
of God. All standard fire-insurance policies, 
however, do cover losses from fire caused by 
lightning; by the payment of an additional pre- 
mium, so-called extended coverage is available 
for damage from such hazards as windstorms, 
hail, ice, snow, and falling trees An act of God 
IS sometimes also called by the equivalent 
French term force majeure or the Latin term vis 
major, 

ACT OF UNION, name of four statutes en- 
acted during the history of Great Britain that ac- 
complished the joining of England with Wales 
(1536), England with Scotland (1707), Great Brit- 
ain with Ireland (1800), and the provinces of 
Upper and Lower Canada (1840) in North Amer- 
ica 

Act of Union of 1536. The Act of Union 
passed in 1536 formally united England and 
Wales Signed by King Henry VIII (q v ), the sec- 
ond English monarch to be descended from the

ACT OF UNION 


old Welsh house of Tudor, the act ended centu- 
ries of Welsh rebellion against the English 
Crown By its terms Wales was partitioned into 
counties, each of which was given representa- 
tion in the English Parliament Welshmen were 
guaranteed equality under the English system of 
laws, and English was fixed as the official lan- 
guage of Wales See also Wales History. 

Act of Union of 1707. The Act of Union 
passed by the British Parliament in 1707 united 
the two kingdoms of England and Scotland into 
the Kingdom of Great Britain The act provided 
for Scottish representation in the British Parlia- 
ment in London sixteen from among their ranks 
were named by the Scottish peerage to sit in the 
House of Lords, and forty-five representatives 
were elected by the people to the House of 
Commons The ancient Scottish Parliament was 
thus abolished The Scottish legal, or court, sys- 
tem, however, was retained, as was the Presby- 
terian form of Church government In addition 
the Scots received equal trading rights with Eng- 
land and her overseas empire 
The act was passed during the reign (1702-14) 
of Queen Anne (q v ), the last British sovereign 
from the Scottish house of Stuart In 1701 the 
Act of Settlement had determined that, upon 
Anne's death without children, the Crown 
would pass to the German house of Hannover, 
see Settlement, Act of Discontent with the 1701 
act flourished in Scotland, where the Jacobites 
{q V ) threatened to enthrone an exiled Stuart 
The Act of Union was passed to abort this 
movement and insure the acceptance of the 
British sovereign 

Act of Union of 1800. The Act of Union 
passed in 1800 joined the Kingdom of Great 
Britain and the entire island of Ireland into the 
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland 
The merger followed a fierce but unsuccessful 
rebellion against British rule in Ireland. The Irish 
legislature was abolished, and the Irish were al- 
lowed thirty-two members in the British House 
of Lords and one hundred members m the 
House of Commons. The act also provided for 
the continuation of the Anglican Church as the 
established Church in Ireland

Younger; Ireland The Period of English Suprem-

Act of Union of 1840. The Act of Union 
passed in 1840 by the British Parliament, re- 
united the North American provinces of Upper 
and Lower Canada The two provinces had been 
set up m 1791 in a legislative move precipitated 
by a predominance of British colonists in one 
area and a Roman Catholic, French-speaking 


majority m the other The Act of Union pro- 
vided for their reunion under a single govern- 
ment headed by a royally appointed governor 
The new government included a legislative as- 
sembly, m which representation was equally ap- 
portioned between the former divisions The 
union formed the Province of Canada, and the 
two sections were known as Canada East and 
Canada West

ACTORS AND ARTISTES OF AMERICA, 
ASSOCIATED. See Actors^ Equity Association 
ACTORS' EQUITY ASSOCIATION, known 
popularly as EQUITY, American labor union of 
actors, actresses, singers, and dancers of the 
professional theater It is affiliated with the As- 
sociated Actors and Artistes of America, a com- 
ponent of the American Federation of Labor and 
Congress of Industrial Organizations (q v ) 

The objectives of Equity are the protection of 
the interests of its members through the estab- 
lishment of standard conditions of employment 
m standard contracts for each kind of work car- 
ried out by them as performers, and promotion 
of the welfare of the theater as a cultural and 
recreational institution The governing power of 
Equity resides m its council, a board comprising 
seventy-two persons who are elected by the 
membership and serve without remuneration 
The essential condition for membership in Eq- 
uity IS a contract of employment with a theatri- 
cal producer. In 1969 the total membership of 
Equity was about 16,500. The organization main- 
tains headquarters in New York City 
History. Equity was founded m May, 1913, m 
New York City, by a group of leading actors. The 
aim of the organization was to protect the rights 
of actors in their contractual arrangements with 
theater producers and managers. In order to 
strengthen its bargaining position, Equity be- 
came an affiliate of the American Federation of 
Labor on July 8, 1919, through an international 
union chartered to represent all theatrical per- 
formers, the Associated Actors and Artistes of 
America, The 4 A's, as this A.F L component is 
popularly known, issued the charters of nine, 
since formed into eight, performer unions m all, 
and continues to represent these unions as un- 
ions, rather than the members of the constitu- 
ent unions individually 
Three weeks after its affiliation with the 
A F.L., Equity became involved in a strike against 
the Producing Managers' Association for recog- 
nition as the representative of the actors The 
strike, which originated in New York City and 
spread to eight other cities, closed thirty-seven 
productions and prevented the opening of eight

ACUPUNCTURE 


others The walkout lasted thirty days and re- 
sulted in a victory for Equity During the strike, 
a union of singers and dancers of the profes- 
sional theater was organized under the name 
Chorus Equity, the union was affiliated with Ac- 
tors' Equity until 1955, when the two organiza- 
tions merged 

Originally, the jurisdiction of Equity included 
all actors in the U S entertainment field except 
those appearing in foreign-language produc- 
tions and in vaudeville As motion pictures and 
radio became important media of entertain- 
ment, the Equity members in these fields 
formed their own unions, the Screen Actors 
Guild (1935) and the American Federation of 
Radio Artists (1937), the latter m 1952 became 
the American Federation of Television and 
Radio Artists The Associated Actors and Artistes 
of America represents not only those unions al- 
ready mentioned, but the American Guild of 
Variety Artists, the American Guild of Musical 
Artists, the Hebrew Actors Union, the Italian Ac- 
tors Union, and the Screen Extras Guild, as well 
ACTS OF THE APOSTLES, book of the New 
Testament (see Bible), in the King James Version, 
The Acts of the Apostles It is traditionally as- 
cribed to Saint Luke (q v ), the author of the 
Gospel of Luke (see Luke, Gospel According to 
Saint) and is generally regarded as a sequel to 
that Gospel, although it now appears as a sepa- 
rate book The date of composition of the book 
IS a subject of considerable controversy and 
conjecture Some scholars have placed it any- 
where from 60 to 125 ad, but most recent 
scholarship places the date at some time before 
80 AD 

Acts IS the fullest account of the Apostolic pe- 
riod of Christianity and therefore a valuable 
source both for archeologists and for historians 
of religion It recounts the establishment of the 
Christian Church from the Ascension (q v ) of 
Jesus Christ (q v ) to the imprisonment and re- 
moval to Rome of Saint Paul (q v ) The first part 
of the book tells of the missionary work that 
Saint Peter (q v ) and the other Apostles, in- 
spired by the Holy Spirit (see Holy Ghost), con- 
ducted among the Jews in Jerusalem and Judea 
(qqv) It also tells of the martyrdom of Saint 
Stephen (q v ) and of the conversion of Paul 
The second part (Acts 13-28.31) is mainly an ac- 
count of Paul's missionary efforts among the 
Gentiles in Asia Minor and Greece See Chris- 
tian Church, History of the 
ACTUARY, person who applies the theories 
of probability and statistics (qq v ) and the prin- 
ciples of finance (q v ) to problems oflnsurance, 
pensions, population studies, and related fields 


Mortality tables and probability tables dealing 
with death, accidents, sickness, fires, and indus- 
trial losses as well as natural disasters are deter- 
mined by an actuary On the basis of these 
tables the rates for the various types of insur- 
ance are determined, and the various under- 
writing practices, such as the amount of money 
reserve that is required to settle expected 
claims, are established The basic assumption in 
actuarial science is that the frequency with 
which events occurred m the past may be used 
to predict or measure the probability of their 
occurring in the future, see Insurance 

In addition to serving in the insurance field, 
actuaries are widely employed in various gov- 
ernment agencies that deal with regulating the 
insurance industry and in connection with op- 
erating the social-security, medicare, and pen- 
sion programs The relatively new field of oper- 
ations research employs a large number of 
actuaries The recent development of high- 
speed electronic computers and data processing 
machinery has created many new applications 
of actuarial science 

ACUPUNCTURE, ancient Chinese medical pro- 
cedure involving the insertion and manipulation 
of metal needles of various lengths at more than 
360 points in the human body Acupuncture is 
applied to produce local anesthesia during sur- 
gery (qv), or to relieve pain and internal con- 
gestion in rheumatic and other physiological 
disorders, see Anesthesia, Physiology, Rheumatic 
Fever The procedure is widely used today in 
most hospitals in the People's Republic of China 
and by some private practitioners in Japan 
History. Although the technique is generally 
acknowledged to date back to at least 1500 8C, 
the history of acupuncture is not well docu- 
mented The procedure was based on the an- 
cient Chinese theory which held that 'Vital en- 
ergy" flowed along a number of invisible 
meridians in the human body and any interrup- 
tion or changes in the flow caused various ail- 
ments The insertion and twirling of needles, 
also called needling, was thought to restore the 
flow and thus the health of the patient 
Treatment. Acupuncture needles, now made 
of steel, are inserted at specific acupuncture 
points some distance away from the part to be 
treated, and are used basically to treat various 
physiological problems, such as appendicitis, ar- 
thritis, asthma, epilepsy, or migraine (qq v ), or 
to relieve postoperative pain Nonphysiological 
problems, such" as bone fractures and cataracts, 
cannot be treated by this method. 

Using acupuncture, complex brain, heart, and 
abdominal surgery is successfully carried out

ADA 


today in China, with the patient fully awake and 
showing no signs of pain or shock The mecha- 
nism by which the insertion of needles acts to 
inhibit pain is a subject of controversy Earlier 
opinion that the phenomenon works by having 
merely a psychological or autosuggestive effect 
has been disproved by both Chinese and West- 
ern scientists who successfully produced anes- 
thetic effects in animals by means of acupunc- 
ture After the discovery in 1975 of enkephalins 
and endorphins, natural pain inhibitors in the 
body, a number of neurophysiologists suggested 
that twirling of acupuncture needles or electri- 
cal stimulation through them may trigger the re- 
lease of one or more of these substances, which 
act to inhibit pain signals by blocking their 
pathway through the spinal cord (see Cell, Ner- 
vous System). 

Acupuncture produces hour-long anesthesia 
after 20 to 30 minutes of stimulation Its effect 
can be reversed by naloxone, an antiopiate

forty years among the Indians, chiefly the 
Chickasaw (q v ), in the region now comprising 
the southeastern United States His book The 
History of the American Indians (1775), al- 
though It insists on the Jewish origin of the In- 
dian race, is one of the best firsthand accounts 
of the habits and character of the Indian tribes 
of the region The work contains an incomplete 
but valuable vocabulary of various Indian di-

Unpopular with the Bohemians because he at- 
tempted to convert them to Christianity, he 
withdrew to Rome, but returned to Prague at 
the request of Pope John XV (see under John) 
He became a missionary m northern Germany 
and Poland and, during the course of his mis- 
sionary activities, was murdered by a pagan 
priest He is known as the '"Apostle of the Prus- 
sians'", his feast is April 23 
ADAM, Adolphe Charles (1803-56), French 
composer, born in Pans Although originally in- 


terested in a scientific career, he entered the 
Pans Conservatory in 1817 and studied music 
composition under the French composer Fran- 
<;ois Adrien Boieldieu (1775-1834) In 1829 
Adam's one-act opera Pierre et Catherine was 
successfully produced, fifty-two more works 
followed, of which one of the most famous was 
the ballet Giselle (1841) His music is distin- 
guished by Its daintiness and finish He was 
made professor of musical composition at the 
conservatory in 1849 His autobiography was 
published in 1860 

ADAM, Robert (1728-92), British architect 
and furniture designer, born in Kirkcaldy, Scot- 
land, and educated at the University of Edin- 
burgh and in Rome, Italy. While in Italy he made 
detailed drawings and studies of the remains of 
the private palace of the Roman emperor Dio- 
cletian (q V ), which he later collected in The 
Rums ot the Palace of Diocletian (1764) From 
1762 to 1768 Adam served as architect to George 
III (qv), King of England, from 1769 to 1771, 
Adam designed an entire section of London, 
known as Adelphi, as a single architectural unit 
Much of his work, including Adelphi, was done 
in collaboration with his less-celebrated broth- 
ers John, James, and William. James Adam 
served as Robert's assistant and succeeded him 
as architect to the king 
The architecture of the Adam brothers is no- 
table for harmony of design and proportion and 
for a prevailing feeling of lightness and spa- 
ciousness, Even more important than their ar- 
chitectural contributions, however, was their 
conviction that the interior decoration of a 
building, as well as its plan and construction, is 
a proper concern of the architect. They de- 
signed much of the furniture for many of the 
town and country homes they created Adam 
furniture, distinguished by grace, lightness, and 
simplicity, IS important in the history of furni- 
ture design and is still admired, see Furniture 
Idth-Century England. In the decoration of fur- 
niture and interiors, the Adam name is particu- 
larly associated with motifs derived from 
wreaths, ancient vases, the honeysuckle plant, 
and fans. i 

ADAM AND EVE^ In the Old Testament, and 
m the tradition of the Jewish, Christian, and 
Muslim religions, the first man and woman, the 
progenitors of the human race The name Adam 
IS related to adamah, the Hebrew word for 
''earth", and is used In the Bible both as a 
proper noun to designate the first man and a 
common noun to designate man in general, or 
all mankind. The name Eva or Eve {hawwah) is 


156 



related to the Hebrew hayyah ("the living 
one'X she received the name because she was 
the "mother of all living" (Gen 3.20) 

The Old Testament book of Genesis contains 
two accounts of the creation of Adam In the 
first version (Gen 1 26-32), the universe is 
created in six days and mankind is created on 
the sixth day Man is made in the image of God 
and IS given dominion over all the plants and 
animals of the earth In the second version 
(Gen 2 7-25), man is created from the dust of 
the earth and is placed as a caretaker in a gar- 
den situated in Eden (q v ) and planted with all 
varieties of trees Man is permitted to eat the 
fruit of all the trees except one, the "tree of the 
knowledge of good and evil", the fruit of which 
he may not eat, under penalty of death From 
one of his ribs, woman is made to be a helpmate 
to Adam 

Through the serpent, who assures Eve that she 
and Adam will not die, the woman is beguiled 
into eating the fruit of the forbidden tree and 
inducing Adam to eat it also The first conse- 
quence of their act is that they realize they are 
naked, and they make "aprons" of fig leaves to 
clothe themselves Called to account by God for 
their disobedience, Adam pleads in extenuation 
that the woman gave him the fruit, and Eve 
pleads that the serpent lured her into it Ail 
three are punished by God, the serpent by be- 
coming the most cursed of the animals, Eve by 
increased troubles and pain, particularly in 
childbearing, and Adam by being forced to se- 
cure his food through the sweat of his brow, till- 
ing the soil until he returns to the dust from 
which he was made. God makes garments for 
the pair from the skins of animals He banishes 
them from Eden, placing cherubim (see Cherub) 
with flaming swords to prevent them from re- 
turning and eating the fruit of the tree of life, 
which confers immortality (Gen 3) 

Two sons, Cam and Abel (qqv), are born to 
the pair, and in his 130th year Adam begets Seth 
Adam dies at the age of 930 years, after having 
fathered sons and daughters (Gen 4, 5*1-5) See 
Genesis 

In the Jewish rabbinical lore, Adam was origi- 
nally a gigantic being, reaching from earth to 
heaven God removed a portion of every limb 
while Adam was sleeping Thus Adam lost his 
vast stature, but remained perfect in every part 
According to medieval Jewish lore, the first wife 
of Adam was Lilith (q v ), who deserted him 
after a quarrel. In a Midrashic version of the 
story of Adam, his extraordinary qualities ex- 
cited envy among the angels, and the angel

has Its counterpart in the mythologies of many 
peoples, see, for example, Creation Epic, Babylo-

(q v ), in 1265 Adam is noted for two works, Le 
Jeu de la Feudlee ("The Game of the Foliage", 
about 1262), a prose drama that is commonly 
considered the earliest comedy in French, and

was appointed minister to Great Britain by Pres- 
ident Abraham Lincoln (qv). His skillful han- 
dling of this position during the American Civil 
War (1861-65), when the British government 
rendered aid to the Confederacy, is an out- 
standing chapter in the history of American di- 
plomacy (see Civil War, the American) In the so- 
called Trent Affair, the first major crisis in 


Anglo-American relations during the war, his 
calm and tact were instrumental in averting hos-

ADAMS 


vard, Adams traveled for two years in Germany 
and Italy From 1860 to 1868 he was private sec- 
retary to his father He then decided to become 
a teacher, and from 1869 to 1876 was assistant 
professor of history at Harvard, where he intro- 
duced the seminar system of instruction. During 
part of that period he also edited the periodical 
North American Review After 1885 he devoted 
himself almost entirely to historical research 
and writing Adams traveled extensively in Eu- 
rope, spending considerable time m France 
His most impressive achievement as a histo- 
rian IS A history of the United States of America 
during the Administrations of Thomas Jefferson 
and James Madison (9 vol., 1889-91), in which 
Adams contends that the decisions and policies 
of the period from 1801 to 1817 shaped the mam 
course of subsequent American political devel- 
opment Among his other writings are two 
biographies. The Life of Albert Gallatin (1879) 
and John Randolph (1882) He wrote two novels. 
Democracy (1880), a political satire, and Esther 
(1884), a story about New York City society 
His The Degradation of the Democratic 
Dogma (1919) includes three essays on his phi- 
losophy of history In this work Adams intro- 
duced his dynamic theory of history Derived 
from the second law of thermodynamics (q,v ), 
the theory maintains that mechanical energy is 
in a constant state of dissipation Human history 
IS similarly devoid of purpose and consists 
merely of a succession of energy phases An- 
other major contribution to the philosophy of 
history is found m the privately printed Mont- 
Saint-Michel and Chartres (1904), a sensitive 
and penetrating discussion of medieval culture 
In his most widely read book. The Education of 
Henry Adams (1906; posthumous Pulitzer Prize, 
1919), he discusses the fundamental character of 
the history of Western civilization The book is 
an autobiography written in the third person 
with detached skepticism and delicate irony. 
One of Adams' mam concerns in the work is to 
indict the formal educational system of his day 
for Its failure to prepare an intelligent man for 
the chaos of modern life 
Adams' works reveal a profound concern with 
the destiny of the modern world His prose style 
IS forceful, as is his treatment of ideas Although 
he thought of his privately published books as 
unsatisfactory achievements, the judgment of 
later critics places them among the important 
works of the 20th century 
Brooks Adams (1848-1927), American histo- 
rian, youngest son of Charles Francis (1807-86),

reer as a writer His first important work. The 
Emancipation of Massachusetts (1887), is a pen- 
etrating analysis of the religious and political 
forces that shaped the development of that col- 
ony In The Law of Civilization and Decay (1895) 
he propounded an economic interpretation of 
history based on the factors governing the rise 
and fall of commerce Adams applied the inter- 
pretation to his own times in America's Eco- 
nomic Supremacy (1901) and The New Empire 
(1902) Hts other writings include The Theory of 
Social Revolutions (1913), a brilliant, though 
pessimistic, study of the American democratic 
system

served for three years (1785-88) as the first 
United States minister to the Court of Saint 
James in London, see Saint James's Palace As 
Vice-President under George Washington (q v) 
he was active in developing Senate procedures 
and cast the deciding vote in several important 
cases 

The election of 1796 ushered in a tumultuous 
period in American politics, both domestic and 
foreign. Two distinct political groups had devel- 
oped the Federalist Party (q v ), led by Alexan- 
der Hamilton (q v ), and the Republicans, later 
known as Democratic-Republicans (see Demo- 
cratic Party), led by Thomas Jefferson (q v ) 
Hamilton, whose controversial policies as secre- 
tary of the treasury under Washington had al- 
ienated much of the electorate, was obliged to 
stand aside when a caucus of Federalists chose 
Adams and Thomas Pinckney (1750-1828) of 
South Carolina as their candidates to oppose 
the Republican nominees, Jefferson and Aaron 
Burr (q v ) During the campaign Hamilton, real- 
izing that he would have little influence on 
Adams, plotted to throw the election to Pinck- 
ney, a maneuver that weakened the Federalists 
and caused Adams to distrust Hamilton Under 
rules of the Constitution in effect at that time, 
each elector voted for two men for President, 
the candidate who won the most votes become 
President and the candidate with the next high- 
est number became Vice-President By a vote of 
71 to 68 the Federalist Adams won over the 
Republican Jefferson, who thus became Vice- 
President 

At the beginning of his term Adams at- 
tempted to negotiate a settlement of differ- 
ences between the U S and France, see XYZ Af- 
fair When the negotiations failed. Congress ap- 
propriated funds to establish a department of 
the navy and to raise an army of 10,CXX) volun- 
teers An undeclared war at sea resulted in

heavy losses on both sides Peace was obtained 
in 1800 after Adams sent a special commission 
to Pans The President's popularity declined, 
however, as a result of the Alien and Sedition 
Acts (q V ), which had been passed in 1798 in an 
attempt to suppress criticism of the administra- 
tion Adams was also handicapped by the antag- 
onism of the Hamilton faction of the Federalist 
Party, and the election of 1800 resulted m a vic- 
tory for the Republicans Jefferson and Burr 
Adams subsequently lived and wrote in retire- 
ment at his Massachusetts home He died on

President of the United States, eldest son of

companied his father to Europe, where he con- 
tinued his education and broadened his inter- 
ests On returning to America he graduated 
from Harvard College, and after three years of 
study in a Newburyport law office, he set up his 
own practice in Boston 
Adams entered public service in 1794, when 
President George Washington (q v ) appointed 
him minister to the Netherlands Three years 
later his father designated him minister to 
Prussia, Adams resigned from this post when 
Thomas Jefferson (q v ) became President in 
1801 In 1803 Adams, a member of the Federalist 
Party (q v ), was elected United States Senator 
from Massachusetts Finding himself opposed to 
the program of his party, he resigned his seat in 
1808 In the following year President James 
Madison (q v ) appointed him minister to 
Russia, where he arranged several trade agree- 
ments In 1814 Adams helped to draw up the 
Treaty of Ghent (see Ghent, Treaty of), after 
which he represented the US in London As 
secretary of state under President James Monroe 
(q.v ), Adams negotiated the treaty by which the 
U S obtained East and West Florida in return for 
renouncing its claims to Texas. He also con- 
vinced the President that the U S should make 
clear its opposition to any European coloniza- 
tion or interference m the New World This 
principle became the basis of the Monroe Doc- 
trine (q v), which was promulgated in 1823 
During the campaign of 1824, Adams ran for 
President against Senator Henry Clay (q v ) of 
Kentucky, and Senator Andrew Jackson (q v ) of 
Tennessee The election was submitted to the 
House of Representatives, and Clay threw his

bargain" had been made between the two can- 
didates Adams and Clay formed an intersec- 
tional party known as the National Republicans 
and Jackson's followers came to be called Dem- 
ocrats, see Democratic Party

As chief executive, Adams frequently allowed 
political opponents to remain in appointive po- 
sitions, and sometimes even chose Jackson's 
men to fill vacancies He refused to sign a treaty 
by which the Creek Indians surrendered their 
holdings in Georgia, because he believed that 
the treaty was obtained by fraud. He actively 
supported the construction of roads and canals 
at national expense, the development of west- 
ern lands, and the exploration of the Pacific 
Northwest coast These programs aroused con- 
siderable opposition throughout the southern 
States, however, and in the election of 1828 
Adams was decisively defeated by Jackson. He 
was elected to the House of Representatives 
from Massachusetts and served in the House 
from 1831 until his death in 1848 A vigorous op- 
ponent of slavery and the Mexican War (qq v ), 
Adams led the fight against the so-called gag 
rules (qv), by which antislavery petitions had

After leaving college in 1740, he was success- 
ively a law student, a clerk in a countinghouse, 
and a merchant His business failed, and he later 
became a partner with his father in a brewery. 
This enterprise also failed after his father died 
Meanwhile, he had been active in Boston politi- 
cal circles In 1756 he was elected tax collector 
of Boston, a position he held for eight years. His 
outspoken opposition to strict enforcement of 
the Sugar and Molasses Act (q.v.) m 1764 
brought him into prominence in colonial poli- 
tics In 1765, in the course of the controversy 
aroused by the Stamp Act (q.v.), he drafted the 
instructions to the Boston representatives in the 
General Court, the legislative body of Massa- 
chusetts He was elected to the lower house of 
the General Court in the same year. The radical 
majority in the lower house elected him clerk in 
1766, and in thrs position, which he held until 
1774, he gradually assumed leadership of the 
movement in Massachusetts that advocated in- 
dependence from Great Britain. 

Adams decisively influenced every important 
aspect of the prerevolutionary struggle against 
British rule. In the realm of practical politics, he 
promoted the formation of the Boston chapter 
of the Sons of Liberty (q.v.) and sponsored the 
Committee of Correspondence of Boston (see 
Committees of Correspondence) He led the fight 
against the Townshend Acts (q.v,), headed the 
demonstrations that led to the Boston Massacre 
(qv,), directed the Boston Tea Party (qv), and 
figured significantly in other outstanding events 
of the period He rapidly acquired an intercolo- 
nial reputation both through these activities and 
as a literary agitator and revolutionary ideolo- 
gist. Many of his writings, chiefly political pam- 
phlets, were widely circulated and read A pro- 
ponent of the natural rights of man (see Natural

cans who challenged the authority of the British 
Parliament and championed rebellion Stylisti- 
cally, his writings are lucid, forceful, and epi- 
grammatic Adams' contributions to the Ga- 
zette, a Boston newspaper, constituted a 
voluminous phase of his agitational work Fre- 
quently written under pseudonyms, his newspa- 
per articles inveighed against reconciliation 
with the mother country, they won many con- 
verts for the radical cause and generally deep- 
ened the mood for revolutionary action

gleton Copley (1737-1815) Museum of Fine Arts, Boston 


In June, 1774, following the passage of the 
Boston Port Act (q v ), Adams climaxed his ac- 
tivities against that and similarly oppressive 
measures by securing the approval by the Mas- 
sachusetts General Court of a resolution to send 
representatives to the first Continental Congress 
(q V ) Elected a delegate to the Congress he 
soon became the leader of the radical faction 
that demanded strong measures against Great 
Britain Adams was a central figure in the epi- 
sode that precipitated the American Revolution 
(q v ) On April 18, 1775, his arrest and that of his 
colleague, John Hancock (q v ), were ordered by 
General Thomas Cage (q*v ), the royal governor 
of Massachusetts The first pitched battle of the 
Revolution occurred when, on the following 
day, British regulars, en route to Adams' tempo- 
rary home in Lexington, Mass, met the armed 
resistance of local patriots (see Concord, Battle 
OF, Lexington) 


Adams was a delegate to the second Conti- 
nental Congress, which convened at Philadel- 
phia, Pa, m May, 1775, and he subsequently 
signed the Declaration of Independence (q v ) 
He remained a member of the Continental Con- 
gress until Its dissolution (1781), but he was fre- 
quently at odds with his colleagues on matters 
of national policy Because his strenuous oppo- 
sition to a strong national government impeded 
mobilization of the nation for a speedy victory 
over Great Britain, his popularity and effective- 
ness as a leader gradually waned In 1779 Adams 
was a member of the committee that drafted 
the Massachusetts State constitution, and he 
was instrumental also in securing the ratifica- 
tion by Massachusetts of the Constitution of the 
United States (qv) in 1788 He was lieutenant 
governor of Massachusetts from 1789 to 1793 
and governor from 1794 to 1797.

tant part in the muckraking movement, an at- 
tempt to expose the corruption in business and 
politics His most notable disclosure was a series 
of articles on the evils of the patent-medicine 
industry, which appeared in the periodical Col-

(after his expulsion from Paradise), during 
which he stood on one foot for a thousand 
years To Buddhists the footlike depression is 
the sacred footmark left by Buddha on his de- 
parture from Ceylon, the Hindus claim it is the 
footprint of their god Siva 
ADANA or SEYHAN^ city in Turkey, and capi- 
tal of Adana Province, on the Seyhan R, about 
240 miles se of Ankara and 30 mi inland from 
the Mediterranean Sea It is the fourth-largest 
city in Turkey Adana is the marketing and dis- 
tribution center for an agricultural region pro- 
ducing cotton, wheat, barley, grapes, citrus 
fruits, olives, and tobacco The chief industries 
of the city are textile manufacturing, tanning, 
and the processing of wool and various foods 
Local points of interest include a great stone 
bridge, built in part during the reign (6th cen- 
tury) of the Byzantine emperor Justinian I (q.v ), 
and the rums of a castle dating from 782. 

Adana was founded in 63 bc by the Roman 
statesman Pompey the Great (see under Pom- 
PEius). For several centuries thereafter it was a 
way station on a Roman military road leading to 
the East The city declined m importance after 
the fall of the Roman Empire (736 ad) but was 
rebuilt m the 8th century by Harun al-Raschid 
(q.v.). Caliph of Baghdad Adana was held by 
Egypt from 1832 to 1840, when it was restored to 
Turkish rule Pop (1970 est ) 351,655.

ADAPTATION, special structure or behavior 
of a living organism that makes it better able to 
survive in a particular environment Adaptation 
IS considered to be an ecological phenomenon 
(see Ecology), one of the many interrelation- 
ships between an organism and its environ- 
ment Adaptation involves adjusting to broad 
environmental factors, such as climate and food 
supply, as well as making use of specialized fea- 
tures that enable the organism to take advan- 
tage of conditions peculiar to its environment. 
Adaptation of a species persists through the ev- 
olutionary process of natural selection (qv); 
characteristics that give a species an advantage 
in coping with its environment favor the species 
for survival over species that are less well 



The walkmgstick so closely resembles the twigs on 
which it rests that it is usually not noticed 

National Audubon Society 


adapted In a sense the environment "'selects'' 
for survival those organisms that best meet the 
challenges of the environment, see Evolution 
Climate and Food Supply. All living organ- 
isms must adjust to climatic conditions or be- 
come extinct. The phenomenon of hibernation 
(q.v) permits many animals to sharply reduce 
their normal food and heat requirements during 
the winter, when food supplies are low Such 
animals also adapt to cold weather with extra 
layers of fat and thicker fur During winter in 
the Temperate Zones, deciduous trees and 
shrubs lose their leaves, and buds are covered 
by bud scales, thereby preserving delicate 
tissues from direct exposure to freezing temper- 
atures. Bulbous plants may be said to show a 
sort of hibernation; the green leaves are shed, 
and the plant lives on food materials stored in 
scale leaves in the bulb. 

Competition among animals for food and 
among plants for light reveals many adaptations. 
For example, vmelike plants survive in dense 
forests because their natural pattern of growth 
allows them to grow rapidly toward the availa- 
ble sunlight. Some animals have become 
adapted to special types of food, which reduces 
competition with other animals The anteater 
(q.v.), for example, feeds on ants and other 
small Insects, and its mouth parts and stomach

ADAPTATION 


are especially suited to this diet In contrast, cat- 
tle live wholly on plants, and their teeth and 
stomachs are adapted to a diet heavy in cellu- 
lose, which many other animals, including hu- 
mans, cannot digest 

Mimicry. Many plants and animals have 
evolved so that they resemble organisms that 
are ordinarily shunned or not noticed by preda- 
tors Birds do not prey on butterflies of the 
genus Danaus because of their repellent taste 
and odor, a number of other butterflies, how- 
ever, have developed color patterns like that of 
Danaus and are likewise disregarded by preda- 
tors The praying mantises, the walkingsticks, 
and some other insects so closely resemble 
twigs that predators often overlook them In a 
similar way, the wings of the lappet moth re- 
semble leaves m color and venation In the des- 
erts of South Africa grow "'living stones", plants 
of the genus Lithops, which have fleshy leaves 
that closely resemble the stones among which 
they grow They escape the notice of desert ani- 
mals that would otherwise eat them 
Protective Coloration. Like mimicry, protec- 
tive coloration helps animals avoid notice Their 
colors and patterns simulate those of the envi- 
ronment to such an extent that they constitute a 
type of camouflage (qv) Arctic animals, such 
as the polar bear and snowy owl, are perpetually 
white like the snow and ice around them In 
northern countries where snow falls in winter 
but not throughout the year, certain animals 
change color with the seasons The arctic fox 
and the ermine are examples of such adapta- 
tion, their fur is white in winter and dark in 
summer 

In addition, changes in color may evolve in 
accordance with more local conditions Races 
of white mice have evolved in the white sands 
of the Tularosa Basin of New Mexico, whereas 
darker strains inhabit both tawny-colored areas 
of desert and a lava flow near the white sands 
In London, where industry has created sooty 
conditions in the past century, species of moths 
with dark-grey wings have developed from 
light-wmged moths that live in country areas 
The sooty-colored wings of the London moths 
harmonize with the grimy color of tree trunks 
and buildings This phenomenon has been 
called industrial melanism. 

Seed Dispersal. Plants have evolved remark- 
able mechanical devices for distributing seeds 
by means of wind, water, and animals In mus- 
tard and the California poppy, the seed capsules 
burst open and, like catapults, hurl seeds con- 
siderable distances. The downy tuft of the dan- 
delion acts like a parachute, allowing seeds of 


the plants to float on the wind to new locations 
The seeds of certain plants that grow on islands, 
such as the beach morning glory, are distributed 
by floating across the water 
Animals transport seeds in many ways Seeds 
of cocklebur, bur clover, horehound, and bur 
mangold are contained in capsules that bear 
tiny hooks or barbs These barbs catch on the 
hair of animals and later the capsules fall off the 
animals at another place Similarly, animals that 
eat berries and other fruits swallow the seeds 
along with the flesh and eliminate the seeds at 
other locations 

Pollination. Seed plants are pollinated in 
three ways by water, by wind, and by animals 
In water pollination, pollen-bearing organs 
break off the male plants and are carried by 
tides or currents through the water to the fe- 
male plants in wind pollination the anthers of 
male flowers open on dry days and release vast 
quantities of pollen Showers of pollen can be 
seen to fall from pine trees on such days 
Animal pollination of flowers is carried on 
mostly by insects and birds When animals visit 
the flowers to secure nectar, pollen, or both, ad- 
aptations of the flower structure ensure that the 
animal carries pollen away with it The pollen is 

The salsify, or oyster plant, is one of the plants the 
seeds of which are dispersed by wind

ADAPTATION 


then deposited in other flowers that the birds or 
insects visit The shape of many flowers, such as 
snapdragons, foxgloves, and sunflowers, is an 
example of adaptation to suit the size and hab- 
its of particular insects The yucca moth (q.v ) 
pollinates the yucca flower in which she lays 
her eggs, later, the moth larvae eat a few of the 
seeds in the pod Hummingbirds (q v ) pollinate 
long, tubular, brightly colored flowers, such as 
those of the trumpet vine See Honeybee Polli- 
nation 

Symbiosis. Pollination may be considered a 
process in which animals and plants have 
adapted to each other Many other symbiotic ar- 
rangements, relationships that benefit both the 
plant and the animal, have developed One 
example of such adaptation is the South Ameri- 
can ant tree (Tnplaris), biting ants inhabit cavi- 
ties in the stem and thorns of the plant and pro- 
tect It from other animals The plant, in turn, 
offers shelter to the ants Other examples of 
symbiotic adaptation are lichens (qv), and ni- 
trogen-fixing bacteria that live in the roots of le- 
gumes (see Nitrogen Fixation, Saprophyte)

Both sexes have graceful, ringed horns, wound 
in an open spiral as long as 43 in Well adapted 
to the desert, the addax has large hooves for 
running over sand By eating succulent leaves 
and wild watermelons it can survive without

ADDER/ name that has been widely applied 
to a number of snakes, both venomous and 
harmless, but that most frequently refers to 
snakes of the genus V/pera, or a single species 
within that genus, V berus, the common adder 
These snakes belong to the family Viperidae, the 
true vipers, see Viper They are characterized by 
flattened, triangular heads, widened at the rear 
to accommodate large venom glands, and long, 
curved fangs that are folded against the roof of 
the mouth when not in use 
The common adder is less dangerous than 
many other venomous snakes, although the bite 
may prove fatal to human beings It feeds 
chiefly on small rodents and seldom grows 
longer than 2 ft It varies in color from gray, 
green or brown to velvety black, and on all but 
the darkest specimens a regular series of zigzag 
black marks may be distinguished on the back 
The wide range of the common adder extends 
east across Europe and Asia to the island of Sa- 


khalin m the Pacific Ocean, south to Spam, and 
north beyond the Arctic Circle, farther north 
than any other species of venomous snake It is 
the only venomous snake in Great Britain An- 
other European variety, the Orsini viper, V. ursh 
nu macrops, lives largely on insects and appears 
to use Its venom apparatus rarely, even when 
picked up in the hands At the other extreme are 
the daboia, or Russel Ts viper, V. russellii, of 
southeastern Asia, which probably has caused 
more human fatalities than any other species of 
viperine snake, and the asp (qv), V aspis, of 
southern Europe 

In Africa larger snakes of different genera in 
the Viperidae family, notably the puff adder 
(q V ), Bitis anetans, are generally called adders 
The African Cape viper, B, inornata, sometimes 
IS called night adder because of its habit of 
prowling for food at night The Cape viper and 
the Berg adder, B. atropos, are closely related to 
the puff adder although both are smaller m size 
and not as widely distributed as the puff adder. 
No snakes of the viper family are found in Aus- 
tralia or in the Western Hemisphere One ser- 
pent found in Australia, however, is the death 
adder (q v ), Acanthophis antarcticus, a member 
of the family Elapidae, commonly known as 
cobra (q v ), resembling closely the true vipers, 
having the same triangular head and long poi- 
son fangs In the United States several harmless

ADDISON, loseph, pen name CLIO (1672- 
1719), English essayist, poet, and statesman, 
born in Milston, Wiltshire, and educated at 
Queen's and Magdalen colleges. University of 
Oxford At Oxford Addison was known for his 
skill m writing Latin verse In 1699 he was 
granted a government pension, which he used 
for travel to France, Italy, Switzerland, Austria, 
and Germany, writing and preparing himself for 
a diplomatic career His most notable literary 
work of this period was a poem, "The Letter", 
addressed to one of his patrons, Charles Mon- 
tagu, 1st Earl of Halifax (see under Halifax) In 
1704, about a year after his return to England, 
Addison was commissioned by the government 
to write a poem celebrating the British victory at 
the Battle of Blenheim (see Blenheim, Battle of) 
His composition "The Campaign", which was 
favorably received, was such an aid to the Whig 
Party (q v ) that soon afterward he was ap- 
pointed a commissioner of appeals 
His position in both politics and letters was 
now firmly established In 1706 he was ap- 
pointed undersecretary of state, and in 1709, 
secretary to the lord lieutenant of Ireland, 
meanwhile, in 1708, he had entered Parliament 
as a Whig, and he retained his seat for the re- 
mainder of his life. In 1709 Addison became a 
contributor to The Taller, a periodical founded 
by his friend the English essayist Sir Richard 
Steele. Two years later, Steele founded another, 
more popular periodical, The Spectator, for 
which Addison subsequently wrote the finest of 
his many essays For additional information 
about these periodicals, see Essay, Steele, Sir 
Richard Addison's literary reputation reached 
Its highest point in 1713, when his tragedy Cato 
was produced in London. In the opinion of 
most modern critics, this play, an artificial and 
undramatic work, was overestimated by Addi- 
son's contemporaries, ft was translated into sev- 
eral European languages, and such influential 
critics as the French author Voltaire (qv.) pro- 
nounced It the finest tragedy in the English lan- 
guage. in 1717 he became secretary of state, in 
ill health, he resigned the office in 1718 
Addison's literary reputation has suffered a 
decline since his own time, when he was widely 
considered the most important of English au-

the founders of the modern familiar essay, as a 
prose stylist of polish, grace, and elegance, and

Addison's poetry is now generally read only as a

ADDISON'S DISEASE, chronic disorder re- 
sulting from insufficiency of the adrenal glands 
The disease was first described by the British 
physician Thomas Addison (1793-1860) m 1855 
The cortex, or outer portion, of the adrenal 
gland secretes hormones that have a vital effect 
on food metabolism, salt and water balance, 
and, to a lesser extent, on the reproductive sys- 
tem, The insufficiency can occur after a severe 
infection such as tuberculosis, or after massive 
bleeding of the adrenals, or surgery affecting 
the glands, such as removal of a tumor The re- 
sulting lack of hormone secretion causes such 
symptoms as weakness and fatigability, weight 
loss, low blood pressure, gastrointestinal dis- 
tress, low blood sugar, depression and irritabil- 
ity, and increased skin pigmentation A form of 
pernicious anemia may result from the gastroin- 
testinal disturbances of Addison's disease Once 
inevitably fatal, the disease is now treated with 
daily doses of cortisone or hydrocortisone and 
the use of additional salt in the diet of the vic- 
tim See Adrenal Gland, Cortisone Hormones

To find the sum of any two numbers between 1 
and 9, locate the first of the numbers in the ver- 
tical column at the left of the table and the 
other number in the horizontal row at the top of 
the table The sum is the number in the body of 
the table at the intersection of the particular 
row and column 

The method for adding several large numbers 
(that IS, numbers greater than 10), such as 
237 + 128 + 17, IS to arrange them in a vertical 
array with the coefficients (see Arithmetic) of 
corresponding powers of ten in the same col- 
umn 


237 « 2X10*4“ 3X1014- 7 
928 = 9 X 10*4 2 X 1014 8 
16 «= 4 1 X 10^ 4 6 

The numbers to be added are called summands 
or addends, and the result of the addition is 
called the sum or total Beginning with the ex- 
treme right-hand column, or the unit column, 
the sum of these coefficients is obtained either 
from repeated use of the table above or from 
memory In the example, this sum is 21, or 
2 X 10"^ 4 1 X 10° The 1 IS written m the units 
column below the answer line, and the 2 (which 
stands for 2 x 10 or 20) is placed in the tens col- 
umn. The technique of adjusting those coeffi- 
cients greater than 9 is commonly referred to as 
carrying 

The example now appears thus

Repeating this procedure, the sum of the entries 
in the tens column is obtained. In the example, 
this sum IS 8, which stands for 8x10 This num- 
ber IS placed under the answer line in the tens 
column In this case, there is nothing to carry 


169 


ADDRESS, FORMS OF 


This IS indicated by a zero in the hundreds col- 
umn Had the sum of the numbers in the tens 
column been 38, however, the 8 would be 
placed as before under the answer line in the 
tens column, and the 3 placed in the hundreds 
or 10^ column 

This process is repeated until the left-hand 
column has been added and the sum placed in 
this column under the answer line, as in the fol- 
lowing example

This method can be used no matter how large 
the addends or how many of them are involved 
It should be noted that members of different 
classes cannot be added to give a sum in one of 
those classes In the example 3 -h 4 = 7, the 3 
stands for three objects which are denoted by 
the letter that is 3x, and if the 4 stands for 
four of the same objects, that is 4x, then the sum 
or total of seven stands for lx If, however, the 
three stands for 3x and the four for 4y, then the 
total IS 3x -h 4y because groups of different 
classes cannot be added together, see Algebra 
Two classes (apples and oranges), however, can 
be added to give a sum in another class (fruit)

mal fractions is illustrated in the following

until It became a Roman colony in 24 bc It fell 
successively under Ethiopian and Persian con- 
trol and became associated with Yemen about 
the 7th century ad It fell to the Turks in 1538 
and was incorporated into the sultanate of Lahej 
in 1728 After British forces seized the city in 
1839 It was administered as part of India until it 
became a crown colony in 1937 Meanwhile, it 
was declared a free port in 1850, and coastal 
areas were annexed to the port in 1882 and 1888 
During World War II the colony of Aden was an 
important Allied air base 
In 1956 tension arose between Yemen and 
Great Britain over the Aden Protectorate terri- 
tory (see South Arabia, Federation of) Trade- 
union and nationalist elements in the colony 
generally sided with Yemen, and strikes and 
riots resulted from British efforts to deal with 
border clashes by force These groups also op- 
posed an announcement by the British govern- 
ment on Aug 20, 1962, of a plan to merge the 
colony with the Federation of South Arabia, but 
the merger was effected in January, 1%3 In sub- 
sequent years Aden was the focus of terrorist at- 
tacks by Arab nationalists attempting to expel 
the British from South Arabia When the federa- 
tion gained its independence on Nov 30, 1967, 
Aden became part of the new state, now named 
the Peoples Democratic Republic of Yemen.

ADENAUER, Konrad (1876-1967), German 
political leader, born in Cologne, and educated 
at the universities of Freiburg, Munich, and 
Bonn From 1917 to 1933 he was lord mayor of 
Cologne and a member of the Prussian legisla- 
ture Soon after the National Socialist govern- 
ment came to power in 1933, he was barred 
from public office, forced into retirement, and 
twice imprisoned (1934 and 1944) in concentra- 
tion camps (see National Socialism) At the end 
of World War il he rose to leadership of the 
Christian Democratic Union. He was chairman 
in 1948 of the convention empowered to draft a 
provisional constitution for West Germany In 
September, 1949, following the establishment of 
the Federal Republic of Germany, he was 
elected chancellor, he served continuously in 
that post until October, 1%3, when he resigned.

ADENOIDS, lymphoid tissue at the back of 
the throat, which usually shrinks and disappears 
by adolescence Enlargement of this tissue, 
however, is fairly common in children and may 
interfere with breathing Symptoms of enlarged 
adenoids include a nasal voice, persistent 
breathing through the mouth, snoring, and rest- 
less sleeping Adenoid sufferers may experience 
general listlessness and poor appetite The en-

ADHESION 


larged tissue becomes infected easily, causing 
respiratory illnesses such as laryngitis and bron- 
chitis (q V ) The treatment most often recom- 
mended in such cases is surgical removal of the 
adenoid tissue 

ADHESION, attraction between the surfaces 
of two bodies The term sometimes is used to 
denote the tendency of two adjacent surfaces, 
which may be of different chemical composi- 
tion, to cling to each other, whereas cohesion is 
used to refer to the attraction between portions 
of a single body For example, if a sheet of glass 
IS lowered into water and withdrawn, some 
water will cling to the glass (adhesion) but the 
rest will be pulled back into the mam body of 
water (cohesion) 

The force of attraction is attributed to elec- 
tromagnetic interactions produced by fluctua- 
tions in the distribution of electrons in the mol- 
ecules of the facing surfaces. The distance be- 
tween the molecules of the facing surfaces is a 
determining factor in the amount of force ex- 
erted A surface which may appear smooth to 
the naked eye actually may be too rough to hold 
Its molecules close enough to a facing surface 
to produce an electromagnetic bond 

Cleanliness of the surfaces, temperature, and 
the pressure applied to the bodies also affect 
adhesive qualities Two smooth, clean pieces of 
soft aluminum can be hammered together But 
if the clean surfaces are touched by the fingers, 
adhesion will not occur between the pieces of 
metal Gauge blocks, pieces of metal used for 
taking accurate measurements, have such ex- 
tremely smooth surfaces that their facing sur- 
faces can be made to stick to each other by 
twisting them together 

In the human body, when tissues or organs 
that are normally separated unite or grow to- 
gether, the process is called adhesion. This ab- 
normal occurrence may come about m the heal- 
ing process after a surgical operation or take 
place as a result of an inflammation An example 
IS the adhesion of lung tissue to the chest wall 
following pleurisy 

ADHESIVE, substance used to bond two or 
more surfaces together. Most adhesives pro- 
duce a bond by filling in the pits or valleys m 
the normally rough surfaces. The effectiveness 
depends upon the surface tension of the adhe- 
sive, softness, rate of shrinkage, and other fac- 
tors Surface tension determines how far the ad- 
hesive penetrates the tiny depressions in the 
surfaces Strains may develop as the adhesive 
shrinks while drying Surfaces tend gradually to 
slip over each other if the adhesive remains soft 
Adhesives are of organic or inorganic origin,

composed of protein materials, gums, starches 
cellulose, natural and synthetic resins, rubbe/ 
and mineral products, such as sodium silicate 
(water glass) Of increasing commercial impor- 
tance are the epoxy resins, which contain short 
chains of molecules of carbon and oxygen 
atoms When treated with a curing agent, the 
short molecules form long chains, or polymers 
The long chains, though microscopic, become 
very strong ropes and nets, linking surfaces in a 
firm bond Epoxy resins have been used to hold 
together high-tension metallic parts of super- 
sonic aircraft, thereby eliminating the need for 
rivets 

ADIGE, river of n Italy It rises m Rhaetian 
Alps, flows E as far as Bolzano, and then courses 
in a generally s direction through Trento and 
Verona Beyond Verona it flows toward the se

lower course is wide, but the swift current 
makes navigation difficult In ancient times the

ADIRONDACK MOUNTAINS or ADIRON- 
DACKS, group of mountains m ne New York 
State, bounded by the Canadian border on the 
N , the Mohawk R Valley on the s, the Saint Law- 
rence R and Black R valleys on the w and the 
Lake Champlain area on the e The mountains lie 
chiefly m Clinton, Essex, Hamilton, and Franklin 
counties. The Adirondacks are composed 
mainly of metamorphic and igneous rock, 
among the oldest in the world (see Precambrian 
Era) Sometimes erroneously included in the 
Appalachian system (see Appalachian Moun- 
tains), the Adirondacks are geologically related 
to the Canadian Shield (q v ) and are generally 
considered a s. extension of it About one half of 
the total acreage of the Adirondack Mt range is 
part of the New York State Forest Preserve Over 
2,400,000 acres of forest preserve land have been 
incorporated into Adirondack Park (created in 
1892), where particular conservation and recrea- 
tion efforts have been focused. The park, which 
has a total area of 516,000,000 acres (3,200,000 
acres m private holdings), occupies the central 
portion of the mountain range and is magnifi- 
cently scenic. In the park is Mt. Marcy (5344 ft), 
the highest summit in the State, as well as forty- 
five other peaks more than 4000 ft high, among 
them Algonquin Peak (5114 ft.) and Skylight, 
Haystack, and Whiteface peaks The region has 
hundreds of large and small lakes, notably lakes 
Placid and George, and Schroon, Cranberry, 
Upper and Lower Saranac, and Raquette lakes.

thickly forested with spruce, pme, and hemlock, 
and with some types of deciduous tree Wildlife 
IS abundant, although some of the larger species

ADJECTIVE, word that modifies or qualifies a 
noun or pronoun (qq v.) The six kinds of adjec- 
tives are common, participial, pronominal, nu- 
meral, proper, and compound 

(1) A common adjective is any word that de- 
scribes a noun, as in the phrases '"a gooo^ horse", 
"a strong horse", "the eastern shore", "the inner 
gate" 

(2) A participial adjective is the present parti- 
ciple of a verb used to describe a noun, as "an 
amusing story", "a startling event" 

(3) Pronominal adjectives include demon- 
strative adjectives {"this book", "that book"), 
possessive adjectives {"his book", "the/r book"); 
indefinite adjectives {"any book", "some 
book"), and interrogative adjectives {"Which 
book?", "What book?") 

(4) A numeral adjective is a number used as 
an adjective, as in "one book", "seven books", 
"the fifth chapter". 

(5) A proper adjective is an adjective formed 
from a proper name, as m "Chinese art", 
"Shakespearean actor" 

(6) A compound adjective is one in the at- 
tributive position (see below) consisting of two 
or more hyphenated words, as in "nut-brown 
maiden", "hard-to-read book" 

An adjective that modifies a noun directly, as 
m "the strong man", "an amusing story", "his 
book", IS called an attributive adjective An ad- 
jective that follows a copulative verb (see Verb), 
as in "the man is strong', "the bread tastes 
good", "the story was his", is called a predicate 
adjective 

Adjectives express three degrees of compari- 
son positive {"strong", "beautiful"), compara- 
tive {"stronger", "more beautiful"), and superla- 
tive {"strongest", "most beautiful'^. 

In many European and various other lan- 
guages, the form (spelling) of the adjective 
varies to correspond to the number and gender 


of the noun or pronoun it modifies, for exam- 
ple, in French, "une femme agee", "un homme 
age", "deux femmes agees" In English, how- 
ever, the adjective does not change its form in 
any case M P 

ADJUTANT, common name for storks of the 
genus Leptoptilos, found in southern Asia and 
the East Indies (see Stork) L argala is about 5 ft 
tali and is found in the East Indies It is chiefly 
white, but its back and wings are slate-colored, 
and Its head and neck are bare and flesh-col- 
ored, marked with black From the front of its 
neck hangs a long pouch, which is connected 
with Its respiratory system and possibly serves as 
an air reservoir The adjutant is voracious, and 
Its diet consists of fish, reptiles, carrion, and 
offal It is an efficient scavenger, and since it 
also eats many of the smaller noxious animals, it 
IS protected by law in India. The largest species 
of adjutant, L dubius, is about 7 ft. tall and is 
found m India and southeastern Asia. A smaller 
species, L javanicus, is native to the East Indies 
A closely allied species, the marabou (q.v ), in- 
habits Africa The long feathers found on the 
undersides of the tails and wings of all three 
species are known as marabou when used for 
trimming ladies' clothing and accessories

ADLER, CYRUS 


Adler left the orthodox psychoanalytic school to 
found a neo-Freudian school of psychoanalysis 
After 1926 he was often a visiting professor at 
Columbia University, and in 1935 Adler and his 
family moved to the United States. In his analy- 
sis of individual development, he stressed the 
sense of inferiority, rather than sexual drives, as 
the motivating force in human life According to 
Adler, conscious or subconscious feelings of in- 
feriority (to which he gave the name inferiority 
complex), combined with compensatory de- 
fense mechanisms, are the basic causes of psy- 
chopathological behavior The function of the 
psychoanalyst is to discover and rationalize 
such feelings and to break down the compensa- 
tory, neurotic will to power that they engender 
in the patient, see Nietzsche, Friedrich Wilhelm 
For a more detailed discussion of Adler's 
theories, see Psychoanalysis* Psychoanalytic 
Schools Alfred Adler Adler's works include The 
Theory and Practice of Individual Psychology 
(1918) and The Pattern of Life (1930),

ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, body of law appli- 
cable to the operations of agencies established 
by the legislature to carry out the functions of 
the executive branch of government The Inter- 
state Commerce Commission and the Federal 
Communications Commission (qq v ) are exam- 
ples of such agencies In the United States and 
Great Britain the courts did not generally apply 
a distinctive body of law to such agencies until 
about the beginning of the 20th century On the 
European continent, however, the courts had 
earlier recognized a separate administrative law, 
which was often known by the French term 
droit administratif. Administrative law in the 
U S IS basically concerned with whether proper 
standards are applied by administrative agen- 
cies in exercising their powers and in making 
and enforcing regulations If an agency does not 
apply the proper standards its failure may be re- 
dressed by application to the courts. Although a 
court may not substitute its own judgment for 
that of the agency m determining whether a 
given regulation is desirable, the court may de- 
clare the regulation a nullity if the agency, by 
promulgating such a regulation, has exceeded 
the authority conferred by the legislature In de-

termining that a regulation has been violated, 
substantial proof is required, but the agency is 
not bound by the laws of evidence that apply in 
court trials 

With the multiplication of Federal administra- 
tive agencies m the U S during the 1930's, a 
means of making administrative regulations rea- 
sonably accessible to the public became neces- 
sary The Federal Register Act, enacted m 1935, 
provides that all Federal regulations must be 
published in the Federal Register, a regulation 
that IS not published in this manner is not bind- 
ing upon persons who are unaware of its exist- 
ence At periodic intervals all Federal regula- 
tions still in force must be codified and 
published in a compilation called the Code of 
Federal Regulations The Administrative Proce- 
dures Act, which was enacted in 1946, provides 
that before a Federal agency promulgates a gen- 
eral regulation interested parties must be af- 
forded an opportunity to present their views 
Another safeguard is that the investigation and 
prosecution of alleged violations may not be 
undertaken by the same persons who will ren- 
der the adjudication 

ADMINISTRATOR, in law in the United 
States, the person appointed by a surrogate's 
court (q V ) to administer the estate of a person 
who dies intestate or leaves a will (q v ) that fails 
to appoint an executor (q v ) 

ADMIRAL (Ar amir al, "lord of the"), in com- 
mon usage, a naval officer of the highest rank 
In the United States Navy the rank includes four 
grades, namely, fleet admiral, admiral, vice- 
admiral, and rear admiral, m descending order 
of seniority 

Before the American Civil War, the highest 
rank m the US Navy was that of commodore In 
1862 the rank of rear admiral was created and 
bestowed on Captain David G Farragut (q v ) 
Congress also established the ranks of vice-ad- 
miral and admiral for Farragut m 1864 and 1866, 
respectively The rank of admiral of the navy 
was created for the American naval officer 
George Dewey (q.v ) in 1899, on his death the 
rank was abolished Between 1899 and 1915 the 
ranks of admiral and vice-admiral were also 
temporarily abolished During World War II the 
rank of fleet admiral was created, it was first be- 
stowed upon William Daniel Leahy (q v ), on 
Dec 15, 1944. Within a year it was also be- 
stowed on Ernest Joseph King, Chester William 
Nimitz, and William Frederick Halsey (qq v ) 
No fleet admirals have been created since 
World War II 

The rank of admiral is held by the chief of 
naval operations and the commanders in chief 


of the U S , Atlantic, and Pacific fleets The chief 
of the Bureau of Naval Personnel holds the rank 
of vice-admiral, and the chiefs of all other naval 
bureaus hold the rank of rear admiral If the offi- 
cers chosen to fill those posts do not already 
hold the appropriate rank, it is bestowed on 
them, at least temporarily The rank of admiral 
can be conferred by Congress as a mark of 
honor 

A system of gradations in the rank of admiral 
prevails in all major navies of the world In the 
British navy, except for the substitution of the 
title admiral of the fleet for that of fleet admiral, 
the grades are identical to those of the U S 
Navy 

ADMiRALTY 1. In government, the depart- 
ment having control over naval matters The Ad- 
miralty Board in Great Britain, established in the 
early 18th century, manages affairs similar to 
that of the Department of the Navy in the 
United States 2. In law, special court exercising 
jurisdiction over all maritime issues See Mari-

ADMIRALTY ISLANDS or ADMIRALTIES, 

group of islands m the w Pacific Ocean, sit- 
uated to the N of New Guinea, and compris- 
ing, m political geography, the Manus District 
of the Australian Territory of New Guinea (see 
New Guinea, Territory of) The Admiralty 
Islands, which form part of the Bismarck Ar- 
chipelago (q V ), consist of about eighteen 
islands Manus Island (area, 600 sq mi ) and 
Rambutyo Island (area, about 80 sq mi ) are 
the only large islands of the group Coconut 
growing and pearl fishing are the leading in- 
dustries The town of Lorengau, situated at 
the E extremity of Manus Island, is the admin- 
istrative center The Admiralties were an- 
nexed by Germany in 1885 In 1920, following 
the defeat of Germany in World War 1, the 
group was mandated to Australia. Japanese 
forces occupied the islands in 1942, during 
World War II Early m 1944 an Allied task force 
ipvaded the group Japanese resistance ended

ADOBE, Spanish-American name applied to a 
sun-dried brick and to the clay soil from which 
the brick is made Adobe soils are found in the 
and and semiarid southwestern portions of the 
United States and in Mexico Composed of a 
very fine mixture of quartz, clay, and other min- 
erals, they exhibit great plasticity when moist 
but when dry are so coherent that tillage is al- 
most impossible The soils cover thousands of

ADOLESCENCE 


square miles m the western U S and under irri- 
gation are very fertile, yielding undiminished 
yearly harvests of grains, alfalfa, and other crops 
Combined with straw, adobe soils are molded 
into bricks which are baked in the sun for from 
seven to fourteen days Because of the lack of 
cohesiveness when wet, adobe bricks can be 
employed only in regions of limited rainfall 
Dampness causes deterioration, hence adobe 
structures often have eaves and stone founda- 
tions for protection against moisture Such 
structures are most popularly associated with 
the Pueblo Indians (q v ), who built cliff dwell- 
ings and also ovens of adobe Remains of their 
mud-brick communal villages still stand after 
centuries, and some Pueblos still live in these 
unique apartment houses 
A similar building material was widely used in 
ancient Egypt, Babylonia, and Assyria 
ADOLESCENCE, process of maturation or 
state between childhood and adulthood In 
physiology, the term denotes the period from 
the beginning of puberty (q v ) to maturity, it 
usually lasts from the age of about fourteen to 
about twenty-one in males, and from about 
twelve to about eighteen in females In both 
sexes the period is marked by maturation of the 
reproductive organs and by rapid growth, espe- 
cially in the skeletal and muscular systems and 
in certain vascular tissues Adolescence is gen- 
erally characterized by emotional instability, on 
the one hand, and by emergent emotional and 
mental maturity, on the other, see Child Psy- 
chology In legal usage, the term is frequently 
applied to the period prior to full legal age, see

ADONIS, in Greek mythology, beautiful youth 
beloved by the goddesses Aphrodite and Per- 
sephone (qq V ), He was born of a myrrh tree

ADOPTION, in law in the United States, the 
proceedings by which a child not the lawful 
issue of the adopter is admitted to the legal 
rights and privileges of a son or daughter In the 
social life of the Greeks and the Romans adop- 
tion played an important part, but it was un- 
known to the early law of the Teutonic nations 
Adoption never acquired a place in English law, 
but most States of the U S have permitted it 

The original purpose of adoption was to pre- 
vent the rights of a family from becoming ex- 
tinct through the failure of natural issue In 
Rome, adoption was closely associated with the 
doctrine of paternal power, and assumed two 
forms, adoption in the strict sense, when one in 
the power of a natural ascendant was trans- 
ferred to the power of a third party, and arroga- 
tion, when a person legally his own master gave 
himself into the power of another In the 6th 
century ad, the Byzantine emperor Justinian 1 
(qv) made radical changes in this as m other 
departments of law 

In the U S the regulations governing adop- 
tion vary considerably In some States an order 
of the court is necessary, whereas in others a 
deed of adoption is sufficient In all cases, how- 
ever, the status of the adopted person is sub- 
stantially that of a child born in lawful wedlock 
ADOPTIONISM or ADOPTIANISM, heresy 
akin to Nestonanisrn, originating about the end 
of the 8th century m Spam (see Nestorians) EIi- 
pandus (717-8080, archbishop of Toledo, and 
Felix (750^*^16), bishop of Urgel, held that, 
though Christ was Son of God in respect of His 
divine nature^ as man He was only adopted to 
be the firstborn Son of God. This doctrine gave 
occasion to three synods, at Ratisbon (792), 
Frankfort (794), and Aix-la-Chapelle (799), at 
each of which adoptionism was condemned as 
heresy,

ADRENAL GLAND or SUPRARENAL GLAND, 

vital organ situated, m man, near the upper end 
of each kidney The two parts of the gland, the 
inner portion or medulla and the outer portion 
or cortex, are like separate endocrine organs 
They are composed of different types of tissue 
and perform different functions The adrenal 
medulla, composed of chromaffin, secretes the 
hormone adrenaline (q.v.), also called epineph- 
rine, in response to stimulation of the sympa-

blood circulation The hormones of the medulla 
are called catecholamines Unlike the cortex, 
the medulla can be removed without endan- 
gering the life of an individual 

The adrenal cortex, consisting of mterrenal 
tissue, secretes a number of steroid hormones, 
but only a few are secreted in physiologically 
significant amounts They are the glucocorti- 
coids, known as cortisone and hydrocortisone, 
which affect the metabolism of carbohydrates 
and proteins, a mineralocorticoid, aldosterone, 
which is essential to the sodium balance and 
fluid level of the body, and adrenal sex steroids, 
which have a minor influence on the reproduc- 
tive system Modified glucocorticoids are now 
produced synthetically which are superior to 
naturally secreted steroids for treatment of Ad- 
dison's disease (q v ) and other disorders See 
ACTH, Cortisone, Hormones 
ADRENALINE or EPINEPHRINE, hormone se- 
creted by the medulla of the adrenal gland 
(q v ) The pure compound, first isolated by the 
Japanese chemist jokichi Takamine (1854-1922), 
IS a white or light-brown crystalline powder of 
bitter taste which decomposes when heated to 
about 210° C (410° F) It is 3,4-dihydroxy-a 
(methylaminoethyl) benzyl alcohol QHi 3 No 3 
The chemical, also known by the trade names 
Adrenalin and Suprarenin, formerly was pre- 
pared from beef adrenals but is now made syn- 
thetically 

Adrenaline is not necessary to the mainte- 
nance of life and is normally present m the 
bloodstream in minute quantities, m times of 
excitement or emotional stress, large additional 
quantities are secreted, exerting a marked effect 
on body structures in preparation for physical 
exertion For example, adrenaline stimulates the 
heart, constricts the small blood vessels, raises 
the blood pressure, liberates sugar stored in the 


liver, relaxes certain involuntary muscles and 
contracts others It is widely used as a drug to 
stimulate the heart, prevent bleeding, and to 
counteract allergic conditions such as asthma 
and hives 

The adrenal medulla cells also secrete a sub- 
stance chemically related to adrenaline, called 
noradrenaline, norepinephrine, or levoartere- 
nol The presence of noradrenaline, isolated in 
1946 by the Swedish scientist Uif Svante von 
Euler-Chalpm (q v ), had been suspected for 
nearly fifty years, because secretions of the me- 
dulla did not have the same physiological ef- 
fects as pure adrenaline Noradrenaline is syn- 
thesized by the body from the ammo acid 
phenylalanine and is believed to be the precur- 
sor of the substance from which adrenaline is 
produced In adult humans, the proportion of 
adrenaline is about five times as great as of 
noradrenaline, but in children and persons with 
adrenal tumors the proportion is reversed In 
general the function of noradrenaline seems to 
be the maintenance of normal blood circula- 
tion, the function of adrenaline is to produce 
dramatic changes in circulation during an emer- 
gency For example, noradrenaline constricts 
blood vessels of the brain and skin but to a 
lesser degree than adrenaline

he was called upon by Henry II (q v ), King of 
England, to grant permission for the subjugation 
of Ireland Since the popes claimed the ''islands

in a NW direction, between the e coast of Italy 
and the w coast of Yugoslavia. At the s extrem- 
ity IS the Strait of Otranto, 45 mi, wide, which 
connects it with the Ionian Sea (qv) The Gulf 
of Venice, in the n, and the Gulf of Trieste, in 
the NE, are the principal Adriatic embayments. 
The w coast is comparatively low and has few 
inlets, and the n is marshy and edged with la- 
goons On the E the Albanian coast is steep and 
rocky, and the coast of Yugoslavia is fringed 
with islands The area of the sea is about 60,000

ADSORPTION, the attraction between the 
surface of a solid or liquid, and the atoms, ions 
or molecules of a gas or other liquid Porous or 
finely divided solids can hold more adsorbate 
because of the relatively targe surface area ex- 
posed Similarly, the adsorbent surface of a 
quantity of liquid is increased if the liquid is di- 
vided into fine droplets In some cases, the 
atoms of the adsorbate share electrons 'with 
atoms of the adsorbent surface, forming a thin 
layer of chemical compound Absorption (qv) 
occurs when the molecules of adsorbate pene- 
trate the bulk of the solid or liquid adsorbent

ADULT EDUCATION. See Education, Adult 
ADULT EDUCATION ASSOCIATION OF THE 
U.S.A., organization dedicated to advancing 
"the concept of education as a process continu- 
ing throughout life" It was founded in 1951, ab- 
sorbing the American Association for Adult Edu- 
cation, which was originated m 1926 by the 
Carnegie Corporation of New York (qv) The 
membership is made up of interested individu- 
als, professionals in the field of adult education, 
organizations, and institutions. The organization 
encourages local, State, and regional adult-edu- 
cation efforts through twenty-two State and 
three regional associations. The activities of the 
association include an annual conference; an 
information-clearinghouse and consultation 
service; research studies, and special projects, 
such as a study of adult education in Latin 
America for the Agency for International De- 
velopment, a federal-government agency The 
association publishes a monthly magazine, a 
quarterly journal, a newsletter, books, and pam- 
phlets Headquarters are in Washington, DC 
ADULTERATION, act of making any com- 
modity impure by admixture of other or baser 
ingredients. This admixture may corrupt the na- 
ture of the original base to the extent of de- 
stroying its identity or it may merely lower the 
value or efficacy of the finished product. The 
object of adulteration is usually pecuniary profit 
for the manufacturer, who sells inferior food, 
drugs, and other products to an unwitting pub- 
lic. Such products, misbranded or labeled as of 
standard quality, may constitute a grave menace 
to public health With the advent of pure food 
and drug laws in Michigan (1895), Wisconsin 
(1898), Massachusetts (1902), and Minnesota

ADVENTISM 


(1905), there appeared an awakening of interest 
in the problem of adulteration among consum 
ers in 1906 the Federal government enacted the 
National Pure Food and Drug Act Withm a few 
years of the passage of the Federal statute, ship- 
ping, inspection, and proper branding and la- 
beling laws intended to insure maximum purity 
were adopted by the remaining States State 
laws regulating the production and sale of food 
and drug products within the State widened the 
scope of the Federal law, which could attack the 
problem only through the power of Congress to 
regulate interstate commerce 
The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act of 
June, 1938, further decreased incentive to adul- 
terate and to defraud Penalties were increased, 
loopholes in the previous law were eliminated, 
cosmetics were included among items under 
Federal control, and regulations regarding inter- 
state traffic in, and labeling of, drugs were made 
more stringent In 1939 enforcement of the food 
and drug law, since 1906 under the Department 
of Agriculture, was placed instead under the 
Food and Drug Administration (q v )

ADVENT (Lat advenfus/'the coming"), m the 
Christian ecclesiastical calendar, a season of 
penance observed in preparation for the festival 
of Christmas (q v ) The earliest authentic record 
of Advent (581 a d ) states that the season starts 
on the feast of Saint Martin (q v ), Nov 11, this 
period IS still observed in the Orthodox Church 
(q V ) About 600 Pope Gregory I (see under 
Gregory) decreed that the season should start 
on the fourth Sunday before Christmas, but the 
longer period was observed in England for some 
years The shorter period is now observed in the 
Roman Catholic, Lutheran, Anglican, and Prot- 
estant Episcopal churches, and the first Sunday 
of Advent is regarded as the commencement of 
the Christian ecclesiastical year, see Church 
Calendar 

ADVENTISM, Christian doctrine that the re- 
turn of Jesus Christ to rule the world is immi- 
nent, and the mam tenet of certain Protestant 
denominations, which thus are referred to as 
Adventist (see Adventist Churches, below) This 
doctrine and its amplifications are derived 
mainly from the prophetic and apocalyptic texts 
of Daniel and Revelation (qq v ), popular inter- 
est in these texts revived spontaneously in both 
Europe and America m the early 19th century 
Most members of Adventist denominations 
hold the premillenarian view that the Second 


Advent (the return of Christ) will precede the 
millennial kingdom of God predicted in Rev 
20 1-6, as opposed to the postmillenarian view 
that the kingdom of God will gradually come 
into being, presumably through social progress, 
and that Christ will appear after the millennium 
(q v ) In the postmillenarian view, the dates of 
the millennium can be known only m retro- 
spect, after Christ's coming, see also Second Ad- 
vent OF Christ 

Adventism received its clearest definition and 
most earnest support in the United States under 
the leadership of William Miller (1782-1849) of 
Low Hampton, N Y , who had become a Baptist 
in 1816 He began preaching Adventist doctrines 
about 1831, and by 1839 he had begun to ac- 
quire a following among both the clergy and lay 
members of various Protestant churches His 
followers, referred to as Millerites by the press, 
took the name Adventists in 1844 

In that period most Christian theologians 
were anticipating the end of the present world 
order with all its evils, but they interpreted the 
end of this world as a spiritual regeneration of 
mankind Miller and his followers, however, be- 
lieved that a fiery conflagration would cleanse 
the earth, destroying all except the righteous, 
who would be miraculously saved Basing his 
computations on Biblical texts. Miller proph- 
esied that the Second Advent would occur be- 
tween March 21, 1843, and March 21, 1844 The 
failure of this prediction was called the First 
Disappointment, and many left the movement 
Following this, a second date was set, Oct 22, 
1844, and of the 50,000 to 100,000 Adventists in 
the U S at that time, many disposed of their 
property in anticipation of the Advent The 
Great Disappointment was recognized on Oct 
23, 1844, the movement was ridiculed in the 
press and elsewhere, and thereafter many Ad- 
ventists lost faith and returned to their former 
churches Those remaining held a conference in 
Albany, N Y , m the spring of 1845, at which they 
organized the American Millennial Association, 
dedicated to the mam Miliente doctrines, in- 
cluding premillenarianism, the return of Christ 
in his own person, the resurrection of the dead, 
and the renewal of the earth as the eternal 
home of the redeemed 

Adventist Churches. The Adventists split into 
four main bodies, which continue to flour- 
ish in the 1970'$ The Seventh-day Adventists 
(see Seventh-Day Adventist Church), by far the 
largest single Adventist group both inside and 
outside the U S trace their origins to the 1840's 
According to recent statistics, there are more 
than 3,800,000 Seventh-day Adventists world-

The Advent Christian Church, first known as 
the Advent Christian Association and then the 
Advent Christian Conference, in 1854 began to 
withdraw gradually from the American Millen- 
nial Association, primarily because of a growing 
dispute over the question of immortality (q v ) 
First organized in 1860 in Salem, Mass, the Ad- 
vent Christian Church preached a doctrine of 
''conditional immortality", according to which 
the dead remain in an unconscious state until 
the resurrection, which would take place at the 
Second Advent (after the millennium) Advent- 
ists also believe that a divine tribunal will deter- 
mine rewards and punishments on the Day of 
judgment, and that the punishment of the 
wicked will be complete extinction, rather than 
eternal suffering in hell The church observes 
the sacraments of baptism by immersion and 
the Lord's Supper (q v ) Although organized 
into regional and central groups (the central 
group IS the Advent Christian General Confer- 
ence of America), each church governs itself in- 
dependently According to recent statistics, 
membership in the U S and Canada neared 
30,000 The church supports missionary work m 
Mexico, Malaysia, Japan, India, and the Philip- 
pines, It founded Aurora College in Aurora, III , 
the Berkshire Christian College in Lenox, Mass , 
and two publishing houses In 1964 the Life and 
Advent Union, founded in 1848, merged with 
the Advent Christian Church, 

The Church of Cod (Abrahamic Faith) devel- 
oped from several smaller groups of similar faith 
(some dating back to 1800), some of them had 
organized in 1888 under the name of Church of 
Cod in Christ jesus The churches, however, did 
not function as a unit until 1921, when a na- 
tional conference was established and the name 
Church of God of the Abrahamic Faith was 
adopted The corporate name is Church of Cod 
General Conference (Oregon, 111 ) Acceptance 
of the Bible as the supreme standard of the faith 
results m a literal interpretation of the Biblical 
references to the kingdom of God, the premil- 
lennial coming of Christ is the central belief 
The members maintain that the dead are merely 
asleep, at the time of the Advent the righteous 
will be resurrected on earth and the wicked will 
be finally destroyed Acceptance of these doc- 
trines, repentance, and purification through 
baptism by immersion are requirements for ad- 
mission to the church The individual churches 
are autonomous and as of 1971 had about 7200 
members in the U.S Missionary work is carried 
on in India, Mexico, and the Philippines. 


The Primitive Advent Church is a recent off- 
shoot of the Advent Christian Church, it has 
about 600 members, all in West Virginia,' and its 
aim IS to recover the principles and thought of 
early Adventism

ADVERB, part of speech used to modify verbs 
("he walked slowly"), adjectives ("a very good 
book"), and other adverbs ("he walked very 
slowly") Modification by an adverb is analo- 
gous to modification by an adjective Adverbs 
are subdivided according to their meaning and 
function into classes indicating (l) place or di- 
rection, as where and whence, (2) time, as ever 
and immediately, (3) degree, as very and almost, 
(4) manner, as thus and wisely, and (5) belief or 
doubt, as perhaps and no Adverbs and adverb- 
ial phrases frequently may express degrees of 
comparison, namely positive, wisely, compara- 
tive, more wisely, and superlative, most wisely 
In English many adverbs are formed from adjec- 
tives by the addition of the suffix -ly, as in wise, 
wisely, in certain other languages, such as 
French, Spanish, Italian, and Portuguese, similar 
suffixes are added Some languages, including 
German and Rumanian, make no distinction in 
form between the adjective and the adverb, see 
Adjective, Grammar Parts of Speech, Verb 
ADVERTISING, collective term for public an- 
nouncements designed to promote the sale of 
specific (ommcTdities or services Advertising is 
salesmanship on a mass basis, employed when 
the use of direct, person-to-person selling is im- 
practical, impossible, or simply inefficient It is 
to be distinguished trom other activities in- 
tended to persuade the public, such as propa- 
ganda (q.v.), publicity, and public relations Ad- 
vertising techniques range m complexity from 
thc^ publishing of simple, straightforward no- 
tices m the classified-advertising columns of 
newspapers to the concerted use of newspa- 
pers, magazines, television, radio, direct mail, 
and other communications media, in the course 
of a single advertising campaign. 

From Its crude beginnings in ancient times, 
advertising has burgeoned into a worldwide in- 
dustry. In the United States in 1972 advertisers 
invested an estimated $22,800,000,000 in adver- 
tising to influence the purchase of commodities 
and services, a 10 percent increase over their 
1971 investment. 

American advertising leads the world, not 
only in volume of business but in the complex- 
ity of its organization and of its procedures For 
these reasons, this article deals primarily with 
advertising in the U.S. Modern advertising is an 


180 



integral segment of urban industrial civilization, 
mirroring contemporary life in its best and 
worst aspects Having proven its force in the 
movement of economic goods and services, an 
increasing proportion of recent advertising has 
been concerned with improving the human 
condition The 1960's in particular were an era 
of social concern in advertising The continuing 
cancer and human-rights campaigns are only 
two examples of the use of the advertising in- 
dustry as a means to promote public welfare 

Advertising falls into two mam categories, 
namely, consumer advertising, directed to the 
ultimate purchaser, and trade advertising, in 
which the appeal is made to dealers and other 
middlemen through trade journals and other 
media 

Both consumer and trade advertising employ 
many specialized types of commercial persua- 
sion A relatively minor, but important, form of 
advertising is institutional advertising, which is 
designed solely to build prestige and public re- 
spect for particular business concerns as impor- 
tant American institutions Each year millions of 
dollars are spent on institutional advertising, 
which usually mentions products or services for 
sale, only incidentally. Another minor, but in- 
creasingly popular, form of advertising is coop- 
erative advertising, in which the manufacturer 
shares the expense of local radio or newspaper 
advertising with the retailer who signs the ad- 
vertisement Occasionally national advertisers 
share the same space in magazine advertising 
For example, makers of pancake flour, of sirup, 
and of sausages sometimes jointly advertise this 
combination as an ideal cold-weather breakfast 

Advertising may be local, national, or interna- 
tional in scope The rates charged for the three 


Advertising on a large scale, making use of neon light- 
ing and huge billboards, has been a continuing feature 
not only of Times Square in New York City but of 
downtown areas throughout the US upi 

different levels of advertising vary sharply, par- 
ticularly in newspapers, special varying rates are 
set also by newspapers for amusement, legal, 
political, financial, religious, and charitable ad- 
vertisements 

Media. The channels or media through which 
advertising messages are disseminated are nu- 
merous and varied In descending order of dol- 
lar volume, the major media in the U S are 
newspapers, television, direct mail, outdoor and 
transit, magazines, radio, and business periodi- 
cals In addition, a significant amount of all U S. 
advertising dollars is invested m dozens of mis- 
cellaneous media, such as window displays, free 
shopping-news publications, calendars, sky- 
writing by airplane, and sandwich boards car- 
ried by men walking streets 

In the U S. a wide range of advertising media 
has been developed from sources the potential 
importance of which was ignored for many 
years Delivery trucks, once plainly painted, 
now carry institutional or product messages, as 
do many shipping cartons Many packages carry 
advertising for products other than those con- 
tained in them, and wrapping paper and carry- 
out bags bearing advertisements are used 
widely by retail stores. 

Newspapers have traditionally led all other 
media in the U S in terms of dollars invested in 
advertising, despite the introduction of the new 
electronic media (radio and television), the 
daily papers have maintained a comfortable 
lead Thus, in 1972 newspapers received about 
23 percent of the advertising investments in the 


ADVERTISING 


nation, totaling $5,400,000,000 from local and 
national advertisers In volume of space used, 
classified advertising, known popularly as want 
ads, amounted to 27 percent of total newspaper 
advertising In second place was television, with 
about 13 percent, or $3,000,000,000 More than 
$2,800,000,000 was invested in direct mail. Radio 
received about $1,300,000,000, and consumer 
magazines received about $1,000,000,000 
Direct Advertising This type of advertising in- 
cludes 'all forms of sales appeals mailed, deliv- 
ered, or exhibited directly to the prospective 
buyer of an advertised product or service, with- 
out use of any indirect medium, such as news- 
papers or television Direct advertising logically 
may be divided into three broad classifications, 
namely direct-mail advertising, mail-order ad- 
vertising, and unmailed direct advertising. 
Direct-Mail Advertising All forms of sales ap- 
peals (except mail-order appeals) that are sent 
through the mails are considered to be direct- 
mail advertising The chief functions of direct- 
mail advertising are toj familiarize prospective 
buyers with a product, its name, its maker, and 
Its merits, and with the product's local distribu- 
tors The direct-mail appeal is designed also to 
support the sales activities of retailers by en- 
couraging the continued patronage of both old 
and new customers 

Mail-Order Advertising When no personal 
salesmanship is involved, other methods are 
needed to induce people to send m orders by 
mail In addition to newspaper, magazine, radio, 
and television, special devices, such as single- 
product folders or multiproduct mammoth cat- 
alogs are used Mail-order promotions are de- 
signed to accomplish a complete selling job 
without the help of salesmen Direct-mail ad- 
vertising helps the salesman, mail-order adver- 
tising replaces him 

Unmailed Direct Advertising Used for the 
same broad purposes as direct-mail advertising, 
It includes all forms of indoor advertising dis- 
plays and all printed sales appeals distributed 
from door to door, handed to customers in retail 
stores, included in packages and bundles of 
merchandise, or conveyed in some other man- 
ner directly to the recipient 
With each medium competing keenly for its 
share of the business, advertising agencies con- 
tinued to develop new techniques for display- 
ing and selling wares and services Among these 
techniques were vastly improved printing and 
reproduction methods in the graphic field, 
adapted to magazine advertisements and to di- 
rect-mail enclosures, the use of color in news- 
paper advertisements and in television, and out- 


door signboards more attractively designed and 
efficiently lighted Some of the most subtly ef- 
fective improvements were suggested by adver- 
tising research 

Research. During the 19th century it was pos- 
sible only to approximate the effectiveness of 
various advertising techniques Prospective ad- 
vertisers were guided almost solely by estimates 
of magazine and newspaper readership in the 
early days of broadcasting and outdoor advertis- 
ing the industry lacked a reliable measure of the 
audience of these media In 1914 the Audit Bu- 
reau of Circulations (ABC), an independent 
organization subscribed to principally by news- 
paper and magazine publishers, was established 
to meet the need for authentic circulation sta- 
tistics and for a coordinated, standardized way 
of presenting them 

Eventually, greater scientific efforts to deter- 
mine relevant facts about audience and reader- 
ship came about as a result of competition 
among the media and the demand among ad- 
vertisers for an accurate means of judging the 
relative effectiveness of the media The media 
soon developed ways of ascertaining not only 
how many people see or hear advertising mes- 
sages, but what kinds of people and where they 
are located Newspapers and magazines, either 
through their own research staffs or through 
specialized organizations employed for a fee, go 
to great lengths to analyze their circulations to 
show where their readers live, their income, ed- 
ucation, recreational habits, age, and number of 
children, and to provide other guides to deter- 
mining their readers' susceptibility to certain 
classes of products 

Radio and television stations and networks 
similarly analyze their audiences for the guid- 
ance of advertisers. In this field, too, broadcast 
companies, advertising agencies, and advertis- 
ers subscribe to one or more audience-research 
organizations to determine how many viewers 
or listeners tune in regional and network shows 
at any given time. Special surveys of local 
broadcast programs can be arranged also. In a 
similar but less comprehensive manner, out- 
door- and transportation-advertising companies 
have set up organizations to tally the numbers 
of persons exposed to their posters 

Because of the nature of advertising, depend- 
ing as It does on psychological factors and other 
variable factors difficult to ascertain precisely, 
the whole field of audience research is complex 
and controversial. Researchers have found it 
necessary to consistently refine their techniques 
and make them increasingly reliable 

One by-product of this widespread interest

in, and dependence upon, advertising and mar- 
keting research is the Advertising Research 
Foundation, sponsored, directed, and subsi- 
dized by advertisers, agencies, and media This 
organization, founded in 1936, not only initiates 
and commissions research projects of its own, 
but also establishes criteria and standards of 
procedure that tend to enhance the authen- 
ticity, reliability, efficiency, and usefulness of all 
advertising and marketing research 
One major type of research project is the sur- 
vey of test markets Advertisers and agencies 
frequently conduct extensive and expensive sur- 
veys to determine the potential acceptance of 
products or services before they are advertised 
nationally at costs that may aggregate millions 
of dollars In one common procedure the adver- 
tising-marketing division of a company dis- 
patches a crew of surveyors to do a door-to- 
door canvass in various neighborhoods differing 
in average-income levels Householders are 
shown various versions of the product intended 
for market If the survey convinces the manufac- 
turer that one of the versions exhibited will at- 
tract enough purchasers, a crew then pretests 
various sales appeals by showing provisional ad- 
vertisements to consumers and asking them to 
indicate their preference After the one or two 
best-liked advertisements or basic appeals are 
determined, the advertiser produces a limited 
quantity of the new product and introduces it in 
one or more test markets. On the basis of this 
market test the advertiser-manufacturer can 
make his final decision as to whether he should 
invest in a national campaign 
The question of what motivates a consumer 
to buy challenges the imagination and ingenuity 
of the seller and presses research specialists for- 
ward into new fields of investigation Motiva- 
tional research, for example, attempts to probe 
the unconscious impulses that motivate buying 
decisions, advertising agencies then utilize 
these findings to influence the consumer and to 
attempt to break down his sales resistance Crit- 
ical observers outside the advertising industry 
assail the motivational approach as unreliable 
and as unfair to the consumer, who should not, 
they feel, be subjected to such indirect sales at- 
tacks On the other hand, many researchers re- 
gard motivational inquiry as nothing new, ex- 
cept that It tends to delve deeper into the 
psychological springs of behavior than did ear- 
lier investigations Through careful questioning 
and investigation it is often possible for an ad- 
vertiser to trace a sale and learn what actually 
motivated the consumer to buy his product. Re- 
searchers report that the purchaser is sometimes 


impelled by factors that he fully understands 
but does not care to discuss Further, he may be 
motivated by influences of which he is not even 
aware Workers m motivational research try to 
explore these influences 
Techniques of Persuasion. While experts 
argue about new methods, they still rely mainly 
on basic appeals that have proved successful 
over the years These appeals offer the hope of 
more money and better jobs, security against 
the hazards of old age and illness, popularity 
and personal prestige, praise from others, more 
comfort, increased enjoyment, social advance- 
ment, improved appearance, and better health 
The modern advertiser stresses not the product 
but the benefits that may be enjoyed by pur- 
chasers of the product Thus, the advertiser pur- 
veys not cosmetics but the expectation of new 
beauty, allure, and hope To attract the prospec- 
tive buyer of automobiles, the manufacturer 
sometimes places less stress on the mechanical 
attributes of his car than on the excitement, 
comfort, and prestige it may bring the buyer 

The techniques of persuasion are many and 
are circumscribed only by the ingenuity of the 
creative mind, by the limits of the various chan- 
nels of communications, by certain legal restric- 
tions, and by standards self-imposed by the ad- 
vertising industry One fundamental technique, 
apparent in the earliest applications of advertis- 
ing and still basic in the most modern proce- 
dures, IS repetition A typical national advertiser 
captures the attention of his prospective cus- 
tomer by repeated appeals to buy It is not un- 
usual for a housewife to get sales talks on her 
radio and television sets in her home, another 
one for the same product in her local newspa- 
per, additional reminders in various national 
magazines, another by outdoor poster or car 
card on her way to market, and still another 
when she enters the store and is confronted 
with an indoor poster, counter card, or display 

Another basic persuader is the trademark 
Manufacturers have spent millions to establish 
their trademarks as symbols of reliability and 
value. A trademark is useless, of course, unless 
the manufacturer sets and maintains high stand- 
ards of quality, but once consumers gam confi- 
dence in it, the owner can use it as a persuader, 
that is, as a device to reassure customers that all 
products bearing this symbol are reliable The 
trademark is especially useful when the manu- 
facturer introduces a new item to his line of 
goods. 

Price appeal probably motivates more de- 
cisions to buy than any other appeal, and the 
magic words ''sale"' and "bargain" are directed

Advertising serves many functions in a free-market so- 
ciety Each of these advertisements has its own way of 
capturing attention, 3nd each has a message The pub- 
Itc-service messages of the American Cancer Society 
and of the Advertising Council use persuasion to edu- 
cate the public and to fight such health hazards as cig- 
arette smoking and drug abuse The messages of the 
commercial advertisers, on the other hand, frankly at- 
tempt to sell their clients' products or services The tel- 
evision commercials for Alka Seltzer (below) employed 
a humorous approach that was rapidly picked up by 
other advertisers and marked many campaigns of the 
early 1970's

mercials, appeals to the sense of smell by the 
use of perfumed ink on paper, endorsements of 
products by celebrities, appeals to parents to 
give their children a better life and future, ap- 
peals to children to "'ask mommy" to buy cer- 
tain breakfast cereals, and the controversial use 
of "scare copy" Because fear is a principal 
human frailty, this last-mentioned motivation is 
applied to the advertising of thousands of com- 
modities, sometimes boldly, sometimes subtly 
Fear of poverty, sickness, and loss of social 
standing, and the specter of possible disasters, 
great and small, sometimes move previously le- 
thargic and unexcitable consumers to buy any- 
thing from insurance and fire extinguishers to 
cosmetics and vitamin capsules 
Structure of the industry. Big-budget adver- 
tising IS a relatively new industry Even in the 
late 1880's there were fewer than a dozen adver- 
tisers spending as much as $100,000 a year The 
advertisers of that period had little need for ad- 
vertising agents The publishers of magazines 
and newspapers, however, often found it diffi- 
cult to sell space in their pages to advertisers, 
and therefore began to commission brokers to 
go out and sell advertising space These so- 
called space brokers were the first advertising 
agents Present-day advertising agencies con- 
tinue to act as space brokers in that they pur- 
chase space and time on behalf of the adver- 
tiser. Their commissions, however, still come 
from the media owners In fact, the commission, 
usually 15 percent, represents a major portion of 
the income of the modern advertising agency 
Increased costs of operation, however, have ob- 
liged many agencies to charge some advertising 
clients service fees when their revenue from 
commissions is inadequate It is generally as- 
sumed that an agency must now have a gross 
profit of 20 percent of its total revenue if it is to 
earn the average industry profit of a little less 
than 2 percent The fee method of agency com- 
pensation has become increasingly important, 
and IS now generally used for such noncom- 
missionable services as research, market analy- 
sis, and public relations 
Time and space buying is only one of the 
principal services rendered by the modern ad- 
vertising agency, although this one department 
has become highly specialized. The agency 
spends most of its time planning, creating, and 
producing the advertising for its clients A typi- 
cal major agency maintains hundreds of execu- 
tives and craftsmen. They include advertising 
and marketing specialists, designers, writers, art- 
ists, economists, psychologists, researchers, 
media analysts, product testers, librarians, ac- 


countants and bookkeepers, and mathemati- 
cians An important group of people, making 
up the traffic department, follow and expedite 
the many pieces of w'ork from start to finish 
until the completed product is delivered on 
time at the end of the creative line 

The growth of radio and television broadcast- 
ing as advertising media necessitated the crea- 
tion of new departments devoted to the pur- 
chase of network- and local-station time, news 
reports, entertainment shows, and other types 
of programs The television-radio staff of the 
agency also supervises the purchase and pro- 
duction of commercial announcements, most of 
which are produced by independent studios 

In the simplest terms the relationship be- 
tween advertiser and agency may be described 
as follows The advertiser tells the agent what he 
wants to sell and at what price. The agency, in 
consultation with the advertiser, then creates 
and produces the advertising and recommends 
the budget, the media to be used, and the 
scheduling of the various facets of the cam- 
paign 

The magnitude of such operations in the U S 
IS indicated by the volume of advertising placed 
and handled by some leading firms in a single 
year In 1971 the two largest advertisers in the 
nation, Procter & Gamble Manufacturing Com- 
pany and Sears Roebuck and Company, each 
spent more than $200,CXX),000 to sell their prod- 
ucts through newspapers, consumer and other 
magazines, spot and network radio and televi- 
sion, and outdoor advertising Procter & Gam- 
ble, to promote its soaps, detergents, food proo- 
ucts, dentifrices, toilet products, and other 
Items, invested about $275,000,000 m advertis- 
ing. Sears Roebuck, a chain of department 
stores, spent about $200,000,000 The leading ad- 
vertising agency was the J Walter Thompson 
Company, which m 1971 handled accounts to- 
taling $774,000,000 in billings The Interpublic 
Group of Companies, Inc., the parent of several 
advertising and public-relations agencies, re- 
ported 1971 combined billings of $750,000,000. 
Economic and Social Effects. With three mil- 
lion business enterprises using one or more 
forms of advertising, every American citizen 
hears or sees advertising from all sides every day 
of the year, unless he deliberately shuts himself 
off from this persistent adjunct of modern civili- 
zation In the U S the money invested in adver- 
tising equaled approximately $100 per capita in 
1971 The high per capita cost of U.S. advertising 
leads many critics to attack it as a wasteful, un- 
necessary, unreliable, and annoying institution 
Such critics usually argue that the industry adds 


187 



ADVERTISING 


unnecessarily to the cost of goods and services 
promoted by it The proponents of advertising 
recognize some validity in these criticisms, but 
in rebuttal point out that by interesting consum- 
ers m purchasing commodities, advertising ena- 
bles manufacturers and others to sell their prod- 
ucts m much larger quantities than they would 
otherwise, the increased volume of sales in turn 
enables businessmen to sell individual units at 
lower cost than if they were produced m small 
quantities 

In the opinion of most top business execu- 
tives and of many economists, modern advertis- 
ing plays an integral role in the development of 
markets for the low-cost goods made possible 
by the high productivity of American industry A 
recent worldwide study of national investment 
m advertising, which showed a direct correla- 
tion with living standards, supports this thesis 

It should be noted also that advertising 
supplies most of the operating funds of the 
principal communications media According to 
a recent authoritative survey, the radio and tele- 
vision industry depends upon advertising for all 
of Its revenue Metropolitan newspapers derive 
about 70 percent of their income from advertis- 
ing, and national magazines, some 65 percent 
An example of the implications of this support 
IS that the Sunday edition of the New York 
Times, if It were to be profitably published on 
circulation revenue alone, would have to cost 
$6 to $7 per copy 

Regulation. Before the advertising industry 
became well organized, the sharp and unethical 
practices of some advertisers prompted the 
passing of many laws and legal restrictions by 
the Federal, State, and municipal governments 
At present, advertising is one of the most strictly 
regulated industries in the USA number of 
Federal bureaus exercise legal powers over ad- 
vertising An overlapping of authority exists 
among the bureaus, and in some instances one 
or more governmental bodies attempt to en- 
force conflicting regulations The Federal gov- 
ernment has failed to develop a coordinated ap- 
proach to the problems of the industry. The 
Federal agencies, however, wield considerable 
influence, mainly by threats of court action or of 
withdrawal of business licenses from firms ac- 
cused of unethical practices. In 1%9, for exam- 
ple, the Federal Communications Commission 
(q v ), known as the F.C C , began pressing for a 
ban on the use of broadcast advertising by ciga- 
rette companies On March 10, 1970, a bill was 
passed by the United States Senate prohibiting 
such cigarette advertising The law became ef- 
fective in January, 1972 


State laws and enforcement bureaus impose 
additional regulations on certain types of adver- 
tising, particularly those involving contests 
These regulations may differ from State to State 
Consequently, advertisers planning a national 
campaign through newspapers may have to pre- 
pare several different versions of an advertise- 
ment to comply with the varying laws In some 
States the media are themselves regulated For 
example, it is illegal in a number of States for 
radio and television stations to broadcast ''hard 
liquor" advertising, outdoor advertising is 
banned m certain other States 

Despite, of possibly because of, such wide- 
spread legal curbs, the advertising industry has 
resorted to self-regulation in a serious effort to 
stop abuses before they occur These self-im- 
posed codes of ethics and procedures aim prin- 
cipally to curtail not only bad taste but also mis- 
representation and deception m copy and 
illustrations, as well as derogatory and unfair 
representations of products of competitors 

Several advertising trade associations are con- 
cerned with maintaining high standards The as- 
sociations feel It IS good public relations to do 
so, inasmuch as advertising that weakens public 
confidence damages the impact and influence 
of all advertising 

Individual media and media groups often es- 
tablish their own codes of ethics Some newspa- 
pers and magazines refuse to publish advertis- 
ing for tobacco and alcoholic beverages, all of 
them, in varying degree, investigate the reliabil- 
ity of an advertiser before accepting his copy 
Some publishers have strict rules about the 
presentation of advertising to prevent the publi- 
cation of false or exaggerated claims and to pre- 
serve the aesthetic tone of their publications 

Radio and television stations generally try to 
investigate the company and its product before 
broadcasting advertising messages that might 
cause unfavorable reverberations The networks 
and the National Association of Broadcasters 
have established codes regulating the advertis- 
ing of medical products and controlling con- 
tests, premiums, and other offers All the 
networks maintain so-called acceptance depart- 
ments, which screen both commercial and non- 
commercial scripts, either deleting or challeng- 
ing for substantiation any questionable material 
Most magazine publishers have their own strict 
rules on acceptance of advertising copy. 

The American Advertising Federation has long 
campaigned, through its advertising dubs, for 
"truth in advertising" The Institute of Outdoor 
Advertising encourages its members to improve 
the design of their advertising posters and signs

and, more importantly, to make sure they do not 
erect advertising billboards m locations where 
they will mar the landscape or otherwise offend 
the public The best-known and most active 
''policemen" in the advertising field are the Bet- 
ter Business Bureaus, which bring pressure to 
bear on unethical advertisers through persua- 
sion, publicity, or, in extreme cases, legal action 
The fact that local and national bureaus are sub- 
sidized by both advertisers and media reflects 
the conviction of modern business management 
that "good advertising is good business" 
History. The origins of advertising antedate 
the Christian era by many centuries One of the 
first known methods of advertising was the out- 
door display, usually an eye-catching sign 
painted on the wall of a building. Archeologists 
have uncovered many such signs, notably in the 
rums of ancient Rome and Pompeii An outdoor 


advertisement excavated in Rome offers prop- 
erty for rent, and one found painted on a wall in 
Pompeii calls the attention of travelers to a tav- 
ern situated in another town 

in medieval times word-of-mouth praise of 
products gave rise to a simple but effective form 
of advertising, the use of public or town criers 
The cners were strong-lunged citizens who read 
public notices aloud and were also employed by 
merchants to shout the praises of their wares 
Later they became familiar figures on the streets 
of colonial American settlements. The town 
criers were forerunners of the modern an- 
nouncer, who delivers radio and television com- 
mercials 

Although graphic forms of advertising ap- 
peared early in world history, printed advertis- 
ing made little headway until the invention of 
the movable-type printing press m Europe 


189 



ADVERTISING 


about 1440 The trademark, a two- or three-di- 
mensional insignia symbolizing a company or 
industry, dates from about the 16th century, 
when tradesmen and guildsmen posted charac- 
teristic symbols outside their shops Among the 
best-known trademarks surviving from early 
modern times are the striped pole of the barber 
and the three-ball sign of the pawnbroker 

In terms of both volume and technique, ad- 
vertising made its greatest advances in the U S 
In the early stages of American advertising na- 
tionwide promotion was impractical because 
the nation itself was underdevloped and lacked 
transcontinental transportation, distribution, 
and communications systems Eventually, how- 
ever, certain types of manufacturers conceived 
the idea of bypassing wholesalers and retailers 
and reaching the consumer through direct ad- 
vertising, mainly by means of catalogs The pi- 
oneers in this field were seed companies and 
book and pamphlet publishers Mail-order 
houses appeared on the scene as early as the 
1870's To the present day they have continued 
to expand their businesses through direct-mail- 
catalog and flyer advertising, although some 
of the biggest houses sell also through retail 
outlets 

Patent-medicine companies loomed large m 
newspaper and magazine advertising starting in 
the late 1870's They found a ready market be- 
cause doctors and reliable pharmacists were 
scarce outside the populated areas and the fron- 
tiersmen and farmers had to do much of their 
own doctoring The patent-medicine bottlers 
made a gross profit of from 80 to 90 percent and 
could therefore well afford to spend money 
publicizing their remedies 

Railroads and steamship lines also were 
among the early users of advertising in the U.S , 
not only to praise the luxury and comfort of 
their modes of travel but also to publish their 
schedules and rates. 

Late in the 19th century many American firms 
began to market packaged goods under brand 
names This development initiated a new era in 
the history of advertising Previously, such ev- 
eryday household products as sugar, soap, rice, 
molasses, butter, milk, lard, beans, candy, can- 
dles, and pickles had been sold m neighbor- 
hood stores from large bulk containers As a re- 
sult, consumers had seldom been aware of, or 
influenced by, brand names. 

The soapmakers were early advertisers of 
packaged and branded products. The first 
"'household name" soap brands, which date 
from about 1880, include Ivory, Pears', Sapolio, 
Colgate, Kirk's American Family, and Packer's. 


Soon afterward such brands as Royal Baking 
Powder, Quaker Oats, Baker's Chocolate, Hire's 
Root Beer, Regal Shoes, and Waterman's Pens 
were nationally advertised Shortly after the turn 
of the century Americans began to be aware of 
such brand names as Bon Ami, Wrigley, and 
Coca-Cola. 

After World War I advertising developed into 
a business so big that it became almost a trade- 
mark of America itself in the eyes of the world 
This expansion was stimulated by many techni- 
cal improvements, and the expanding American 
industry inspired innovations and improved 
techniques that benefited other facets of 
business m the nation 

The invention of electricity led to the illumi- 
nated outdoor poster, photoengraving and 
other modern printing inventions helped both 
the editorial and advertising departments of 
printed journals Advertising was used increas- 
ingly by public-relations specialists as an impor- 
tant means of communication The advent of 
radio in the 1920's stimulated a whole new tech- 
nique of selling by voice 

During World War II the American advertis- 
ing industry founded the War Advertising 
Council, a nonprofit public-service organization 
that employed the resources of modern ad- 
vertising to strengthen the American war effort 
After the war the organization continued, as 
The Advertising Council, to function in the pub- 
lic interest It has conducted, for example, na- 
tionwide drives to increase the sale of United 
States Savings Bonds, prevent forest fires and 
traffic accidents, promote religion, and encour- 
age aid to higher education Print and broadcast 
media contributed in excess of $468,000,000 
worth of advertising time and space to such 
projects during the calendar year of 1971 
Twenty-six advertising agencies contributed 
their creative services to all the council cam- 
paigns 

The most significant postwar development 
was the advent of television, a medium which 
forced the advertising industry to better its tech- 
niques of selling by the use of visual devices as 
well as by voice. E A DeW 

ADVOCATE (Lat advocatus, "one called to 
aid"), in a general sense, one who pleads for an- 
other m a court of law or other tribunal In 
Great Britain, professional advocates are called 
barristers and are permitted to plead or argue 
cases before the High Court of justice; a barris- 
ter IS distinguished from a solicitor, who may 
conduct litigation only in inferior courts (see 
Courts History) The avocat and avoue in 
France are analogous to the barrister and solici-

ing a race called the Myrmidons (qv) Aeacus 
ruled over his people with such justice that after 
his death he became one of the three judges of 
the underworld (see Hades). He was the father 
of Peleus and the grandfather of Achilles (qq v.) 
AEAEA, in Greek mythology, name of the two 
islands of the sun One island in the east repre- 
sented the land of the rising sun, and one in the 
west the land of the setting sun. On the eastern 
island dwelt Aeetes, son of the god Helios (q v.) 
On the western island lived Circe (q v ), daugh- 
ter of Helios. The eastern island was later identi- 
fied with the ancient region called Colchis, on 
the Black Sea, the western, with Circeo, a cape 
on the Bay of Caeta m Italy 
AEDES, formerly called Stegomyia, genus of 
mosquitoes of the subfamily Culcinae One 
species, A aegypti, which is responsible for the 
transmission of yellow fever (q.v ), is common 
throughout tropical and subtropical America 
Aedes tnsenatus, found throughout eastern 
United States, is also capable of transmitting 
yellow fever. Some members of the genus trans- 
mit the tropical and subtropical disease dengue 
(q V ), others transmit filariasis, one of the most 
serious of all tropical diseases (see Filaria) 
Aedes mosquitoes are striped on both body and 
legs Only females suck blood, and they bite 
during the day rather than at night See Mos- 
quito

works and exercising some police powers The 
aediles supervised the maintenance (including 
fire fighting) and repair of the temples, public 
buildings, streets, sewers, and aqueducts of the 
city of Rome, supervised the public markets, 
regulated weights and measures, directed the 
public games, and maintained public order 

The office was founded in 494 bc with the es- 
tablishment of two aedifeships to be held by 
members of the plebs (q v ), or common people 
The plebian aediles were elected annually by 
the plebs themselves In 367 bc two additional 
aediles, known as curule aediles, were installed 
in office, the curule aedileships initially were 
held alternately, year by year, by either patri- 
cians (q v ) or plebs In 44 b c two more plebian 
aediles were installed by the Roman dictator 
Gaius Julius Caesar (q.v ), himself a former cu- 
rule aediie, the new aediles, known as cenales, 
had the special function of overseeing the gram 
supply 

Traditionally, the aedileship was the second 
magistracy, following the quaestorship in the 
career of Roman politicians; see Quaestor In 
the last years of the republic the office was ea- 
gerly sought by ambitious politicians because of 
the opportunity it provided for building a public 
following Under the Roman Empire the office 
lost Its importance and by the 3rd century a d it 
had disappeared

King of Thebes She was msanefy jealous of her 
sister-in-law Niobe (qv), who had seven sons 
while she had only one Attempting to kill Nio- 
be's eldest boy, Aedon slew her own son by 
mistake The god Zeus (q v ) turned her into a 
nightingale whose melancholy song is a lament 
for the murdered child

AEGEAN CIVILIZATION, general term for the 
culture of Greece and of the Aegean basin in 
the Bronze Age It is also referred to as Mycen- 
aean and Mmoan from the excavations at My- 
cenae (in present-day Greece) in 1876 and on 
the island of Crete (ruled by the legendary King 
Minos) beginning m 1899 The findings drew at- 
tention to the highly developed culture of the 
early inhabitants of these places Later discover- 
ies, notably at Tiryns and Pylos, Greece, and His- 
sarlik, Turkey, the site of Troy (q v.), during the 
20th century indicate that the Aegean culture 
was widespread during the 2nd millennium bc, 
and that it had close connections with the con- 
temporary civilizations of Egypt and the Near 
East In architecture, painting, ceramic and lapi- 
dary art, and in the development of a picto- 
graphic script identified in 1955 as Greek, these 


peoples gave evidence of a cultural level which 
was not to be surpassed for a long time 

By the 3rd millennium bc most of the later 
Greek sites had been settled Before this time 
they had developed agriculture and animal hus- 
bandry, used painted pottery, and evolved a 
technique for making human figures m clay 
Their houses had solid stone foundations and 
some were built on the megaron plan, used for 
the temples of the classical age, of a great rec- 
tangular central hall with a circular hearth m the 
center Walls surrounding some of the villages 
indicate that the settlers felt a need for protec- 
tion 

By the beginning of the 3rd millennium met- 
als were being used and the Bronze Age had 
begun, this development continued into the 
2nd millennium Villages became larger and 
more numerous Lerna (in present-day Greece) 
on the Gulf of Argolts had a large palace at its 
center, probably the seat of a king or city-ruler 
like the legendary Greek king Agamemnon 
(q v ) jars and boxes were secured by individu- 
alized seals, showing that the concept of private 
property had developed 

The early phase of the Bronze Age on the 
mainland ended about 2000 bc with military 
conquest of the area by invaders from the north 
The invasion resulted in much destruction, and 
subsequent architecture, pottery, and tools re- 
veal the influence of the intruders. The most im- 
portant innovation was the potter's wheel; the 
later pottery is characterized by a symmetry and 
refinement of shape that indicate mastery of 
that device During the next period, known as 
the Middle Helladic or Middle Mmoan Age, the 
great palaces and fortifications in Mycenae and 
Tiryns, and in Knossbs, Crete, were built. Con- 
tacts with other civilizations are evidenced by 
the appearance m Egypt of the handsome Cre- 
tan pottery with its white designs painted on a 
black background. These contacts make it possi- 
ble to determine the approximate dates of the 
subsequent Aegean cultures by reference to 
Egyptian and western Asian documents with 
their relatively precise chronology. 

The transition to the Late Helladic or Late Mi- 
noan Age, beginning about 1600 bc, was grad- 
ual and peaceful Palaces, tombs, and fortifica- 
tions of the period reveal increased skill at 
large-scale stone construction The shaft graves 
of Mycenae, actually royal tombs, have yielded 
vessels and ornaments of gold and silver, en- 
graved gems, copper daggers inlaid with silver, 
and other objects testifying to the wealth and 
luxury of the age The pottery is gaily decorated 
with floral designs, marine scenes, and figures

known by Greeks as the Labyrinth, present a re- 
vealing picture of religious ceremonials and 
other activities Objects of Cretan manufacture 
were exported to the Greek mainland and to 
Egypt 

The flourishing life of Knossos was cut off 
early in the fifteenth century bc, when the un- 
fortified city was captured and burned A Greek 
occupation followed, as is proved by the many 
tablets in Greek written in the Linear B script, 
similar to those found later in Pylos and My- 
cenae (see Greek Language) From about 1400 to 
1200 Bc Mycenaean Greece came to dominate 
the commerce of the eastern Mediterranean 
Sea, and Greek colonies were planted in Cyprus 
and Syria, as well as southern Italy and Sicily 

This thriving society collapsed in the 12th 
century bc when much of Greece was laid 
waste by an invasion of unknown origin, but 
probably connected in some still undetermined 
way with the siege of Troy. See also Archeol- 
ogy. History; Art History Greek Art, Minoan

AEGEAN ISLANDS, numerous islands in the 
Aegean Sea between Greece and Asia Minor 
The chief islands are Euboea (which is by far the 
largest and adjoins the mainland of Greece), 
Thisos, Samothr^ki, L^svos, Limnos, Kos, 
Khios, and Samos All the islands are included in 
either the Sporades or the Cyclades (qq v.) 
groups The islands, many of which are of vol- 
canic origin, have a healthful climate and beau- 
tiful scenery In ancient times they played an 
important part in the course of Greek history, 
giving to the world many distinguished poets 
and philosophers The islands came under the 
control of Rome in the 2nd century b.c, and 
from the 5th to the 13th century a d were part of 
the Byzantine Empire During the 15th and 16th 
centuries the islands were conquered by Tur- 
key, and they remained under Turkish rule until 
1829, when most of them became part of the in- 
dependent kingdom of Greece, Since that time 
they have remained under Greek possession ex- 
cept for two short periods From 1911 to 1912, 
twelve of the Sporades, then still under Turkish 
rule, were held by Italy during the Italo-Turkish 
War (see Turkey, History), and during World 
War II, from 1941 to 1944, Greece was under the 
control of the Axis powers (q.v,), 

AEGEAN SEA, also known as Archipelago, arm 
of the Mediterranean Sea between Greece and 
Asia Minor. The name is variously explained in 
writings of antiquity as derived from Aegeus, 


King of Athens and father of Theseus (qv) or 
from Aegea, a queen of the Amazons who 
drowned in the sea, or from an ancient Creek 
town named Aegae The Aegean Sea is about 
400 mi, long and 180 mi wide. It is connected 
with the Sea of Marmara to the n e by the Strait 
of the Dardanelles The Aegean Sea is irregular 
m outline, with numerous gulfs, and is studded 
with islands (see Aegean Islands) At the begin- 
ning of recorded history, the Aegean Sea was 
the center of one of the earliest known Euro- 
pean civilizations (see Aegean Civilization) With 
the rise of the ancient Greek and Near Eastern 
cultures, the lands surrounding the sea became 
the sites of widely differing civilizations, and 
the culture of the Aegean islands became iden- 
tified with that of Greece

AEGIS. See Zeus 

AEGISTHUS, m Greek mythology, the son of 
Thyestes (q v ) and his daughter Pelopia. Desir- 
ing to avenge himself upon his brother Atreus 
(q,v.) and acting on the advice of the oracle at 
Delphi, Thyestes consummated an incestuous 
union with Pelopia. Shortly afterward, Atreus 
married Pelopia, not knowing she was his niece 
When Aegisthus was born, Atreus accepted him 
as his own son. Aegisthus later learned his true 
identity and, urged on by Thyestes, killed 
Atreus, While Agamemnon (q v.), King of My- 
cenae, was away fighting in the Trojan War 
(q.v ), Aegisthus became the lover of Queen 
Clytemnestra (q.v,). He helped Clytemnestra kill 
her husband upon his return from Troy (qv.) 
With the queen Aegisthus then ruled Mycenae 
for seven years; he was murdered by Agamem- 
non's son Orestes (q.v.). See Atreus, House

earthquake destroyed Helice (373 bc), Aegium 
became the chief city of the Achaean League 
(q V.), and the delegates of the league had their 
place of meeting m a grove near the town. The 
modern town is known as Aigion or Aegium

and Prague In 1877 he entered the diplomatic 
service of Austria-Hungary and, after holding 
subordinate positions, he was appointed minis- 
ter to Rumania in 1888 In 1889 he became am- 
bassador to Russia He served in this capacity 
until 1906, when he was appointed premier and 
minister of foreign affairs His policies as foreign 
minister led to the annexation of Bosnia and 
Hercegovina (now in Yugoslavia) by Austria- 
Hungary in 1908, an act which had far-reaching 
repercussions m subsequent European history

only source of information on his life About 
972, he entered the Benedictine school at Win- 
chester and became a monk In 987 he was sum- 
moned to rule over the abbey of Cernel in Dor- 
set, where he taught and preached Afterward, 
probably in 1006, he was made abbot of Eyn- 
sham Aelfric is best known for his Homilies, 
written in Old English Among his other works 
are A Treatise on the Old and New Testaments, 
the Heptateuchus, an abridged translation of 
the first seven books of the Old Testament; a 
Latin grammar and glossary, written in English 
for boys, and the Colloquium, which was de- 
signed to teach boys to speak Latin correctly 
On the basis of the last two, Aelfric is accorded 
the title of grammarian His writings include 
some of the best examples of Old Engfish prose 
extant 

AELIA CAPITOLINA, name given to the new 
city built in the 2nd century on the rums of Jeru- 
salem (qv) by the Roman emperor Hadrian 
(q V ) The city was declared a Roman colony, 
and jews were forbidden to enter it The name 
remained in use until the 4th century ad, the 
time of the first Christian emperors of Rome 
AELURUS, in Egyptian mythology, sacred cat 
worshiped as a deity and embalmed and buried 
after its death at Bubastis (q v ) According to 
the Greek historian Herodotus (qv), Aelurus 
was identified with Artemis (q v ), Greek god- 
dess of the hunt 

AEMILIAN WAY (Lat Via Aemiliana), ancient 
Roman road, about 175 mi long, built by the 
consul Marcus Aemilius Lepidus in 187 BC The 


course lies within present-day Italy. The road 
ran from Ariminum (now Rimmi), northwest to 
Placentia (now Piacenza), and was later ex- 
tended northwest across the Po R. to Medio- 
lanum (now Milan) Still later extensions to Au- 
gusta Praetoria, to Segusio, and to Aquileia, 
were also loosely called the Via Aemiliana 
Today the road follows the same route and even 
crosses some of the original bridges, and the 
district between Rimini and Piacenza still re- 
tains the name of Emilia, derived from that of 
the ancient highway 

AENEAS, in Roman mythology, the son of An- 
chises, a Trojan prince, and Venus (qv), god- 
dess of love After the capture of Troy (q v ) by 
the Greeks he was able, with the help of his 
mother, to escape from the fallen city. Carrying 
his aged father on his back and leading his little 
son by the hand, he made his way to the sea- 
coast, In the confusion of flight, his wife was 
left behind 

A long, perilous and adventure-filled voyage 
took him to Thrace, Delos, Crete, and Sicily, 
where his father died The goddess Juno (q v ), 
who had always hated Aeneas and wanted to 
keep him from founding Rome, which she knew 
he was destined to do, tried to drown him in a 
violent storm In the storm, he and his crew 
were cast up on the African coast, where they 
were welcomed by Dido (q v ), the beautiful

queen of Carthage Dido fell in love with Ae- 
neas and begged him to remain with her When 
he refused and set sail from Africa, she took her 
own life in despair 

After several years of wandering, Aeneas 
reached Italy and the mouth of the Tiber; there 
he was hospitably received by Latinus, the king 
of Latium (q v ) He became betrothed to Lavi- 
nia, the daughter of Latinus, but before he could 
marry her, Juno caused Turnus, the king of the 
Rutuli and a rejected suitor of Lavinia, to start 
war against Aeneas and Latinus The war was re- 
solved by hand-to-hand combat, in which Tur- 
nus was defeated and slam by Aeneas Aeneas 
then ruled for several years in Latium and, 
marrying Lavinia, founded the Roman race 

The great Roman epic, the Aeneid (q v ) by 
Vergil (q.v), tells the story of Aeneas' perilous 
wanderings in detail, and ends with the death of 
Turnus 

AENEAS SILVIUS, the name by which Pope 
Pius II (see under Pius) is frequently known 
AENEIDf the great national epic of Rome, 
composed between the years 29 and 19 Bc by 
the poet Publius Vergilius Maro, more familiarly 
known as Vergil (q v ) The epic was left without 
final revision upon the death of Vergil m 19 bc 
The Aeneid is a mythological work in twelve 
books, describing the wanderings of the hero 
Aeneas (qv) and a small band of Trojans after 
the fall of Troy (see Trojan War) Aeneas es- 
caped from Troy with the images of his ances- 
tral gods, carrying his aged father on his shoul- 
ders, and leading his young son Ascanius by the 
hand, but in the confusion of his hasty flight he 
lost his wife, Creusa. He collected a fleet of 
twenty vessels, and sailed with the surviving 
Trojans to Thrace, where they began building a 
city Aeneas subsequently abandoned his plan 
of a settlement there and went to Crete, but was 
driven from that island by a pestilence* After 
visiting Epirus and Sicily (where his father died), 
Aeneas was shipwrecked on the coast of Africa 
and welcomed by Dido (q v ), Queen of Car- 
thage After a time he again set sail. Dido, who 
had fallen in love with him, was heartbroken by 
his departure and committed suicide. After vis- 
iting Sicily again and stopping at Cumae, on the 
Bay of Naples, he landed at the mouth of the 
Tiber R, seven years after the fall of Troy. Ae- 
neas was welcomed by Latinus, King of Latium. 
Lavinia, the daughter of Latinus, was destined to 
marry a stranger, but her mother Amata had 
promised to give her in marriage to Turnus, King 
of the Rutulians A war ensued, which termi- 
nated with the defeat and death of Turnus, thus 
making possible the marriage of Aeneas and La- 


vinia Aeneas died three years later, and his son 
Ascanius founded Alba Longa (q v ), the mother 
city of Rome 

The Aeneid derives its plan of style and treat- 
ment primarily from the Iliad (q v ) and, to a 
lesser degree, from the Odyssey (q v.), the great 
epics of the Greek poet Homer (q v ) Vergil was 
partly influenced also by the epic poem Argo- 
nautica by the Greek poet Apollonius of Rhodes 
(q.v), and the Annales of the Roman poet 
Quintus Ennius (q v ), who was the first to intro- 
duce dactylic hexameter into Latin epic verse 
(see Versification) In the Aeneid, Vergii devel- 
oped both the music and the technical preci- 
sion of this meter so subtly that his verse ever 
since has been considered a model of literary 
perfection The Aeneid is usually considered the 
first great literary epic, in contrast to the lhad, 
which is constructed with literary artistry but 
contains a great number of usages and forms 
found in earlier oral poetry. The Aeneid, unlike 
the (had, is not an inherited part of a national 
consciousness, but rather a deliberate attempt 
to glorify the nation and, particularly, to cele- 
brate the achievements and ideals of the Roman 
state under its first emperor, Augustus (qv) 
The historical and Augustan elements are espe- 
cially prominent m Books 5-8, the central sec- 
tion of the poem 

Because of its ambitious design, the smooth 
beauty of its style, and its tenderness of feeling, 
the Aeneid is regarded as one of the greatest 
masterpieces of world literature. 

The Aeneid was highly appreciated in its own 
day To judge from the fine quality of the nu- 
merous manuscripts dating from the 3rd to the 
5th century a d , and the numerous references by 
later Roman writers, the Aeneid was popular for 
a long time after its composition During the 
Middle Ages philosophical meanings were read 
into the poem, and Vergil himself was thought 
to be a seer and a magician 

The importance of the Aeneid in the history 
of English poetry has been considerable The 
English poet Geoffrey Chaucer (q.v.) told part of 
the story in hts House of Fame Edmund Spenser 
(q.v.), in The Faene Queene, was indebted to 
Vergil for the conception of the epic as a na- 
tional poem. The style and technique of versifi- 
cation of such English poets as John Milton and 
Alfred Lord Tennyson (qq.v ) were influenced 
by the Latin of the Aeneid The work has been 
in widespread use as a school text for centuries 
Notable translations of the poem include those 
by the English poets John Dryden, William Mor- 
ns, and C{ecil) D(ay) Lewis (qq v ). See Epic Po- 
etry, Latin Literature

AEOLIANS^ one of the three great divisions of 
the Hellenic stock, tracing their descent from 
Aeolus (q v ) Originally settled in Thessaly, they 
founded numerous colonies in other parts of 
Greece In the 11th century bc many of them 
emigrated to the island of Lesvos in the Aegean 
Sea, they also founded cities on the west coast 
of Asia Minor, between the Dardanelles and the 
Hermus R This region became known as Aeolis

the oldest form of Hellenic speech See Greece 
History Ancient Greece, Greek Language 
AEOLUS, in Greek mythology, keeper of the 
winds He lived on the floating island Aeolia 
with his SIX sons and six daughters The god 
Zeus (q V ) had given him the power to regulate 
the winds, stilling them or arousing them as he 
wished When the Greek hero Odysseus (see 
Odyssey) visited him, Aeolus welcomed him as 
an honored guest As a parting gift he gave 
Odysseus a favoring wind and a leather bag m 
which he had put all the winds. Odysseus' sail- 
ors, thinking the bag contained gold, opened it 
and were at once swept back to Aeolia There 
Aeolus refused to help them again. See Ulysses 
AEOLUS, m Creek mythology, King of Thes- 
saly He was the son of Hellen (q v ), ancestor of 
the Hellenes, the ancient Greek peoples. Aeolus 
was himself the ancestor of the Aeolian Greeks

AEPYORNIS (Gr , "tall bird"), genus of several 
fossil birds from the island of Madagascar, espe- 
cially the "elephant bird" This great bird may 
have survived until the arrival of the first hu- 
mans on Madagascar and thus given rise to the 
legend of the roc, the gigantic mythical bird 
once believed to have inhabited India and later 
popularized in the Arabian Nights (q v ). 

The elephant bird was 8 to 9 ft tall and ex- 
tremely massive, weighing perhaps as much as 
1000 lb , by far the heaviest of any known bird 
Several of its eggs have been found fossilized in 
the mud of swamps 


AERATION, in water purification, the satura- 
tion of water with air Water is brought into 
contact with air in such a manner as to produce 
maximum diffusion (q v ), usually by spraying 
water into the air in fountains Aeration re- 
moves odors and taste caused by decomposing 
organic matter, and also industrial wastes such 
as phenols, and volatile gases such as carbon 
dioxide and chlorine (qq v ) It also converts dis- 
solved iron and manganese compounds into in- 
soluble hydrated oxides of the metals which 
may then be readily settled out

AERIAL SURVEY, photographing of territory 
by aircraft for mapping or military intelligence 
Experience gained during World War I showed 
that aerial surveying possesses valuable scien- 
tific and commercial appjications Almost all of 
continental United States has since been sur- 
veyed by the U S Department of Agriculture m 
a program for determining the regions best 
suited to certain crops Aerial surveying, usually 
much cheaper and quicker than the customary 
land-surveying methods, is also much more de- 
tailed and complies with the accepted standards 
of mapping accuracy. See Surveying 

The continuing development of cameras and 
of new, more efficient photographic film has 
made aerial photography a most important fac- 
tor in modern warfare Pictures taken from miles 
above the earth are almost incredible m detail 
Color photographs (see Photography Color 
Photography) and photographs taken with 
haze-penetrating infrared film are valuable in 
the exposure of camouflage (q v ) Photographs 
at night are taken on supersensitive film in 
moonlight or with the aid of searchlights or 
magnesium flash bombs 

Aerial surveys are commonly made with the 
camera center vertical Frequency of exposure is 
timed to provide at least 50 percent of picture 
overlay in the direction of the flight. If a single 
flight line does not give sufficient breadth of 
coverage, additional parallel lines are flown with 
a side overlap of 30 percent or more The photo- 
graphs are then mounted to form a mosaic and 
yield a maplike picture Two aerial pictures of 
the same terrain can be viewed stereoscop i cal !y, 
the resultant three-dimensional image is called a 
stereogram This is literally a scale model of the 
terrain on which the viewer can measure the 
horizontal distance and elevational difference 
between any two points he can see Such sur-

1950's to fly at altitudes above 60,000 ft. The 
wing design of the U-2 permitted long-distance 
gliding without engine power to reduce the 
likelihood of detection from the ground. More 
recently, aerial surveillance has largely been 
taken over by artificial earth satellites and both 
the US and the Soviet Union orbit satellites

AERODYNAMICS^ branch of fluid mechanics 
(q V ) that deals with the motion of air and other 
gaseous fluids, and with the forces acting on 
bodies in motion relative to such fluids. The 
motion of an airplane through the air, the wind 
forces exerted on a structure, and the operation 
of a windmill are all examples of aerodynamic 
action, see Airplane, Windmill, Wind Tunnel 
One of the fundamental laws governing the 


motion of fluids is Bernoulli's principle (qv) 
which relates an increase m flow velocity to a 
decrease in pressure and vice versa Bernoulli's 
principle is used in aerodynamics to explain the 
lift of an airplane's wing in flight. A wing is so 
designed that air flows more rapidly over its 
upper surface than its lower one, leading to a 
decrease in pressure on the top surface as com- 
pared to the bottom The resulting pressure dif- 
ference provides the lift that sustains the aircraft 
m flight, see Flight, Theory of The velocity of a 
wind that strikes the bluff surface of a building 
IS close to zero near its wall According to Ber- 
noulli's principle, this would lead to a rise in 
pressure relative to the pressure away from the 
building, resulting in wind forces which the 
structures must be designed to withstand 
Another important aspect of aerodynamics is 
the drag or resistance acting on solid bodies 
moving through air The drag forces exerted by 
the air tlowing over the airplane, for example, 
must be overcome by the thrust force devel- 
oped by either the jet engine or the propellers 
These drag forces can be significantly reduced 
by streamlining the body For bodies that are 
not fully streamlined, the drag force increases 
approximately with the square of the speed as 
they move rapidly through the air The power 
required, for example, to drive an automobile 
steadily at medium or high speeds is primarily 
absorbed in overcoming air resistance Thus the 
power required to drive a car at 70 m p.h is al- 
most twice as much as that required at 50 m p h

example of this phenomenon. Aerosol insect 
bombs, because of this principle, are effective in 
killing flying insects, particularly in enclosed or 
sheltered places The bomb contains an oil solu- 
tion of insecticides and a liquid that vaporizes 
at room temperature. When a valve in the bomb 
IS opened, the vapor sprays from a nozzle and 
propels the insecticide into the air, thus dispers- 
ing the Off droplets See Colloidal Dispersion

The propellants used for 90 percent of the 
nonfood sprays, fluorocarbon 11 (CFCI3) and 
fluorocarbon 12 (CCF 2 CI 2 ), are exceptionally 
inert and nontoxic compounds of carbon, flu- 
orine, and chlorine In 1974 it was discovered 
that each year 800,000 tons of these fluorocar- 
bons, half of them discharged m aerosol sprays, 
were floating unchanged up to the stratosphere 
There, intense sunlight could break off the chlo- 
rine atoms, each of which in turn could break 
up thousands of ozone molecules (O3) in the 
stratospheric ozone layer See Atmosphere Since 
this thin layer of ozone absorbs the excessive 
ultraviolet rays that would otherwise damage 
many forms of life on earth, several scientific 
studies were begun in 1975 to determine 
whether the ozone layer was self-repainng or 
whether it was being depleted permanently 
Conclusive analysis was expected to take several 
years In the meantime, other propellants were 
beginning to replace fluorocarbons in aerosol 
spray containers

AEROSPACE MEDICINE, branch of medicine 
concerned with the physiological and psycho- 
logical stresses upon the human body in flight 
through the atmosphere (q v ) or m the space 
environment The term embraces the fields of 
aviation medicine and space medicine (qq v ) 
Aerospace medicine was recognized by the 
American Medical Association as a subspecialty 
m preventive medicine in 1953 Aerospace 
medical specialists, along with members of al- 
lied specialties in the biological and physical 
sciences, form part of the interdisciplinary team 
that also includes engineers who carry out re- 
search and development programs to advance 
aerospace technology 

History. Aerospace medicine is rooted in the 
early 18th-century physiological studies of bal- 
loonists and mountain climbers Particularly sig- 
nificant were the contributions of John Jeffries 
(1744-1819), an American physician living in 
England, who in 1784 made the first scientific 
study of the upper-air composition from a bal- 
loon The principles and practice of aerospace 
medicine m all major nations have kept pace 
with the rapid advances in aircraft and rocket 
technology during the 20th century In the 
United States, for example, physical and psycho- 
logical standards for aviators were established 
by the Surgeon General of the Army shortly be- 
fore World War I Following the war, the School 
of Aviation Medicine was established at Ran- 
dolph Air Force Base, Texas The first Depart- 
ment of Space Medicine was set up there in 
February, 1949, under the direction of Dr Hu- 
bertus Strughold (1898- ), pioneer in Ger- 

man aviation medicine In 1959 the school was 
moved to new and expanded facilities at nearby 
Brooks Air Force Base, Texas, and renamed the 
School of Aerospace Medicine As early as 1926, 
civil aviation medicine had gone forward with 
the establishment of a medicine section in the 
Bureau of Air Commerce within the U S Depart- 
ment of Commerce Other important military 
research and training institutions include the 
US. Naval School of Aviation Medicine at Pen- 
sacola, Fla , organized in 1939, the Aviation 
Medical Acceleration Laboratory at johnsville, 
Pa., and the Naval Aircrew Equipment Labora- 
tory at Philadelphia, Pa 

Experimental military aircraft m the post- 
World War II period, namely the X-12 and the X- 
15, had brought man to the limits of the earth 
atmosphere, providing additional valuable in- 
formation about both the environment and 
about human physiological reactions to high- 
speed, high-altitude travel In addition, aero- 
space medicine profited from biological experi-

ments in the upper atmosphere. These were 
carried out on a limited basis in the post-World 
War II period by military and university scien- 
tists, using captured German V-2 rockets at 
Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico Manned 
and unmanned balloon flights to study the 
effects of altitude were other forerunners of 
actual space flight 

Space Research. The U S. National Aeronau- 
tics and Space Administration (q.v ), or NASA, is 
responsible for nonmilitary manned and un- 
manned space exploration for scientific, includ- 
ing medical, purposes The agency works closely 
with the scientific community and with the 
Department of Defense in carrying out all 
phases of aerospace medical research and ap- 
plied space medicine Limited NASA-conducted 
research in the biological sciences is centered at 
Ames Research Center, California, and Langley 
Research Center, Virginia, whereas applied 
aerospace medicine research and medical oper- 
ations for manned space flight are centered at 
the Lyndon B Johnson Space Center, Houston, 
Texas For the most part, NASA contracts with 
universities and industry for its research and 
development in aerospace medicine, biology, 
and life-support research and technology. In the 
late 1960's and early 1970's, NASA concentrated 
largely upon its aeronautics research and devel- 
opment efforts Related civilian and military 
projects helped advance clinical, environmen- 
tal, and preventive aerospace medicine. Ad- 
vanced research involved (1) traditional stress 
problems; (2) biological effects of time lag in 
high-speed, global transport; (3) physical effects 
of supersonic aircraft upon the earth environ- 
ment and ground population, and (4) the en- 
demic communicable-disease problems facing 
the global traveler.»See Astronautics; Space Bioi-

AESCHINES (389-314 bc), ancient Greek ora- 
tor, born in Athens Aeschines became one of 
the leading men of the Athenian state through 
his eloquence and his legal knowledge. As a 
member of an embassy to Philip II (q v.). King of 
Macedonia, in 347 bc, he decided that Athenian 
resistance to the Macedonians would be futile, 
and so became the leader of the peace party at 
Athens in opposition to the orator Demos- 
thenes (qv,), the spokesman for those who 
believed that Philip should be resisted at any 
cost Aeschines' hatred of his rival, however, led 
to his downfall In 337 bc he prosecuted the 
Athenian orator Ctesiphon (fl 4th cent b.c) 
when the latter proposed that a golden crown 
be awarded to Demosthenes; the charge was 
actually an attack upon the whole foreign policy 


of Demosthenes The trial took place in 330 bc 
Aeschines lost the case and was fined heavily 
whereupon he went into exile and, according to 
tradition, opened a school of oratory at Rhodes 
His posthumous fame as an orator may be 
attributed to his three extant speeches Against 
Ttmarchus, On the Embassy, and Against Ctesi- 
phon 

AESCHYLUS (525-456 bc), Greek dramatist 
the earliest of the great tragic poets of Athens 
and hence called the "Father of Greek Tragedy" 
born m Eleusis, near Athens Aeschylus fought 
successfully against the Persians at Marathon in 
490 BC, at Salamis m 480, and possibly also at 
Plataea in the following year He made at least 
two trips to Sicily, possibly three During his 
final visit he died at Gela, where a monument 
was later erected to his memory 
The Plays. Aeschylus is said to have written 
about ninety plays. His tragedies, first per- 
formed about 500 BC, were presented as trilo- 
gies, or groups of three, usually bound together 
by a common theme, and each trilogy was 
followed by a satyr drama (low comedy involv- 
ing a mythological hero, with a chorus of satyrs) 
The titles of seventy-nine of his plays are 
known, but only seven have survived The 
earliest is The Suppliants, a drama with little 
action but many choral songs of great beauty, it 
IS believed to be the first play of a trilogy about 
the fifty daughters of Danaus, which included 
the plays entitled The Egyptians and The Da- 
nafds. The Persians, presented in 472, is a 
historical tragedy about the Battle of Salamis, 
the scene being laid in Persia at the court of the 
mother of King Xerxes 1 (q v.) No relationship 
between this drama and any of the other titles 
known is apparent. 

The Seven Against Thebes, produced in 467, is 
based on a Theban legend, the conflict between 
the two sons of Oedipus, Eteocles and Polynei- 
ces for the throne of Thebes (see Seven Against 
Thebes), it is generally believed to be the third 
play of a trilogy, of which the first two plays 
were entitled talus and Oedipus. Prometheus 
Bound, a work of uncertain date, portrays the 
punishment of the defiant Prometheus by Zeus 
It is probably the first play of a Promethean 
trilogy, the others being the plays entitled Pro- 
metheus Unbound and Prometheus the Fire- 
Bnngen 

The remaining three plays, Agamemnon, The 
Ubatron Bearers, and The Eumentdes, produced 
ii>458, form the trilogy known as the Oresteia, 
or story of Orestes In Agamemnon, one of the 
greatest works of dramatic literature, King 
Agamemnon returns home from Troy and is 


200 



treacherously murdered by his faithless wife 
Clytemnestra In the second play, Orestes, the 
son of Agamemnon, returns to Argos and 
avenges the murder of his father by slaying his 
mother and her paramour Aegisthus This act of 
matricide is punished by the avenging god- 
desses, the Erinyes In The Eumemdes, Orestes is 
pursued by the Erinyes until he is cleansed of 
his blood guilt and set free by the ancient court 
of the Areopagus, through the intercession of 
Athena, goddess of wisdom 
Importance. Aeschylus is generally considered 
the originator of Greek tragedy By introducing 
a second actor into the play, he created dra- 
matic dialogue, he also made many alterations 
in the form and staging of the drama The char- 
acteristics of his works are simplicity, pic- 
turesqueness, and grandeur He had a deep and 
abiding interest in religion, and the Oresteta, 
probably his most mature work, provides an in- 
sight into his concepts of justice and mercy, and 
his belief in a divine will, with the aid of which 
man can achieve wisdom through suffering

genus Elaphe includes several other European 
snakes, including the leopard snake, and several 
American snakes, including the corn snake,

AESOP (about 620-560 bc), ancient Greek 
writer of fables who is supposed to have been a 
freed slave from Phrygia His name became at- 
tached to the beast fables, long transmitted 
through oral tradition The beast fables are part 
of the common culture of the Indo-European 
peoples and constitute perhaps the most widely 
read collection of fables in world literature (see 
Fable) Many of Aesop's fables were rewritten in 
verse by the Creek poet Babrius, probably m the 
1st or 2nd century ad, and in Latin verse by the 
Roman poet Phaedrus in the 1st century a d The 
collection which now bears Aesop's name con- 
sists for the most part of prose paraphrases of 
the fables of Babrius. 

AESTHETICS, or ESTHETICS, branch of philos- 
ophy concerned with the essence and percep- 
tion of beauty and ugliness, and whether such 
qualities are objectively present in the things 
they appear to qualify, or whether they exist 
only in the mind of the individual, hence, 
whether objects are perceived by a particular 
mode, the aesthetic mode, or whether instead 


201 


AESTHETICS 


the objects have, m themselves, special quali- 
ties — aesthetic qualities 
Criticism and the psychology of art, although 
independent disciplines, are related to aesthet- 
ics The psychology of art deals with such ele- 
ments of the arts as human responses to color, 
sound, line, form, and words, and with the emo- 
tional factors which condition such responses 
Criticism confines itself to particular works of 
art, analyzing their structure, meaning, and 
problems, comparing them with other works, 
and evaluating them 

The term '"aesthetics" was introduced in 1753 
by the German philosopher Alexander Gottlieb 
Baumgarten, but the study of the nature of 
beauty had been pursued for centuries 
The Classical Period. The first aesthetic 
theory of any scope is that of the Greek philoso- 
pher Plato, who believed that reality consists of 
archetypes, or forms, beyond human sensation, 
which are the models for all things that exist in 
human experience The objects of such experi- 
ence are examples, or imitations, of those forms 
The philosopher tries to reason from the object 
he experiences to the reality it imitates, the art- 
ist copies the experienced object, or uses it as a 
model for his work Thus, the artist's work is an 
imitation of an imitation it is two removes from 
what IS believed to be reality 

Plato's thinking had a marked ascetic strain 
In his Republic Plato went so far as to banish 
some types of artists from his ideal society be- 
cause he thought their work encouraged immo- 
rality or portrayed base characters, and that cer- 
tain musical compositions caused languidness 
or incited men to immoderate actions 
The Greek philosopher Aristotle also spoke of 
art as imitation, but not in the Platonic sense 
One could imitate "things as they ought to be", 
he wrote, and "art partly completes what nature 
cannot bring to a finish". The artist separates 
the form from the matter of some object of ex- 
perience, such as the human body or a tree, and 
imposes that form on another matter, such as 
canvas or marble. Thus imitation is not just 
copying an original model, nor is it devising a 
symbol for the original; rather, it is a particular 
representation of an aspect of things, and each 
work is an imitation of the universal whole 
Aesthetics was as inseparable from morality 
and politics for Aristotle as for Plato The former 
wrote about music in his Politics, maintaining 
that art affected human character, and hence 
the social order Because Aristotle held that 
happiness was the aim of life, the major func- 
tion of art was to provide human satisfaction. In 
the Poetics, his great work on the principles of 


drama, Aristotle argued that tragedy so stimu- 
lated the emotions of pity and fear, which he 
held to be morbid and unhealthful, that by the 
end of the play the spectator was purged of 
them This catharsis made the audience psy- 
chologically healthier, and thus more capable of 
happiness Neoclassical drama has been greatly 
influenced by Aristotle's Poetics The works of 
the French dramatists Jean Baptiste Racine 
Pierre Corneille, and Moliere, m particular, ad- 
vocate Its doctrine of the three unities time 
place, and action This concept dominated liter- 
ary theories up to the '19th century 

The philosopher Plotinus, born in Egypt and 
trained in philosophy at Alexandria, although a 
Neoplatonist, gave far more importance to art 
than did Plato In his view art reveals the form of 
an object more clearly than ordinary experience 
does, and raises the soul to contemplation of 
the universal According to Plotinus, the highest 
moments of life are mystical, which is to say 
that the soul is united, in the world of forms, 
with the divine, which Plotinus spoke of as "the 
One" Aesthetic experience comes closest to 
mystical experience, for one loses himself while 
contemplating the aesthetic object 
The Modem Period. Art in the Middle Ages 
was chiefly an expression of religion, with an 
aesthetic principle based largely upon Neopla- 
tonism During the Renaissance (q v ), art be- 
came more secular, and its aesthetics were clas- 
sical rather than religious The great impetus to 
aesthetic thought in the modern world occurred 
m Germany during the 18th century. The Ger- 
man critic Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, in his Lao- 
koon (1766), argued that art is self-limiting, and 
reaches its apogee only when these limitations 
are recognized The German critic and classical 
archeologist Johann Joachim Winckelmann 
maintained that, in accordance with the ancient 
Greeks, the best art was impersonal, expressing 
ideal proportion and balance rather than its 
creator's individuality Johann Gottlieb Fichte, a 
philosopher and metaphysician, considered 
beauty a moral virtue. The artist creates a world 
of his own in which beauty, as much as truth, is 
an end, foreshadowing that absolute freedom 
which IS the goal of the human will. For Fichte, 
art is individual, not social, but it fulfills a great 
human purpose. 

The German philosopher, Immanuel Kant was 
concerned with judgments of taste Objects are 
judged beautiful, he proposed, when they sat- 
isfy a disinterested desire* one that does not in- 
volve our personal interests or needs It follows 
from this that beautiful objects have no specific 
purpose, and that judgments of beauty are not 


202 



AESTHETICS 


expressions of mere personal preference, but 
are universal instead, and that although we can- 
not be certain that others will be satisfied by 
objects we judge to be beautiful, we can at least 
say that they ought to be satisfied The basis for 
one's response to beauty exists in the structure 
of one's mind 

Art should give the same disinterested satis- 
faction as natural beauty Paradoxically, art can 
accomplish one thing nature cannot It can offer 
ugliness and beauty in one and the same object 
A fine painting of an ugly face is nonetheless 
beautiful 

According to the philosophy of the German 
Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, art, religion, 
and philosophy are the bases of the highest 
spiritual development Beauty in nature is every- 
thing that the human spirit finds pleasing and 
congenial to the exercise of spiritual and intel- 
lectual freedom. Certain things in nature can be 
made more congenial and pleasing, and it is 
these natural objects which are reorganized by 
art to satisfy aesthetic demands. 

The German philosopher Arthur Schopen- 
hauer believed that the forms of the universe, 
like the eternal Platonic forms, exist beyond the 
world of experience, and aesthetic satisfaction 
is achieved by contemplation of them for their 
own sakes, as a means of escaping the painful 
world of daily experience 

Fichte, Kant, and Hegel are in a direct line of 
development Schopenhauer attacked Hegel 
but was influenced by Kant's view of disinter- 
ested contemplation The German philosopher 
and poet Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche followed 
Schopenhauer at first, then disagreed with him 
Nietzsche concurred that life was tragic, but 
thought that this should not preclude man's ac- 
ceptance of the tragic with joyous affirmation, 
the full realization of which is art Art confronts 
the terrors of the universe, and is therefore only 
for the strong Art can transform any experience 
into beauty, and by so doing transforms its hor- 
rors in such a way that man can contemplate 
them with enjoyment 

Although much of modern aesthetics is 
rooted in German thought, German thinking 
was subject to other Western influences Less- 
ing, a founder of German Romanticism (qv), 
was affected by the aesthetic writings of the 
British statesman Edmund Burke. 

Major controversies over the nature and use 
of art have usually resulted from the prac- 
tices and pronouncements of artists, not from 
the speculations of philosophers The French 
painter Gustave Courbet urged that artists paint 
objects in their own milieu realistically. The im- 


pressionists argued that when artists depict 
what they really see, rather than what they think 
they should see, they paint surfaces of many 
colors and of wavering forms, because light er- 
odes form and alters it as the sun moves and 
shadows change Thus, academic paintings 
could be denounced as portrayals of what artists 
had been taught to look for rather than of what 
they actually saw 

During the last quarter of the 19th century a 
group of French artists, including Andre Derain, 
Paul Cezanne, Paul Gauguin, and Henri Matisse, 
revolted against impressionism (q v ) They were 
concerned with symbolizing picture structure, 
volume, and the artist's own psyche A corre- 
sponding symbolism appears in the writing of 
the French poet Charles Baudelaire and an en- 
tire generation of French poets 

Expressionism (q.v ), in contrast to impres- 
sionism, subordinates the representation of 
objects to the expression of emotion The term 
"expressionism" was first used in 1911 m Mu- 
nich as the designation of a German school of 
art It was used also to designate a literary 
movement which originated in the theater with 
the plays of the Swedish playwright August 
Strindberg and the German playwright Frank 
Wedekind 

One of the artists' most persistent credos is 
"art for art's sake", a phrase used by the French 
philosopher Victor Cousin in 1818 This doctrine 
was espoused in 19th-century Great Britain by 
the British critic Walter Horatio Pater and the 
expatriate American painter James Abbott 
McNeill Whistler The British critic Matthew Ar- 
nold felt that art must criticize life 

Eighteenth-century aesthetics was dominated 
by the concept of art as imitation, thereafter, it 
was based increasingly on art as expression, 
wherein the artist does not state his meanings, 
as the scientist does, but expresses himself in 
the work of art 

The Contemporary Period. Four philoso- 
phers of the late“19th and early-20th centuries 
have been the chief influences on present-day 
aesthetics The French philosopher Henri Berg- 
son defined science as the use of intelligence to 
create a system of symbols that supposedly de- 
scribes reality but actually falsifies it Art, how- 
ever, IS based on intuition, which is a direct ap- 
prehension of reality unmediated by thought. 
Thus art cuts through conventional symbols and 
beliefs about man, life, and society, and con- 
fronts one with reality itself 

The Italian philosopher Benedetto Croce also 
exalts intuition, but considers it to be the imme- 
diate awareness of an object which, somehow, 


203 



AESTHETICS 


gives It form It is the apprehension of things 
before one reflects about them Works of art are 
the expression, in material form, of such intui- 
tions, but beauty and ugliness are qualities not 
of the works of art but of the spirit expressed 
intuitively m such works 
The American philosopher and poet George 
Santayana argued that when one takes pleasure 
in a thing he may regard the pleasure as a qual- 
ity of the thing itself, rather than as a subjective 
response to it Just as one may characterize 
some human act as good in itself, instead of 
calling It good merely because one approves It, 
so one may say that some object is beautiful, 
not merely that one's aesthetic delight in its 
color and form leads one to call it beautiful 
John Dewey, the American educator and phi- 
losopher, viewed human experience as discon- 
nected, fragmentary, full of beginnings without 
conclusions, or as experiences deliberately ma- 
nipulated as means to ends Those exceptional 
experiences which flow from their beginnings 
to consummations are aesthetic Aesthetic ex- 
perience IS enjoyment for its own sake, is com- 
plete and self-contained, and is terminal, not 
merely instrumental to other purposes 
Two powerful movements, Marxism in the 
fields of economics and politics and Freudi- 
anism m psychology, have had important conse- 
quences for contemporary aesthetics. Marxism 
treats art as an expression of the underlying eco- 
nomic relations in society Marxist proponents 
maintain that art is great only when it is "pro- 
gressive", that IS, when it supports the cause of 
the society under which it is created 
The Austrian neurologist and originator of 
psychoanalysis, Sigmund Freud, believed the 
value of art to he in its therapeutic use: it is by 
this means that the artist or the reader can re- 
veal his hidden conflicts and discharge his ten- 
sions Fantasies and daydreams, as they enter 
into art, are thus transformed from an escape 
from life into ways of meeting it In the surreal- 
ist movement in painting and poetry, the un- 
conscious is used as a source of material. See 
Surrealism, The stream-of-consciousness (q.v.) 
technique of fiction, notably in the writings of 
the Irish writer James Joyce, derived not only 
from Freud's work but partly from The Prin- 
ciples of Psychology (1890) by the American 
psychologist and philosopher William James 
and partly from the novel Les Launers Sont 
Coupes (1887; Eng trans , We7/ to the Woods 
No More, 1957) by the French writer Edouard 
Dujardin (1861-1949). 

More recently the form of existentialism (q.v,) 
advocated by the French philosopher, novelist, 


and dramatist Jean-Paul Sartre has stated that art 
IS an expression of the freedom of man to 
choose, and as such demonstrates his responsi- 
bility for his choices Despair, as reflected in art 
IS not an end, but a beginning, because it eradi- 
cates the guilts and excuses from which men or- 
dinarily suffer, thus opening the way for genu- 
ine freedom 

Academic controversies of the 20th century 
have revolved about meaning in art The British 
critic and semanticist Ivor Armstrong Richards 
believes that art is a language He asserts that 
there are two types of language the symbolic, 
which conveys ideas and information, and the 
emotive, which expresses, evokes, and excites 
feelings and attitudes Art is emotive language, 
giving order and coherence to experience and 
attitudes, but containing no symbolic meaning. 

Richards' work is important also for its use of 
psychological techniques m studying aesthetic 
reactions. His book, Practical Criticism (1929), 
describes experiments which revealed that even 
highly educated people were conditioned by 
their education, by handed-down opinion, and 
by other social and circumstantial factors in 
their aesthetic responses Other writers have 
commented on the conditioning effects of tra- 
dition, fashion, and other social pressures, using 
as illustrations the shifts of tastes in certain peri- 
ods during which William Shakespeare was 
viewed as barbarous and Gothic art as vulgar 

Growing interest m aesthetics is revealed by 
the establishment of three periodicals devoted 
to the subject. The Journal of Aesthetics and Art 
Critic isnn was founded in the United States in 
1941, the Revue ,d'Esth6tique was founded in 
France in 1946, and The British Journal of 
Aesthetics, founded in 1960.

AETOLIA, district of ancient Greece on the n 
coast of the Gulf of Corinth. In Greek mythol- 
ogy, Meleager, son of the king of Calydon, slew 
the Calydonian boar m Aetolia The people of 
Aetolia began to figure prominently in recorded 
history about the time of the death of the Mace- 
donian ruler Alexander Hi (q v.), known as the 
Great, in 323 b.c. The Aetolian League, similar to 
the Achaean League (q.v.), was formed toward 
the close of the 4th century bc and waged war 
against the Achaean League, Macedonia, and

eventually even against Rome, its former ally 
The Romans defeated the Aetohan League m 
189 B c and put an end to its political influence. 
Aetolsa forms part of the present-day Greek de- 
partment (or nome) of Aetolia and Acarnanta 
AFARS AND ISSAS, FRENCH TERRITORY OF 
THE^ former name of DJIBOUTI, a republic of 
NE Africa Known as French Somaliland until 
1967, It IS bounded on the E by the Strait of Bab 
el Mandeb (the entrance to the Red Sea) and the 
Gulf of Aden, on the s.E by the Somali Republic, 
and on the s and w. by Ethiopia Djibouti is the 
capital, largest city (pop 1976 est 120,000), and 
principal port Area about 8500 sq mi , pop. 
(1976 est ) 226,000, including more than 42,000 
Afars and 58,000 Issas The Afars are a branch of 
the Danakil peoples of Ethiopia, and the Issas 
are closely related to the people of the Somali 
Republic The overall population density is 
about 27 per sq.mi. (1976 est.) 

The country, consisting principally of and 
plains, IS largely devoid of water except in the s 
border region Inland Djibouti is broken by a 
senes of closed saltwater basins and mountain 
ranges n. of the Gulf of Tadjoura rising to 
heights of 5000 to 6000 ft Djibouti has a mean 
temperature of 85® F., but during the hot season 
(May to October) temperatures reach 107® F 
Annual rainfall vanes from about 5 in. on the 
coast to 20 in in the mountainous areas Agri- 
culture IS limited by the lack of water Vegeta- 
bles and dates are the mam crops The most im- 
portant agricultural occupation is the raising of 
livestock, mainly goats 

The mam industries are ship repair, construc- 
tion, salt extraction, and food processing An 
important economic activity is the transporta- 
tion of goods to and from Ethiopia via the Dji- 
bouti-Addis Ababa Railroad, a 60-mi section of 
the only railroad connecting central Ethiopia 
with the seacoast Djibouti serves as a base for 
air transport between Europe, East Africa, the 
Arabian Peninsula, and India. It was made a free 
port of call in 1949 

Legislative power in Djibouti is vested m a 40- 
member Chamber of Deputies The republic's 
chief executive Is a president, chosen by the 
chamber A cabinet, headed by a premier, is the 
principal administrative body The country be- 
longs to the United Nations, the Organization 
of African Unity, and the Arab League 

France secured an initial foothold in the re- 
gion m 1856 Treaties negotiated with Somali 
rulers between 1883 and 1887 extended French 
possessions to cover the entire Gulf of Tadjoura 
region In 1888 an agreement with Great Britain 
defined the southern boundary of the French 


protectorate its northern boundary was subse- 
quently fixed by agreements with Italy. The pro- 
tectorate became an Overseas Territory of 
France in 1946 In 1958 the population voted to 
maintain the status of an Overseas Territory Fol- 
lowing agitation by Somah nationalists, a refer- 
endum on March 19, 1%7, reaffirmed the desire 
of the population to remain within the French 
Community Independence movements contin- 
ued, however, and the strategically located 
country became independent as Djibouti on 
June 27, 1977 Hassan Couled Aptidon (1916- ) 
was chosen as the republic's first president 
AFFENPINSCHER (Ger., "monkey terrier"), 
small sturdy dog of the toy breed classification 
The fur may be black, red, or gray in color, and 
the coat is short and wiry except m the chest 
area and on the face where it becomes shaggy 
The dog's facial features mirror its namesake, 
the monkey, with pointed ears, bushy eyebrows, 
and a prominent chin tuft and mustache. The 
affenpinscher stands approximately 10 in. high 
at the shoulder and usually averages 7 to 8 lb in 
weight. It serves as a friendly pet 
AFFIDAVIT, in law, voluntary written state- 
ment sworn before an officer qualified to ad- 
minister an oath Both the person making the 
affidavit, that is, swearing to the truth of the 
facts contained m the document, and the wit- 
nessing officer, as a judge, a commissioner of 
deeds, or a notary public, are usually required to 
sign the document. Affidavits are frequently 
used in preliminary legal proceedings, for exam- 
ple, m filing, or starting, a law suit. Persons who 
swear falsely in an affidavit may incur severe le- 
gal punishment. See Deposition.

breed was known in Egypt as far back as 4000 
and 3000 bc Soldiers returning home after 
World War I introduced the breed into England, 
and It was brought to the United States about 
1931 The Afghan hound weighs about 60 lb 
and stands about 27 m high It has a narrow 
head, like that of the greyhound, a long neck, 
straight, strong forelegs, and thick, silky hair A 
hunter, the Afghan hound trails its game by 
sight The dog is especially valuable in hilly 
country because of its ability to turn easily and 
execute powerful leaps 

AFGHANISTAN (Persian Afghanistan), consti- 
tutional monarchy of central Asia until July, 
1973, when it was declared a republic in a coup 
d'etat Afghanistan is bounded on the n by the 
Turkmen, Uzbek, and Tadzhik republics of the 
U S S R ; on the n e by China, Jammu and Kash- 
mir, and Pakistan, on the SE and s by Pakistan; 
and on the w by Iran The country extends from 
about lat 29°25' N, to lat. 38°35' N and long. 
60°50' E to long. 75® E , it is roughly elliptical m 
shape and has a maximum length, from ne to 
sw, of about 900 mi and a width of about 450 
mi The area of the country is about 250,000 
sq mi , approximately the size of Texas, with 
which It also compares in geographic latitude 
THE LAND 

Afghanistan is a predominantly mountainous 
country, about three fourths of its surface con- 
sists of uplands The mam lowlands are a series 
of river valleys in the n and various desert re- 
gions to the s and sw The principal mountain 
system of the country is the Hindu Kush (q v ), 
which, with Its various offshoots, extends for 
about 600 mi from the Pamirs (q v.), a range in 
the N £ , to the borders of Iran in the w The aver- 
age altitude of the Hindu Kush is more than 
14,000 ft, seme peaks are nearly 25,000 ft. The 
highest summit of the range is Tinch Mir (25,230 
ft ), across the Pakistani border. Natural passes 
penetrate the mountains of Afghanistan at vari- 
ous points, facilitating travel within the nation 
as well as communication with neighboring 
countries In the Hindu Kush the only pass 
lower than 10,000 ft is the Shibar (9800 ft), 
which connects the Kabul region with the n 
part of the country. Probably the best known of 
the mountain passes is the histone Khyber Pass 
(q V.) on the n e border, which traverses the Su- 
laiman Range and affords relatively easy access 
to the Peshawar Province of Pakistan. 

The chief rivers of Afghanistan are the Amu- 
Dar'ya known in ancient times as the Oxus, on 
the border of the U.S.S.R; the Kabul, which 
flows into the Indus R ; the Helmand, the long- 
est river in the country, m the s, and the Han 


Rud (qq v ), m the w All of these rivers except 
the Kabul empty into lakes or swamps 
Climate. Climatic conditions in Afghanistan 
exhibit great daily and seasonal variations 
largely because of the extremes m altitude 
that characterize the country During the day 
variations in temperature may range from freez- 
ing conditions at dawn to almost 100® F at 
noon Summer temperatures as high as 120® F 
have been recorded in the n valleys. Midwinter 
temperatures as low as 15® F. are common at the 
6500-ft level in the Hindu Kush Kabul (6000 ft) 
has cold winters and pleasant summers Jalala- 
bad (1800 ft ) IS subtropical, and the climate of 
Kandahar (3500 ft ) is mild Afghanistan is a rela- 
tively dry country, the annual rainfall averaging 
about 12 in Most of the rainfall occurs between 
October and April Sandstorms occur frequently 
m the deserts and and plains 
Natural Resources. Despite the and climate 
and mountainous terrain, the natural resources 
of Afghanistan are mainly agricultural A variety 
of mineral deposits exists, but transportation 
difficulties and lack of native technical skills 
and equipment have hindered full exploitation 
of such resources. In Mazar-i-Sharif utilization 
of natural gas in the province of Shibarghan is 
being exploited 

Plants and Animals. The plant life of Afghani- 
stan resembles that of Tibet and the Himalayan 
region in general, as well as that of the Near 
Eastern plains and deserts. Forests of cedar, 
pine, and other conifers are found at elevations 
between 6(XX) and 12,000 ft As the result of 
overcuttmg, forests now occupy only about 2 
percent of the land area At lower altitudes are 
found such shrubs and trees as hazel, pistachio, 
ash, juniper, and tragacanth. Below the 3000-ft, 
level vegetation, consisting largely of herbs and 
some shrubs, is quite sparse Many varieties of 
wild flowers bloom m the spring, both in the 
mountains and on the grassy steppes Forest 
products include resin, asafetida, and pihon 
(pine nuts), as well as timber and firewood 
Among the various fruit trees are the apricot, 
peach, pear, apple, almond, and walnut Date 
palms flourish in the extreme s, and pomegran- 
ates and citrus fruits grow in the vicinity of 
Kandahar and Jalalabad Grapes and melons of 
excellent quality and unusual variety are com- 
mon. 

Indian, European, and Near Eastern fauna in- 
habit Afghanistan The dromedary and the Bac- 
trian camel abound. Indigenous wild animals in- 
clude mountain sheep, bears, ibex, gazelles, 
wolves, jackals, wildcats, hedgehogs, and foxes. 
The principal domesticated animats are sheep,

cattle, and goats, others include donkeys, 
horses, mules, and the Afghan hound (q v.), a 
breed of hunting dog The Karakul sheep of Af- 
ghanistan are famous for their pelts Waterfowl, 
pheasants, quail, and many varieties of smaller 
land and shore birds are also found 
Soils. And climate and mountainous terrain 
are mainly responsible for the relative lack of 
soil development The larger tracts of arable 
land m the fertile valleys are the only well-de- 
veloped natural resource m Afghanistan Of the 
over 5,5CX),CXX) acres of fertile soil, over 3,000,000 
are under cultivation, and approximately 2,000,- 
000 acres are under irrigation. 

Waterpower. Large-scale irrigation dams and 
hydroelectric stations are under construction 
along the major rivers. The most notable under- 
taking IS the Helmand River Valley Project, de- 
signed to provide electric power for industry 
and irrigation for more than 800,000 acres of 
land. The Mahipar and Naghiu projects on the 
Kabul R are intended to more than double the 
existing 58,000,000 kw of electric power 
THE PEOPLE 

The population, predominantly rural, may be di- 
vided into four mam ethnic groups The Pa- 
thans, or true Afghans, comprise about 60 per- 
cent of the total population, and are divided 
into two subgroups, the Duran i and Ghilzais. 
The Tajiks, of Iranian stock, make up about 30 
percent, and the remainder consists of the Uz- 
beks (5 percent) and Hazaras (3 percent) 

Social mobility has become greater in the past 
two decades. The power of family patriarchs has 
been lessened, and women have been largely 
emancipated. 

Population. A 1975 United Nations estimate 
placed the population at 19,280,000. The overall 
population density is 77 per sq.mi (1975 U N. 
est ) About 70 percent of the people live and 
work on farms, and approximately 2,500,000 still 
lead a nomadic life Only about 10 percent of 
the population live in towns of 3000 or more 
inhabitants. 

Political Divisions. For administrative pur- 
poses, Afghanistan is divided into twenty-eight 
provinces Badakhshan, Badghis, Baghlan, Baikh, 
Bamian, Farah, Faryab, Ghazni, Ghor, Helmand, 
Herat, Jouzjan, Kabul, Kandahar, Kapisa, Kunar, 
Kunduz, Laghman, Logar, Nangarhar, Nimruz, 
Parwan, Patya, Samangan, Takhar, Uruzgan, 
Wardak, and Zabul. 

Principal Cities. The capital of Afghanistan is 
Kabul (pop., 1976 est, 587,600), which, from its 
E. location, commands vital routes through the 
mountain passes Other major cities are the 
trading centers of Kandahar (pop, 1973 est. 


140,000) and Herat (pop, 1973 est, 109,000), 
known for its many ancient mosques, palaces, 
and other architectural relics, 

Reiigion. Islam is the official religion of the 
country More than 99 percent of the population 
are Muslims, mainly of the Sunni sect Most of 
the remainder, notably the Hazaras, belong to 
the Shi'ite sect Small colonies of Jews, Hindus, 
and Parsis are scattered in the towns, Mazar-i- 
Sharif IS the leading place of pilgrimage 
Language. Pashto and Persian, divisions of the 
Iranian linguistic group, are the official lan- 
guages of Afghanistan Although Pashto has 
quite an extensive literature, Persian is used for 
cultural expression and business and govern- 
ment transactions Of the many dialects spoken, 
the Turkish Uzbek, Turkoman, and Kirghiz are 
most prevalent in the border regions 
Education. Although elementary schooling is 
free and compulsory for children aged five 
through eleven, the illiteracy rate continues to 
be about 90 percent In the early 1970's, accord- 
ing to the latest available statistics, elementary 
schools had an annual enrollment of about 
621,400; secondary schools enrolled about 
172,300 annually. Institutions of higher educa- 
tion had an enrollment of some 9400 students 
The University of Kabul, founded m 1932, com- 
prises nine graduate faculties The only other 
university, Nangarhar, located m Jalalabad, has 
only a medical faculty. A polytechnic institute 
was opened in Kabul in 1968 
Libraries and Museums. The few major librar- 
ies are maintained by the government The Ka- 
bul Museum, largest m the country, is best 
known for its collection of early Buddhist relics. 
Archeology. Evidence of Stone Age man has 
been found in caves near the ancient region of 
Baikh in the N. Relics from the later Iron Age 
(after 1000 BC) have also been found in this 
area In the s.e , traces of a pottery-making peo- 
ple who flourished about 3000-2000 BC. have 
been discovered. A temple in the n.e city of 
Baghlan, dating from the 1st century BC, was 
built by the ancient Kushans 
Literature. The ancient art of storytelling con- 
tinues to flourish in Afghanistan largely as a re- 
sult of the widespread illiteracy. The Afghani- 
stan Historical Society and the Pashto Academy, 
however, publish literary magazines and en- 
courage new writers. 

Art, Music, and Sports. Afghan cultural life is 
characterized by traditional arts and pastimes. 
Cold and silver jewelry, rugs in the Persian style, 
and various leather goods are still made at 
home. Music has changed little over the years 
and is represented chiefly by traditional

ment of industry, agriculture, mining, transpor- 
tation, and social services was initiated in 1%2. 
All mineral resources are owned by the state. 
Foreign-aid grants have been received from the 
United States, West Germany, the U.SS R., and 
Communist China In a recent year the national 
budget showed revenues of about $156,000,000 
and expenditures of about $145,000,000 
About 70 percent of the population is en- 
gaged in animal husbandry or the cultivation of 
crops The two most pressing labor problems are 
widespread unemployment and a lack of skilled 
workers and administrators. 

Agriculture. Agriculture is the mam source of 
income in Afghanistan, the country usually pro- 
duces enough food products for Its own needs 
and a surplus for export The leading crops are 
cereals, garden vegetables, various fruits, and 
nuts The major industrial crops are castor 
beans, madder, asafetida, tobacco, cotton, and 
sugar beets. Sheep raising, the most important 
pastoral industry, provides large quantities of 
meat, fats, and wool for domestic consumption 
and wool and hides for export. The skin of the 
Karakul, a breed of broadtail sheep raised in 
large numbers in n Afghanistan, is highly val- 
ued The livestock population of the country 
also includes camels, horses, donkeys, cattle, 
and goats 

Mining. Since ancient times, deposits of gold, 
silver, copper, beryl, and lapis lazuli have been 
mined m small quantities in the mountainous 
areas Salt has been mined in increasing quanti- 
ties, and production now meets the needs of the 
country Coal deposits have been exploited, and 
production rose to an estimated 189,000 metric 
tons in the mid-1970"s Large natural-gas depos- 
its in N. Afghanistan are being developed with 
Soviet financing Gas began flowing to the 
USSR m the mid-1970's Other deposits, such 
as iron ore, sulfur, chrome, zinc, and uranium, 
are still largely unexploited. 

Manufacturing. During the past two decades 
manufacturing has greatly increased With the 
opening in 1%5 of a large West German-owned 
woolen mill, the woolen-textile production was 
more than doubled. Among the other factories, 
located primarily in Kabul, are plants manufac- 
turing textiles, the most important export prod- 
uct, two government-operated cement plants; a 
fruit-processmg plant, a coal-briquetting plant; 
and several cotton gins. The chief cottage indus- 
try (work done at home) is the weaving of rugs. 
Currency and Banking. The unit of currency, 
based on the silver standard, is the afghani, di- 
vided into 100 puls (45 afghanis equal U.S.$1; 
1978). The Afghan State Bank acts as the central 


bank, issues all notes, executes government 
loans, and lends money to cities and to other 
banks The Bank Melli, a privately owned com- 
mercial bank, extends credit to individuals and 
business firms Many state banks give short-term 
loans to individuals and small businesses 
ConuTierce and Trade. Most imports are con- 
trolled by the government or by government- 
controlled monopolies. Exports are largely in the 
hands of private industry. 

Principal exports are Karakul skins (sent 
chiefly to the U.S ), cotton, fruits, nuts, rugs, and 
natural gas. The leading purchasers of Afghan 
products are the Soviet Union, Great Britain, 
and India. 

The Soviet Union, japan, and India supply 
such imports as textiles, building materials, 
hardware, tea, and sugar. The U.S., West Ger- 
many, and the USSR furnish motor vehicles, 
petroleum, machinery, and cement 
Transportation. Travel within Afghanistan is 
severely limited by the rugged nature of the ter- 
rain The country has no railroads, and its nar- 
row, fast-flowing rivers are un navigable and are 
used chiefly for the logging of timber. Camels 
and other pack animals are extensively em- 
ployed for conveying goods The country has 
about 4200 mi of roads, of which about 3000 mi. 
are paved or graveled all-weather roads. Mam 
highways link Kabul with the provincial capitals 
Access to Pakistan is afforded by roads that tra- 
verse the Khyber Pass. Road maintenance is a 
constant problem in Afghanistan, mainly be- 
cause of violent spring floods. Ariana Afghan 
Airlines maintains service between the chief 
cities and neighboring countries and has flights 
to Frankfurt, Rome, and Moscow. Bakhtar Af- 
ghan Airlines serves remote areas of the country. 
Commuriications. The state-controlled tele- 
phone and telegraph lines serve all principal 
cities and are being expanded to include smaller 
towns as well Telegraphic communications 
exist among the major cities and between Kabul 
and Peshawar. In the mid-1970's about 25,000 
telephones were m use. 

Afghanistan had fifteen daily newspapers m 
the mid-1970's, and one radio broadcasting sta- 
tion, Radio Kabul, was in operation 
GOVERNMENT 

A republican constitution promulgated m Feb- 
ruary, 1977, vested broad powers in the pres- 
ident of Afghanistan, legalized only one politi- 
cal party, and established Islam as the state 
religion The constitution was suspended in 
April, 1978, following a coup d'etat, and a Revo- 
lutionary Council became the country's chief 
governing body.

Health and Welfare. The government has 
greatly increased its efforts to provide for the 
welfare of the people in recent years A program 
of preventive medicine against communicable 
diseases is well under way. Many more hospitals 
and public health clinics have been built and 
staffed, and students have been encouraged to 
enter the field of medicine 
Legislature. Legislative power is vested in a 
parliament (Shura), consisting of an upper 
house (House of the Elders) and a lower house 
(House of the People). 

Under the 1977 constitution the powers of 
both houses of parliament were considerably re- 
stricted. 

Local Government Each province is adminis- 
tered by a governor appointed by the prime 
minister and approved by parliament, and by a 
popularly elected provincial council. A Grand 
National Council (Loya Jirgah), consisting of the 
members of parliament and the chairmen of the 
provincial councils, may be convened during 
times of national crisis. It was the Loya Jirgah, 
convened on Jan 30, 1977, for the first time 
since the 1973 coup d'etat, that approved the 
new constitution and elected Mohammad Daud 
Khan (1908-78) president for a six-year term. 
Judiciary. Afghan law is based upon the con- 
stitution, legislative enactments, and the tradi- 
tional tenets of Islamic law. The judiciary con-

Defense. All male citizens from twenty to 
forty-two years of age may be conscripted into 
the army for a period of two years In peacetime 
the army numbers about 90,000 In addition, the 
country has a small air force 
HISTORY 

In ancient times the region now known as Af- 
ghanistan was the site of a culture that flour- 
ished m the 2nd millennium b.c The center of 
this civilization was Bactria (qv), where the 
Persian prophet Zoroaster (qv) is believed to 
have been active about 660 B.c. The region first 
appeared in recorded history in 516 b c, when it 
was conquered by the Persian emperor Cyrus 
the Great (q.v.) Along with the rest of the Per- 
sian Empire, the land was subjugated, about 
334-333 B.C., by the Macedonian ruler Alexander 
the Great (see Alexander III), After his death 
(323 B.c.) most of the region fell under the 
domination of the Seleucid ruler Seleucus Nica- 
tor (35B?-280 B.C) and later under that of the 
Indian king Chandragupta Sandrocottus 
(322?-298 B.C.). Later another Creek dynasty es- 
tablished itself in Bactria and founded a state 
that lasted from 246 b c. until about 130 b c The 
Creco-Bactrian state yielded in turn to Iranian 
nomads called the Sakas or Sacae and then to 
the Kushans, who adopted Buddhism (q.v) In 
the 3rd and 4th centuries A o. the Sassanian Per- 
sians invaded the country from the west The 
Ephthalites, or White Huns, were largely in con-

trol of Afghanistan when a large migration of 
Arabs swept over the region in the middle of the 
7th century 

Early Arab Period. Arab penetration affected 
Afghanistan probably more decisively than any 
previous foreign influence Centuries passed, 
however, before Islam became the dominant re- 
ligion Arab political control was superseded 
meanwhile by Persian and Turkish rule Com- 
plete Turkish ascendancy in the area was estab- 
lished late m the 10th century and early in the 
11th century by the Muslim sultan Mahmud of 
Ghazni (971?-1030). Islamic culture subse- 
quently achieved brilliant heights under the re- 
putedly native Afghan Chun dynasty 
(1148-1215) The Ghurids gradually extended 
their rule into northern India, but were over- 
whelmed by the hordes of the Mongol con- 
queror Genghis Khan (q v.), who came down 
from the north about 1220 Most of the country 
remained under Mongol control until the close 
of the 14th century, when another Mongol in- 
vader, Tamerlane (q v.), seized northern Af- 
ghanistan Among Tamerlane's most prominent 
successors was Baber (q v ), founder of the Mo- 
gul (Mongol) dynasty of India, who conquered 
Kabul about 1504 Later in the 16th century Safa- 
wids from Persia and Uzbeks from the north 
made inroads in the region However, the Per- 
sians and the Mogul successors of Baber were 
faced with continuous Afghan revolts. 

During the 17th century, the native Afghans 
began to grow in power. A Ghilzai tribe con- 
quered the Persian capital of Isfahan in 1722. 
Subsequently, a vigorous Persian counteroffen- 
sive was launched by the Persian king Nadir 
Shah (1688-1747), who in 1738 reestablished 
Persian authority over virtually all of Afghani- 
stan. Nadir was assassinated in 1747, whereupon 
the Afghan chiefs selected one of his generals, a 
member of the Abdali tribe named Ahmad Shah 
(1722?-72?), as their ruler Ahmad Shah became 
known as Durrii-Dauran ("Pearl of the Age") 
The Abdait were thus designated thereafter as 
the Durani Ahmad Shah substantially enlarged 
his realm, acquiring eastern Persia, Baluchistan, 
Kashmir, and part of the Punjab However, the 
emirate disintegrated under the succeeding rul- 
ers of his dynasty, falling m 1818. Anarchy pre- 
vailed in Afghanistan during the ensuing period 
In 1826 Dost Mohammed Khan (1793-1863), a 
member of a prominent Afghan family, seized 
control of eastern Afghanistan, assuming the ti- 
tle of emir in 1835. 

The Afghan Wars. Meanwhile, Dost Moham- 
med had appealed to British colonial authorities 
in India for support of Afghan territorial claims 


in the Punjab The British rejected his appeal, 
and Dost Mohammed turned to Russia for help 
Fearful that the Russian sphere of influence 
would be extended to the Indian frontiers, the 
British governor-general in India, George Eden, 
Earl of Auckland (1784-1849), presented Dost 
Mohammed with an ultimatum that included 
demands for the expulsion of a Russian repre- 
sentative at Kabul These British demands were 
refused, and in March, 1838, an Anglo-Indian 
army invaded Afghanistan, precipitating the 
First Afghan War (1838-42) Meeting little effec- 
tive opposition, the invaders captured Kandahar 
in April, 1839, and Ghazi the following July 
When Kabul fell on Aug. 7, Shah Shuja 
(1780?-1842), a grandson of Ahmad Shah, was 
installed on the Afghan throne in place of Dost 
Mohammed, who gave himself up to the British 

On Nov. 2, 1841, Akbar Khan (d 1849), a son 
of Dost Mohammed, led a successful revolt 
against Shah Shuja and the Anglo-Indian garri- 
sons in the country An Anglo-Indian punitive 
expedition reinforced the garrisons for a brief 
period, but in December, 1842, the British finally 
left the country. Dost Mohammed was then re- 
leased from custody and allowed to resume his 
throne. 

Relations between Afghanistan and British- 
held India remained tense until 1855, when Dost 
Mohammed concluded a peace agreement with 
the Indian government. 

Fratricidal strife among the emir's sons kept 
the country in turmoil for more than a decade 
after his death in 1863 Shere Ah Khan (1825-79), 
his son and successor, aroused the enmity of the 
British by adopting a friendly policy toward Rus- 
sia m 1878. Another British ultimatum was ig- 
nored, and in November, 1878, Anglo-Indian 
forces again invaded Afghanistan In the course 
of the ensuing conflict, known as the Second 
Afghan War (1878-79), the Afghans suffered a 
series of severe reversals Kabul was occupied m 
October, 1879, Yakub Khan (1849-1923), son of 
Shere Ali who had succeeded to the throne m 
the preceding March, was forced to abdicate, 
and, in 1880, Abd-er-Rahman Khan 
(1830? -1901), grandson of Dost Mohammed, 
was placed on the throne. The new ruler con- 
firmed the cession, previously arranged with the 
British by Yakub Khan, of the Khyber Pass and 
other Afghan territories During his reign, which 
lasted until 1901, Abd-er-Rahman Khan adjusted 
boundary disputes with India and Russia, cre- 
ated a standing army, and curbed the power of 
various tribal chieftains 

In 1907, during the reign of Habibullah Khan 
(1872-1919), the son and successor of Abd-er-

Habibullah was assassinated In February, 1919 
His brother Nasruliah Khan, who held the 
throne for only six days, was deposed by the 
Afghan nobility in favor of Amanullah Khan 
(1892-1960), a nephew of Habibullah. Deter- 
mined to remove his country completely from 
the British sphere of influence, Amanullah de- 
clared war on Great Britain m May, 1919 The 
British, faced at the same time with the growing 
Indian liberation movement, negotiated a peace 

214 


treaty with Afghanistan the following August By 
the terms of this agreement, concluded at Ra- 
walpindi, Great Britain recognized Afghanistan 
as a sovereign and independent nation In 1926 
Amanullah Khan changed his title from ''emir" 
to '"king". 

The New Kingdom. The popularity and pres- 
tige which King Amanullah had won through 
his handling of the British were soon to be dissi- 
pated. Deeply impressed by the modernization 
programs of Iran and Turkey, he instituted a se- 
ries of political, social, and religious reforms in 
his kingdom. Constitutional rule was inaugu- 
rated (1923), the titles of the nobility were abol- 
ished, education for women was decreed, and 
other sweeping measures aimed at the modern- 



AFGHANISTAN 


ization of traditional institutions were enforced 
The profound hostility provoked in influential 
circles in Afghanistan by the king's reform pro- 
gram led, in 1929, to rebellion, and Amanullah 
quickly abdicated and went into exile. His 
brother Inayatullah, who succeeded him, was 
deposed, after a reign of three days, by Bacha 
Sakau, a rebel leader In October, 1929, Amanul- 
lah's uncle. Nadir Shah (1880-1933), with the 
support of several thousand tribesmen, defeated 
the forces of Bacha Sakau, who was captured 
and executed The Afghan crown was then be- 
stowed on Nadir Shah 

The new ruler gradually restored order in the 
kingdom In 1932 he initiated a program of eco- 
nomic reforms, but he was assassinated the fol- 
lowing year His son and successor, Zahir Shah 
(1914- ), nineteen years old at the time of his 
accession, was dominated for the next thirty 
years by his uncles and cousins, particularly by 
his cousin and later brother-in-law. Prince Mo- 
hammad Daud Khan (1908-78), who served as 
premier from 1953 to 1%3 The government in- 
tensified the modernization program begun by 
Nadir Shah and established close commercial 
relations with Germany, Italy, and Japan Zahir 
Shah proclaimed neutrality at the outbreak of 
World War 11, however, in 1941, at the request of 
Great Britain and the Soviet Union, more than 
200 German and Italian agents were expelled 
from the country The United States established 
diplomatic relations with Afghanistan in 1942, In 
November, 1946, Afghanistan became a member 
of the United Nations. 

International Events. The Afghan government 
closely scrutinized the events attendant upon 
the establishment m 1947 of India and Pakistan 
as independent states. Of particular concern 
was the incorporation into Pakistan of the 
North-West Frontier Province (q v ) Tribal Areas, 
a neighboring region largely populated by Pa- 
thans Pakistan ignored Afghan demands for a 
plebiscite in the Tribal Areas on the question of 
self-determination In retaliation, Afghanistan 
voted (1947) against the admission of Pakistan 
to the U N Relations between the two countries 
continued to be strained during the next several 
years Sporadic frontier clashes occurred be- 
tween Pakistani forces and Pathan tribesmen, 
especially after 1949, when the latter, with the 
approval of the Afghan government, launched a 
movement to establish an independent state to 
be called Pashtunistan or Pathanistan 

Afghanistan manifested displeasure over a 
U S -Pakistan military-aid pact concluded m 
1954 The following year Soviet Premier Nikolai 
A Bulganin (q.v ), visiting Afghanistan, pro- 


claimed support for a state of Pashtunistan Sub- 
sequently the U S S.R and Afghanistan issued a 
joint statement advocating peaceful coexis- 
tence, universal disarmament, and U N mem- 
bership for Communist China The Soviet gov- 
ernment simultaneously extended technical-aid 
loans to Afghanistan 

Relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan 
improved briefly during the late 1950's In 1%1, 
however, the Pashtunistan dispute again flared 
up, and diplomatic relations were broken off, 
not to be fully restored until 1%7 

In 1963 King Zahir removed Mohammad 
Daud as premier and took full control of the 
reins of government In 1964 Afghanistan be- 
came a member of the Colombo Plan for Coop- 
erative Economic Development in South and 
Southeast Asia A new constitution providing for 
a more liberal form of government became ef- 
fective in October, 1964, simultaneously, parlia- 
ment was dissolved The first legislative elec- 
tions under the new constitution were held in 
September, 1%5 

In 1966 the Afghan ambassador to the U N , 
Abdul Rahman Pazhwak (1919- ), was elected 
president of the General Assembly for the 
twenty-first session 

In the Arab-lsraeli War of 1%7 (see Middle 
East) and subsequent disputes, particularly m 
regard to the Israeli occupation of old Jerusa- 
lem, Afghanistan generally supported the Arabs 

Despite efforts at reform and modernization 
in the late 1960's, Afghanistan remained in seri- 
ous economic difficulties The situation was 
worsened by three years of drought, during 
which 80,000 persons are believed to have died 
of starvation By 1973 aid from the Soviet Union 
had reached $1,500,000,000, from the U.S , 
$425,000,000, and from China, $72,000,000 

In 1%8 King Zahir had made overtures to 
Daud, and a degree of harmony was believed to 
have been restored On July 17, 1973, however, 
while the king was vacationing abroad, Daud 
declared martial law, proclaimed Afghanistan a 
republic, and vowed to replace the ''corrupt" 
government of Zahir with "genuine democ- 
racy" 

A new constitution was approved in early 
1977, and Daud was elected to the powerful 
post of president. He appointed a civilian cabi- 
net and maintained the country's policy of non- 
alignment In April, 1978, Daud was killed dur- 
ing a violent coup d'etat. The new rulers, 
organized in a Revolutionary Council led by 
Noor Mohammad Taraki (1917?- ), suspended 
the constitution and promised to raise general 
living standards

AFRICA, the second-largest continent, with 
adjacent islands covers about 20 percent of the 
total land area m the world Estimates of its size 
range from 11,300,000 sq mi to 12,563,000 sq.mi 
Africa IS bounded by the Strait of Gibraltar on 
the N,w, the Mediterranean Sea on the n., the 
Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden on the n e, the 
Indian Ocean on the e, the Indian and Atlantic 
oceans on the s , and the Atlantic Ocean on the

Cape Vert in Senegal (long 17®30' W ), to Ras 
Hafun, near Cape Guardafui in Somalia (long 
51 °25' E ), IS 4700 mi Latitudmally, the continent 
IS almost equally divided between the Northern 
and Southern hemispheres and lies almost en- 
tirely within the tropics Because of the west Af- 
rican bulge, the greater part of the area of the 
continent lies n of the equator. The highest 
point on the continent is Mt Kilimanjaro, 19,340 
ft , in Tanzania, and the lowest point is the Qat- 
tara Depression, a rugged valley 436 ft below 
sea level, in the Arab Republic of Egypt, 

Africa has an extremely regular coastline with 
a total length of only 18,950 mi. Because of the 
relatively small number of large gulfs, bays, or 
other coastal indentations, the length of the 
coastline is proportionately less than that of any 
other continent. Major bays or promontories in- 
clude, m addition to those already cited, the

(q V.) in the n w., the terrain of Africa consists of 
a vast plateau Although the plateau appears to 
be rolling, it is marked by a number of large, 
saucer-shaped basins Despite the uniformity of 
vast areas, several regions have highly distinctive 
features 

Principal Regions. Africa may be divided into 
three major regions, namely the Northern Pla- 
teau, the Central and Southern Plateau, and the 
Eastern Highlands. The outstanding feature of 
the Northern Plateau is the Sahara (qv.), the 
great desert that extends from the Atlas Mts and 
the Atlantic coast to the Red Sea and that occu- 
pies more than one quarter of the entire conti- 
nent The Sudan region, some 2,000,000 sq.m I m 
area and extending from the w. African coast to 
the Eastern Highlands, occupies the s. portion of 
the Northern Plateau. This area consists of grassy 
flatlands and well-watered plains The Central 
and Southern Plateau is considerably higher 
than the Northern Plateau and occupies the en- 
tire region w of the Eastern Highlands, The East- 
ern Highlands, highest portion of the continent, 
lie near the E. coast, extending from the Zam- 
bezi River (q v ) northward to the Red Sea The 
Drakensberg Mountains (q.v) may be consid- 
ered a southern spur of these highlands. The ta- 
bleland bordering the Red Sea and a high pla- 
teau jutting into the Somali Peninsula are 
regarded as spurs of the Eastern Highlands 
Relief. The elevation of the African plateau in- 
creases from N.w. to s e., the average being 
about 1900 ft Coastal strips, with the exception 
of the Mediterranean coast and the Guinea

coast, are generally narrow and rise sharply to 
the plateau 

In N Africa, the Atlas Mts., a chain of rugged 
peaks linked by high plateaus, run from Mo- 
rocco into Tunisia The highest point is Djebel 
Toubkal (13,665 ft.) in sw. Morocco. The mam 
highlands in the Northern Plateau are the Tibesti 
Mts, of the central Sahara, which reach a maxi- 
mum elevation of 11,204 ft The Qattara Depres- 
sion IS the lowest point of the region, 436 ft 
below sea level In the Sudan region the most 
prominent highlands are the Futa Jallon, the 
Adamawa Massif, and the Cameroon mountain 
range, which reaches a maximum elevation of 
13,350 ft at Mt Cameroon To the n is the Lake 
Chad basin The Central and Southern Plateau 
contains several major depressions, notably the 
Congo River basin and the Kalahari Desert 
(q.v). Other features of this plateau, which av- 
erages more than 3000 ft in elevation, are Maka- 
lakari and Ngami, saline basins, the Drakensberg 
range, running some 700 mi m a n to s direc- 
tion, and, in the extreme s , the Karoo (q.v ), an 
arid plateau covering more than 100,000 sq mi 

Much of the Eastern Highlands has an average 
elevation of more than 5000 ft, in the Ethiopian 
Plateau it rises to levels of 6000 ft., 8000 ft., and 
10,000 ft Ras Dashan (15,157 ft) is the highest 
peak of the plateau. South of the plateau are a 
number of towering volcanic peaks, including 
Mt. Kilimanjaro; Mt Kenya (17,058 ft.); and Mt

Elgon (14,178 ft) A distinctive topographical 
feature is the system of rift valleys that traverses 
the highlands in a n to s direction This system, 
a result of subsidence of the terrain between 
parallel cracks in the crust of the earth, com- 
prises a senes of narrow, elongated depressions 
with steep walls West of the rift valleys is the 
Ruwenzori (q v ), a mountain range between 
lakes Albert and Edward, which attains a maxi- 
mum elevation of 16,795 ft

Drainage. Six major drainage networks exist in 
Africa, with the exception of the Lake Chad ba- 
sin, all have outlets to the sea and all are cut by 
steep cataracts or rapids that impede navigation 
The Nile River (q v ), with a length of 4132 mi., is 
the longest river in the world Formed from the 
Blue Nile, originating at Lake Tana in Ethiopia, 
and the White Nile, originating at Lake Victoria, 
the Nile flows w and n before emptying into 
the Mediterranean Sea Its major tributaries are 
the "Atbara, Bahr al-Ghazal, and Sobat The Con- 
go River (q v ), some 2900 mi long, originates m 
Zambia and flows n , w , and s to dram into the 
Atlantic Ocean Its mam tributaries are the Kasai 
and the Ubangi The third-longest African river, 
the Niger, is about 2600 mi long, although its 
upper portions are navigable only during rainy 
seasons The Niger rises in the Futa Jallon and 
flows N and e before turning s to empty into 

218 


the Gulf of Guinea Its chief tributary is the Be- 
nue R The Zambezi R, about 2200 mi long, 
originates m Zambia and flows s and e to emp- 
ty into the Indian Ocean The Luangwa and Ka- 
fue rivers are its mam tributaries The Zambezi is 
cut by various rapids, the most spectacular of 
which IS Victoria Falls (q v ) The Orange R, 
with Its tributary, the Vaal, has a length of about 
1300 mi It rises m the Drakensberg Mountains 
of Lesotho and flows w to the Atlantic Lake 
Chad, a freshwater lake with an average depth 
of about 4 ft, drams nearby rivers and consti- 
tutes the largest inland drainage area on the 
continent Other significant river systems in- 
clude the Senegal and Volta m w Africa, and the 
Limpopo in s Africa 

The rift valleys of the Eastern Highlands form 
the basins of the equatorial lake system Among 
the rift-valiey lakes are Nyasa (see Malawi, 
Lake), Tanganyika, Rudolf (Turkana), Edward 
(qq V ), and Albert Lake Victoria, the largest lake 
m Africa and the third largest m the world, oc- 
cupies a shallow depression m the highlands 
Geology. In general, the geological structure 
of Africa exhibits simplicity and uniformity, 
characterized by a basal complex of crystalline 
rocks supporting sediments laid down m Paleo- 
zoic, Mesozoic, and Cenozoic times (geological 
periods stretching from 570,000,000 to about 
38,000,000 years ago) Strata of recent deposition

gneisses, schists, and granite, which may be 
classed as Archean or Precambnan (4,0CX),000,- 
000 to 570,000,000 years old) Outcroppings of 
Precambnan rock occupy about 57 percent of 
the continental area, in other areas tilted, 
eroded horizontal beds of sandstones and slates 
overlie the basal complex In s Africa these beds 
contain rich deposits of gold and other miner- 
als Extensive Devonian beds (395,000,000 to 
345,000,000 years old), in which marine fossils 
are found, also occur in s Africa and in the Sa- 
hara and Sudan regions Carboniferous strata 
(345,000,000 to 280,000,000 years old) containing 
rich coal seams are widespread in the southern, 
southeastern, eastern, and central portions of 
the continent East-central Africa, particularly 
the Somali and Tanzanian regions, has extensive 
Jurassic deposits (190,000,000 to 136,000,000 
years old), notably limestone, some of which are 
rich in reptilian and marine fossils 
The continental terrain displays considerable 
evidence of ancient volcanic activity of extreme 
violence, especially in the e and s e uplifts Vol- 
canic activity was probably most intense during 
the Jurassic period, the estimated time of subsi- 
dence of a continental area (known in geology 
as Gondwanaland) believed to have connected 
Africa to South America, India, Australia, and 
Antarctica Thermal phenomena still occur in 
Kenya and Tanzania, and in the region e of Lake 
Victoria many extinct volcanic cones and craters 
exist The diamond mines of South Africa, the 
richest diamond-bearing region in the world, 
are located in the vents of old volcanoes 


Geologically, the Atlas Mts are a part of the 
Eurasian landmass The system is composed of 
eruptives, including trachyte and basalt along 
the N edge, with mterfoliated gneisses, schists, 
granite, and limestone, as well as Carboniferous, 
Jurassic, and Triassic sediments (dating from 
345,CXX),(XX) to 1 36,CXX),0CX) years ago) 

Climate. More than any other continent, Af- 
rica IS distinguished by the general uniformity 
of Its climatic phenomena, this results from the 
position of the continent m the tropical zone, 
with the equator bisecting it, the impact of cool 
ocean currents, and the absence of mountain 
chains serving as climatic barriers 

Seven mam African climatic zones may be 
distinguished The central portion of Africa, 
above and below the equator, is a tropical rain 
forest climate zone Here, particularly in the 
Congo basin, which is constantly hot and moist, 
the average temperature is 80° F No true dry 
season exists, although some months have less 
rainfall than others The climate zone of the E 
African and Guinea coasts resembles the equa- 
torial climate, except that rainfall comes mainly 
in one season, no months, however, are rainless, 
and there is no true dry season 

The tropical savanna climate zone includes 
more than one third of Africa Here the climate 
has three distinct phases a cool, dry season, a 
hot, dry season, and a hot, wet season Total 
rainfall vanes from 20 m on the desert margins

to 80 ID in areas in which the savanna climate 
merges with that of the equatorial region The 
zone of low-latitude deserts and flatiands has a 
three-season climate, but total rainfall is under 
20 in , resulting in desert or semidesert condi- 
tions Moisture-laden air masses seldom pene- 
trate into the N region of Africa, and when such 
air masses do move inland, little moisture is de- 
posited In the Sahara, extremes of temperature 
are great, sun temperatures of 170° F may be 
reached, but shade temperatures as high as 136° 
F are said to have been recorded During the 
cold season, however, the temperature often 
drops below freezing, frost is quite common, 
and the coldest month has a mean temperature 
below 50° F Other notable and regions include 
the Kalahari Desert and the Namib Desert of s 
Africa 

Mediterranean climate zones are found in the 
extreme n w of Africa and m the extreme sw 
Rainfall occurs during the winter months in 
these regions The mountain or highland climate 
zones are, on the whole, equable and temper- 
ate In E Africa, particularly in Kenya and 
Uganda, rainfall is well distributed throughout

teau of South Africa is temperate, with tempL 
tures ranging from about 50° F m winter to 
about 68° F in summer, the winters are dry and

Plant and Animal Life. Africa is well known 
for Its diverse vegetation as well as the variety of 
Its animal life, particularly big-game animals 
Plants African vegetation can be classified ac- 
cording to rainfall and humidity zones The 
tropical ram forest zone, where the average an- 
nual rainfall is more than 50 in, has a dense 
surface covering of shrubs, ferns, and mosses 
above which tower evergreens, oil palms, and 
hardwood trees, such as mahogany and ebony 
some of which reach heights of 150 ft or more’ 
A mountain forest zone, with average annual 
rainfall only slightly less than m the tropical ram 
forests, IS found in the high mountains of Cam- 
eroon, Angola, E Africa, and parts of Ethiopia. 
Here a ground covering of shrubs gives way to 
oil palms, hardwood trees, and primitive com- 
fers 

A woodland zone, with annual rainfall of 55 
in to 35 in , covers vast areas with a layer of 
grass and fire-resistant shrubs, above which are 
to be found deciduous and leguminous fire-re- 
sistant trees A wooded grassland zone, with an- 
nual rainfall of 35 in to 20 m , is covered by low

grasses and shrubs and scattered, small decidu- 
ous trees The thornbush zone, with an annual 
rainfall of 20 in to 12 in, has a thinner grass 
covering and a scattering of succulent or 
semisucculent trees, notably the baobab, eu- 
phorbia, and acacia 

The subdesert scrub zone, with an annual 
rainfall of 12 m to 5 m , has a covering of 
grasses and scattered low shrubs The zone of 
desert vegetation, found in areas with an annual 
rainfall of less than 5 in , has sparse vegetation 
or none at all Desert grasses, thorny shrubs, des- 
ert bushes, and date palms grow near oases, 
elsewhere, small plants with deep root systems 
predominate A variety of short-lived plants 
spring up after desert rainfalls from seeds that 
lie dormant between storms 

Other forms of vegetation include the sudd, a 
mass of floating papyrus, reeds, and other water 
plants found in the Sudanese Nile, swamps and 
mangrove forests found along the coasts of w 
and east-central Africa, thick growths of water- 
retaining shrubs found in n w Africa and m the 


Cape of Good Hope region, and mountain 
vegetation, such as tussock grasses, found in 
areas of E Africa and Ethiopia above 10,000 ft 
Animals Africa has two distinct zones of ani- 
mal life the North and Northwestern zone, in- 
cluding the Sahara, and the Ethiopian zone, in- 
cluding all of Africa S of the Sahara The North 
and Northwestern zone is characterized by ani- 
mal life similar to that of Eurasia Sheep, goats, 
horses, and camels are common domestic ani- 
mals Barbary sheep, African red deer, and two 
types of ibex are native to the n African coast 
Desert foxes are found in the Sahara along with 
gazelles, hares, and the jerboa, a small leaping 
rodent. The Ethiopian zone is famous for its va- 
riety of distinctive animals and birds Woodland 
and grassland areas are inhabited by numerous 
species of antelope and deer, zebra, giraffe, buf- 
falo, the African elephant, warthog and other 
species of pig, rhinoceros, and the baboon and

and new diseases, notably rinderpest, have seri- 
ously depleted a variety of African animal spe-

Natural Resources. Africa has a surprising va- 
riety of mineral and hydrologic resources, which 
are beginning to be systematically exploited 
The soil, however, upon which the bulk of Afri- 
cans must rely for subsistence is of uneven qual- 
ity 

Soils Because much of the continent has been 
above water for millions of years, soils have de- 
veloped locally and few areas have benefited 


226 



from transported soils brought by rivers or 
ocean currents The mineral fragments in Afri- 
can soils are angular and jagged, unlike those m 
transported soils, and the splintery fragments 
cause rapid wear to plows and other farming 
implements 

Whenever African soils developed on sedi- 
mentary rocks, such as sandstones and shales, 
they resemble soils of other regions, but where 
they developed on ancient metamorphic rocks, 
weathering takes place to varied depths, drain- 
age IS irregular, and no definite water table ex- 
ists The laterite soils of Africa are relatively in- 
fertile, some forming bncklike masses when dry 
Heavy rainfall and high temperatures leach min- 
erals from such soil and lead to more rapid de- 
pletion of fertility In addition, heavy down- 
pours result m serious erosion Because the 
natural processes of leaching and sedimentation 
result m the formation of hardpan at varying 
distances from the surface, root formation of 
plants IS often limited African soils as a whole 
are not naturally rich in either organic or inor- 
ganic plant nutrients Humus is easily lost by ex- 
posure to the atmosphere, and, consequently, a 
single deep plowing may dissipate many of the 
nutrients contained in the soil Desert soils are 
unproductive except m oases or irrigated areas 
and when an effort is made to reduce their sa- 
linity The most fertile African soils include the 
chernozems and black soils of e Africa and the 
"'prairie'' soils of portions of w and s. Africa 
These soils are found in areas of moderate rain- 
fall 

Minerals Most of the known minerals of the 
world are present in Africa, many in significant 
quantities Fossil fuels exist in abundance, al-

River near Akosombo, Ghana, is a major source of hy-

has major deposits of antimony, beryllium, cad- 
mium, and mercury Among the precious met- 
als, Africa has more than half the known re- 
serves of gold. South Africa, followed by 
Rhodesia, Zaire, and Ghana, are the major pro- 
ducers Platinum occurs in massive deposits in 
South-West Africa, tantalum and niobium in 
Zaire, zirconium in Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra 
Leone, South Africa, and the Nile delta, germa- 
nium in Zaire and South-West Africa, and lith- 
ium in Rhodesia The mines of South Africa and 
Zaire yield virtually the entire world supply of 
gem and industrial diamonds Phosphates are 
concentrated in n and w Africa, with major 
potash deposits in the People's Republic of the 
Congo and Ethiopia Other minerals found in 
Africa m exploitable quantities include clays, 
mica, sulfur, salt, natron, graphite, limestone, 
and gypsum 

Water A major problem of Africa is that of 
achieving effective control of water Huge areas 
suffer low rainfall and need water for irrigation 
Still larger areas receive only irregular rainfall 
and must store water as insurance against de- 
layed or deficient rams On the other hand, 
some regions must cope with too much water 
great swamps exist, which could be drained to 
increase arable land, and vast areas suffer from 
periodic flooding Underground storage of wa-

ter IS difficult, and the water table is usually ir- 
regular 

Because much of the rainfall in Africa is sea- 
sonal and many rivers flow only during the rainy 
season, there are shortages of surface water This 
has led to the use of groundwater, particularly m 
the desert and semidesert portions of the conti- 
nent In recent years, various dams and reser- 
voirs have been constructed to channel water 
for irrigation and for hydroelectric power Major 
irrigation projects predominate in n Africa, 
Egypt, and the Sudan The Aswan High Darn 
(q V ), astride the Nile, provides immense hydro- 
electric power and regulates the flow of water 
for the Nile delta Furthers the Sennar Dam on 
the Blue Nile provides regular water supplies for 
the extensive irrigation projects of the Gezira 
area of the Sudan Below the Sahara, irrigation 
projects have been developed utilizing the Ni- 
ger and Orange rivers 

Much of the effort, however, has focused on 
tapping the energy potential of the river sys- 
tems The numerous rivers of Africa and the 
abrupt descents of the waterways have led to 
estimates that the continent has some 40 per- 
cent of world hydroelectric potential Notable 
power projects include Owen Falls Dam on the 
Nile at Lake Victoria, Kariba Dam on the Zam- 
bezi between Zambia and Rhodesia, the com- 
plex of dams on the Congo and its tributaries, 
the Volta R project in Ghana, Cabora Bassa dam 
on the Zambezi in Mozambique, and Kainji 
Dam on the Niger R in Nigeria Various other 






hydroelectric projects were under construction 
in the mid-1970's These included a major com- 
plex on the Cunene R in sw Africa 
Although most efforts to utilize African water 
resources have been national, several regional 
organizations have been created to further de- 
velopment of these resources Among the most 
prominent of these intergovernmental agencies 
are the Organization for the Development of 
the Senegal River, and the Niger River Commis- 
sion 

THE PEOPLE 

The peoples of Africa are classified into five ma- 
jor groups, based on such characteristics as skin 
color, hair type, and physical stature The Bush- 
manoid peoples, thought to be among the earli- 
est inhabitants of Africa, are now concentrated 
in sw Africa and in several isolated pockets in 
Tanzania The Bushmen and Hottentots are the 
sole surviving representatives of this group 
They have light yellowish-brown skin, which 
tends to be extremely wrinkled, short, black, so- 
called peppercorn hair, and a short stature The 
average height of an adult male Bushman is 
about 5 ft and that of a Hottentot male about 5 
ft 3 in The women are noted for protruding 
buttocks (steatopygia) Pygmoid peoples are 
now found almost entirely m the ram forests of 
the Congo basin They have intermarried exten- 
sively with Negroid peoples, but those who 
have been least affected by contact are charac- 
terized by brownish skin, black, kinky hair, and 
height averaging about 4 ft 9 m in adult males 


Dogon tribesmen in Mali perform a funeral dance As 
the elaborate headdresses suggest, the tribe is known 
for skill in carving Wendy Watnss-Woodfm Camp & Associates 

The Negroid peoples of Africa are the most nu- 
merous and the most widely spread throughout 
the continent In physical characteristics they 
vary greatly In w and central Africa, skin color 
tends toward dark brown or black, in e and s 
Africa It IS a lighter brown Negroid hair is most 
frequently black and kinky Stature varies from 
about 5 ft 8 m among the Mande of the west- 
ern grasslands, to a shorter stature on the 
Guinea coast, to about 5 ft 10 m among the 
Nilotic peoples of e Africa The Caucasoid peo- 
ples of Africa inhabit the area above the Sahara, 
Ethiopia, and the e African Horn (modern So- 
malia) Related to Mediterranean Caucasoids, 
they are taller and somewhat more narrow- 
headed Their skin color ranges from very light 
brown to almost black, hair varies from wavy or 
occasionally straight to curly or kinky, stature 
ranges from about 5 ft 8 m among Galla to 5 ft 
5 m among Berber peoples Mongoloid peoples 
are concentrated on the island of Madagascar 
The most recent group, these peoples are 
thought to be descendants of 5th- and 6th-cen- 
tury Indonesian settlers, they have yellowish- 
brown skin, straight black hair, and an average 
height of about 5 ft 2 m among adult males 
In addition to racial classification, people can 
be grouped by cultural or ethnic differences 
More than 3000 distinct ethnic groups have 
been classified m Africa Most of the tribes or 


229 


AFRICA 


peoples find their origins in the extended fam- 
ily, which consists of several generations linked 
along either a male or female line, and their 
own nuclear families The family is usually led 
by a senior male Except among the Berbers and 
the Coptic Christians of Ethiopia, polygyny is 
the traditional ideal, although it is limited by the 
wealth or status of the husband Payment of a 
bride-pnce, by which the groom compensates 
the bride's parents for the loss of their daughter, 
IS common throughout the continent In much 
of Africa the family is linked to a larger society 
through km groups such as lineages and clans 
Km groups generally tend to exclude marriage 
among their members, and members marry 
outside the group The village is frequently a 
single km group united by either male or female 
descent 

Demography. Although Africa covers about 
one fifth of the total world land surface, it has 
only one tenth the population In the mid-1970's 
the total population of the continent was esti- 
mated at about 365,000,000 Average density, 
some 36 people per sq mi , is considerably lower 
than the world average of 66 This reflects the 
fact that large areas, such as the Sahara and 
Kalahari, are virtually uninhabitable When the 
population living on arable or productive land is 
calculated, the average density increases to 
some 260 persons per sq mi Density vanes 
greatly over the continent, with the most 
densely settled areas along the n and w coasts, 
along the Nile, Niger, Congo, and Senega! river 
basins, and m the e African plateau from the 
lakes to the Ethiopian Plateau Nigeria, with a 
population of 79,760,000, is the most populous 
nation in Africa 

The African birthrate averages more than 46 
per 1000 persons (By contrast, the birthrate m 
Europe is about 10 per 1000 ) The spread of 
medical services and better foods is primarily 
responsible for a sharp decrease in the death 
rate, which averages about 21 per 1000 Popula- 
tion growth, therefore, is slightly higher than 25 
per 1000, and the age distribution is weighted 
heavily toward the young In most African 
countries, some 46 percent of the population is 
fifteen years of age or younger 

The African population, despite the early 
growth of towns, has always been predomi- 
nantly rural. About one fifth of the population 
lives m towns of more than 20,000 inhabitants 
Northern Africa is the most urbanized region, 
but major cities are located in every part of the 
continent Cairo, Alexandria, Casablanca, Kin- 
shasa, Lagos, and Johannesburg all have popula- 
tions of more than 1,000,000 Although these 


and other urban centers grow through natural 
increase, the towns act as magnets attracting 
large numbers of rural migrants who come 
either as permanent settlers or as short-term 
workers 

In addition to internal rural-to-urban migra- 
tion, Africa has had significant international 
migrations In the days of the slave trade, an 
estimated 10,000,000 Africans were drawn into 
the Atlantic trade, and millions of others were 
seized for Asian markets In modern times, 
substantial labor migration developed, particu- 
larly of Africans from central Africa to the mines 
and factories of Zambia, Rhodesia, and South 
Africa, and of North Africans to France and, 
more recently, to the countries belonging to the 
European Economic Community (q.v ) Wars, 
particularly m the Sudan, Rwanda, and Burundi, 
have led to massive refugee migrations, and the 
drought and famine of the early 1970's displaced 
hundreds of thousands from the affected areas 
below the Sahara 

Few Europeans migrated to Africa except to 
the temperate areas along the n African coast, 
the E African highlanas, and s Africa In these 
areas dominant white settler societies devel- 
oped Asians, primarily from the Indian subcon- 
tinent, settled in e and s Africa, Lebanese and 
other Middle Eastern peoples established them- 
selves in w and central Africa Both groups are 
primarily urban dwellers engaged in commerce 
or the professions The inflow of European and 
Asian peoples was the result of colonialism, and 
with the reestablishment of independent Afri- 
can states, white and Asian settler populations 
have declined

Religion. The majority of African peoples 
practice indigenous or local religions Although 
these are of wide variety, they tend to have a 
single god or creator figure and a number of 
subordinate spirits — nature spirits who inhabit 
trees, water, animals, and other natural phe- 
nomena, and ancestral spirits such as founders 
of the family, lineage, or clan — who affect 
everyday life Contact with these spirits occurs 
generally through the intercession of a variety 
of ritual authorities, such as priests and family 
elders, who tend to work for good ends, and 
witches and sorcerers, who serve vengeful pur- 
poses. See Religion Primitive Religions 

Islam, the second most widespread religion in 
Africa, was introduced throughout n Africa in 
the 7th century and in following centuries was 
spread by conquerors, traders, and nomadic 
Muslim groups along the e African coast and

through the grasslands of w Africa In the 20th 
century, Islam has penetrated into the re- 
maining portions of the continent The earliest 
of the Muslim schools of law, the Maliki, pre- 
vails over most of Muslim Africa except m Egypt, 
the Horn, and the e African coast 

Christianity, the third most widespread reli- 
gion, was introduced into n Africa in the 1st 
century and spread to the Sudan and Ethiopian 
regions in the 4th century Monophysite Christi- 
anity survived irj Ethiopia through the Coptic 
Church, but in the other areas and in n Africa, 
Christianity was swept away by Islam It re- 
turned and spread through tropical Africa with 
the 15th-century rise of European overseas ex- 
pansion. Today Protestant and Catholic groups 
are about equally represented throughout the 
continent 

Small numbers of Jews are located in n and s 
Africa, and Hindu, Buddhist, and Taoist peoples 
are scattered through e and s Africa 

Arising primarily from Christianity are certain 
nativistic religious movements, which tend to 
fuse orthodox Christian rites and beliefs with 
tribal religious elements Led by individual 
prophets, these separatist groups have spread 
throughout Africa, although they appear most 
widespread and powerful m s and central

ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT 
Traditionally, the vast majority of Africans have 
been farmers and herdsmen who raised foods 
and livestock for subsistence Few markets ex- 
isted, and trade usually took place between 
relatives and friends Manufacturing and crafts 
were carried on as part-time activities A few 
states developed long-distance trade systems, 
and here complex exchange facilities as well as 
industrial specialization, communication net- 
works, and elaborate governmental structures 
maintained the flow of commerce 

With European colonization came taxes, 
which usually had to be paid in money, demand 
for certain agricultural and mineral products; 
labor migration, new and safe communication 
systems, and European techniques and crops 
Local industries and crafts — textiles and iron- 
making, for example — were undermined by 
cheaper or better European goods Processing 
industries developed, as did ports and adminis- 
trative centers A variety of consumer industries 
sprang up to fill new consumer needs Depend- 
ing upon investment funds, the need to process 


or produce items from local raw materials 
availability of energy sources, and the size of 
local markets, African colonies and, later, na- 
tions were poised for more substantial eco- 
nomic development 

Despite the growth of commerce and indus- 
try, most Africans remain farmers and herdsmen 
In N and nw Africa, wheat, oats, corn, and 
barley are the important gram crops Dates, 
olives, and citrus fruits are the mam tree crops, a 
variety of vegetables is grown Goats and sheep 
are the most significant livestock raised In the 
Sahara region, nomadic herdsmen raise camels, 
and a few farmers, situated m oases, grow dates 
and grams South of the Sahara, shifting agricul- 
ture, m which small areas were burned, cleared, 
and planted, then allowed to revert to bush, has 
given way to settled farming Crains are the 
mam crops outside the ram forests, rice, yams, 
manioc, okra, plantains, and bananas are raised 
for food Outside tsetse fly areas and dense 
forests, cattle are raised m large numbers, but 
rarely for commercial purposes Dairy farming is 
limited 

Commercial or cash-crop farming is common 
throughout Africa Foodstuffs are grown for 
local urban markets, but coffee, cotton, cocoa, 
peanuts, palm oil, and tobacco are grown by 
Africans for export European-owned planta- 
tions, found mainly m s Africa, concentrate on 
citrus, tobacco, and rubber 

Logging IS concentrated in ram-forest areas, 
where mahogany, ebony, and other furniture 
woods are found, and m temperate forests, 
where cork, cedar, and camphor bark are cut 
Inland fishing is concentrated in the rift-valley 
lakes and in scattered fish farms Ocean fishing 
is commercially important off Morocco and 
South Africa 

Mineral extraction, including the production 
of oil, provides the bulk of export earnings, and 
extractive industries are the most developed 
sectors m most African economies 

Stemming from mineral and petroleum ex- 
traction are processing industries, such as refin- 
ing and smelting, which are located m most 
mmeral-rich countries with adequate energy 
sources About 90 percent of manufacturing on 
the continent is carried on m South Africa. 
Heavy industry, such as metal-producing, ma- 
chine-making, and transport-manufacturing, is 
concentrated m South Africa, although inte- 
grated iron and steel plants are now located in 
N Africa, Nigeria, and Rhodesia Large petro- 
chemical complexes are located m South Africa, 
Rhodesia, and Egypt, and a number of different 
countries have refineries Throughout most of

Africa, manufacturing is limited to making or 
assembling consumer goods, such as textiles, 
food and beverage preparation, shoes, building 
materials, and cement 

The commercial sectors of most African states 
rely heavily on one or a few export commodi- 
ties The bulk of trade occurs with industrialized 
nations, which require raw materials and sell 
industrial and consumer goods Trade between 
African states is limited by the competitive, 
rather than complementary, nature of their 
products, by communication systems, and by 
trade barriers, such as tariffs, and different 
currencies The major trade zones to have de- 
veloped are the East African Community, the 
Economic Community of West Africa, and the 
Central African Economic and Customs Union 
HISTORY 

Some 5,000,000 years ago a type of man ape, 
regarded as a close evolutionary ancestor of 
man, inhabited southern and eastern Africa 
About 1,000,000 years ago this toolmaking homi- 
nid developed into the more advanced forms 
Homo habilis and Homo erectus The earliest 
true man in Africa, Homo sapiens, dates from 


about 130,000 years ago A hunter and gatherer, 
he banded together with others to form no- 
madic groups and was capable of making crude 
stone tools By approximately 35,000 years ago, 
man appears to have spread throughout Africa 
Distinct African races can be traced to about 
10,000 years ago, by which time Bushmanoid 
sites could be found from the Sahara down to 
southern Africa Negroid peoples appear to 
have developed m western Africa during the 
same time 

Settled communities appear to have been first 
developed in Africa in the Nile valley about 
5000 BC Dependent upon agriculture, these 
communities benefited from the Nile's flooding 
as a source of irrigation and of new soils 
Elaborate political and religious systems 
emerged, and by 3000 b c the kingdoms that had 
been founded in both Upper and Lower Egypt 
were united into one state under the pharaohs 
During Its period of prominence, Egyptian influ- 
ence penetrated south into the Sudan, and 
when, after 1000 bc, the power of Egypt de- 
clined, Kush in the Sudan became the most 
important of the new African centers of power 
Iron-making was brought south from Egypt 
about 800 BC, and in following centuries it

appears to have spread south and west through 
tropical Africa The last major Kushite state, 
Meroe, was supplanted during the 3rd century 
ad, and Aksum (Axum) became the major 
successor state During the same period Aksum, 
which evolved into Ethiopia, was converted 
to Monophysite Christianity Other Christian 
states — Alodio, Nukuna, and Nobatia — took 
hold in the Sudan and developed independ- 
ently of Aksum 

By the middle of the 1st century ad the 
various independent north African states, in- 
cluding Carthage (qv), had been conquered 
and absorbed into the Roman Empire Northern 
Africa became the granary of the empire, and 
under such Fathers of the Church as Saint 
Augustine, a stronghold and influential center 
of Christianity At the end of the 4th century the 
empire was divided into two parts All lands 
west of a line roughly bisecting modern Libya 
remained territories of the Western Empire, 
ruled by Rome, and all lands to the east became 
part of the Eastern or Byzantine Empire, ruled

the 5th century and conquered the western 
Roman provinces In the 6th century the Vandal 
kings were defeated by Byzantine forces, the 
provinces absorbed by the Eastern Empire 
The Era of Empires and City-States. Islam 
gained a foothold in Africa within ten years of 
the death of Muhammad in 632 ad The weak- 
ened Byzantine province of Egypt was easily 
conquered, and during the period 660 to 670, 
Muslim raiders struck at the rest of Mediterra- 
nean northern Africa Although some raids 
reached the Fezzan area of southern Libya and 
parts of Morocco, Berber resistance proved too 
strong In the 8th century, however, Morocco 
was conquered and the Christian Berbers of the 
coast began to be converted The pagan Berbers 
of the mountainous interior resisted and either 
maintained isolated strongholds or withdrew 
into the Sahara Along the coast the Arab 
conquerors remained a small ruling minority for 
several centuries Only m the mid-llth century, 
with the arrival of new Arab immigrants, the 
nomadic Banu Hilal, were the pastoral Berbers 
fully assimilated into Muslim religious and cul- 
tural life The remaining resisters were driven 
into the deserts of Mauritania 




AFRICA 



A number of rival dynasties emerged on the 
north African coast, and from the 10th century 
onward, north African Muslims engaged m raids 
and expeditions of conquest against Christian 
Europe During the Crusades, Egypt, Tunis, and 
other north African areas were invaded, but by 
the late 13th century, invasion attempts had 
given way to raiding and pirating by both sides 
In 1517 Ottoman Turks invaded Egypt and 
within fifty years had established nominal con- 
trol of the north African coast, see Ottoman 
Empire 

The initial 7th-century Muslim invasion of 
Egypt had quickly led to attacks upon the 
Christian states of the Sudan and Ethiopia The 
armies of Nobatia proved strong enough, how- 
ever, to force the conclusion of a treaty that 
brought comparative peace for 600 years Dur- 
ing the 14th century Christian Sudan fell to the 
armies of Mameluke Egypt (see Mamelukes), and 
with the coming of Arab immigrants, the region 
became thoroughly Arabicized The Ethiopians 
were able to keep Muslim invaders at bay 
somewhat longer, but m the middle of the 16th 
century, the armies of the sultanate of Adal, 
with Turkish support, overran some three quar- 
ters of the country

West African Kingdoms A number of kingdoms 
emerged in the western Sudan whose economic 
base lay in their control of trans-Saharan trade 
routes Gold, kola nuts, and slaves were sent 
north in exchange for cloth, utensils, and salt 
Ghana, the earliest known of these states, came 
into being by the 5th century a d in what is now 
southeastern Mauritania (Its capital, Kumbi 
Salih, has been excavated in modern times ) By 
the 11th century Ghanaian armies, equipped 
with iron weapons, had made it master of the 
trade routes extending from modern-day Mo- 
rocco in the north to the coastal forests of 
western Africa in the south Nomadic Berber 
tribes, particularly the Sanhaja confederation, 
formed the chief link between Ghana and the 
north Once Muslim Arabs gained control of the 
northwestern coasts, they began to exploit these 
Berber routes By the early 11th century Muslim 
ministers and advisers were at the court of 
Ghana, and Muslim merchants lived in large 
foreign quarters from which they conducted 
lucrative large-scale trade Late in the 11th 
century, Ghana was destroyed by the Almora- 
vids {see Almoravids), a militant Muslim move- 
ment founded among the Berber tribes of the

Sanhaja In the early 11th century they raised a 
Jihad (holy war) and soon came to control the 
caravan routes of the Sahara The movement 
then split, with one part pushing north to 
conquer Morocco and Spam, while the other 
moved south to raze (about 1076-77) the capital 
of Ghana During the following century the 
Susu, formerly vassals of Ghana, gained control 
of the area, but in turn they were conquered by 
the people of Mali about 1240 

Mall, centered on the upper reaches of the 
Senegal and Niger rivers, evolved from a group 
of Mande chieftaincies, probably by the early 
11th century In the middle of the 13th century, 
the state began a period of expansion under the 
vigorous ruler Sundiata Soon afterward the 
rulers of Mali appear to have converted to Islam 
The high point of the Mali empire was reached 
under Mansa Musa, who conducted a pilgrim- 
age to Mecca in 1324—25, opened diplomatic 
relations with Tunis and Egypt, and brought a 
number of Muslim scholars and artisans to the 
empire, from the time of Mansa Musa onward. 
Mall appeared on the maps of Europe After 
1400 the empire declined through dynastic dis- 
putes, and Songhai (q v ) emerged as the lead- 
ing state in the western Sudan Although Song- 
hai dates from before the 9th century, it enjoyed 
Its greatest period of expansion under Sonni Ah 
(r 1464-92) and Askia Muhammad (r 1493- 
1528) During this time Islam flourished at the 
court, and Timbuktu became a major center of 
Muslim learning, renowned for its university 
and Its book trade Attracted by its wealth, the 
armies of ai-Mansur (r 1579-1603) of Morocco 
overran the Songhai capital of Gao in 1591 (see 
Morocco History) Following the collapse of 
Songhai, a number of small kingdoms, Macina, 
Gonja, Segou, and Ka'arta, strove to dominate 
the western Sudan, but continual strife and 
economic decline were the only results 

To the east of Songhai, between the Niger R 
and Lake Chad, the Hausa city-states and the 
Kanem-Bornu empire emerged The Hausa 
states (Biram, Daura, Katsma, Zaria, Kano, Rano, 
and Gobir) originated before the 10th century, 
and after the fall of Songhai the trans-Saharan 
trade moved eastward, where it came under the 
control of Katsma and Kano These became 
centers of flourishing commerce and urban life 
Islam appears to have been introduced into the 
Hausa states in the 14th century from Kanem- 
Bornu 

The latter empire is known to have existed in 
the 8th century as a loosely knit state north and 
east of Lake Chad It was first ruled by a 
nomadic people, the Zaghawa, but they were 


replaced by a new dynasty, the Saifawa, who 
ruled from about 800 to 1846 The new rulers 
were converted to Islam about the 11th century 
In the late 14th century they moved into the 
Bornu region, and the older Kanem area fell to 
the Bulala people The most well known of the 
Bornu rulers was Mai Idris Alooma (r 1570- 
1602), who introduced firearms purchased from 
the Ottoman Turks During the height of its 
power, Bornu-Kanem controlled the eastern 
Saharan routes to Egypt, but by the middle of 
the 17th century it had gone into a slow decline. 

During the period of the great Sudanic em- 
pires, the lives of the masses of farmers and 
fishermen remained virtually unchanged Im- 
ported goods or luxuries were consumed only 
by the ruling classes, while the farmers lived m 
subsistence economies, subject to periodic tax 
gathering and occasional slave raids Islam was 
associated with the great urban centers and was 
the religion of some of the ruling classes and of 
the foreign residents By the late 15th century, 
however, the nomadic Kunta Arabs began to 
preach, and during the mid-16th century the 
Qadiriyya brotherhood began to spread Islam 
throughout the western Sudan At about the 
same time, the Fuia (q v ), a nomadic pastoral 
people, were wandering slowly eastward from 
the Futa Toro region in Senegal, gaming con- 
verts for Islam During this period, Islam became 
a personal religion rather than merely a religion 
of state Indeed, Islam appears to have declined 
among the ruling classes, and non-Muslim 
dynasties began to rule in old Islamic strong- 
holds This continued until the 18th century, 
when Islamic reform and revival movements 
sprang up among the Fula, Mandmgo, Susu, and 
Tukolor 

Old dynasties were overthrown, and theo- 
cratic states were founded which spread Islam 
to new areas In the Hausa states, Shehu Usman 
dan Fodio, a Muslim teacher, led a revolt among 
the Fula, who between 1804 and 1810 overthrew 
the pagan Hausa rulers and established new 
dynasties An attempt to sweep into Bornu was 
successfully resisted by the ruler Mai Al-Kanemi 
The new Fula empire was initially divided be- 
tween the shehu's brother and his son, but after 
1817 the son and his successors were the sole 
overlords They were unable, however, to main- 
tain more than a shadow hegemony over the 
semiautonomous emirates 

Another theocratic state was formed m 
Masina in 1818 by Seku Ahmadu, a Fula Muslim 
During his rule an empire embracing the whole 
of the Niger R region from Jenne to Timbuktu 
was created Upon his death in 1844 hts son

East African Kingdoms The first records of east 
African history appear in the Penplus ot the 
Erythrsean Sea (100? ad), which described the 
commercial life of the region, its ties to the 
Greco-Roman world, and its trade with Arabia, 
Persia, and India Indonesian immigrants 
reached Madagascar sometime during the 1st 
millennium ad, bringing new foodstuffs, nota- 
bly bananas, which then spread throughout the 
continent As Bantu-speaking and Nilotic peo- 
ples occupied the interior, absorbing the earlier 
Bushman peoples, Arab settlers colonized the 
coast and established trading towns Ivory, gold, 
and slaves were the mam exports By the 13th 
century a number of significant city-states had 
been established, among them Mogadishu, 
Lamu, Mombasa, Kilwa, and Pate An urban 
Arab-Swahili culture developed through mutual 
assimilation of Bantu and Arabic speakers The 
ruling classes appear to have been of a mixed 
Arab-African ancestry, the masses were Afri- 
cans, many of them slaves The way of life in the 
towns was clearly mercantile These city-states 
were oriented toward the sea, and their impact 
upon inland peoples was virtually nonexistent 
until the 19th century 

Inland from the coast, the Interlacustrine 
states began to be formed by about the middle 
of the 14th century Little is known of their early 
history, but one widely held theory is that 
western Kushite peoples may have migrated 
from the Ethiopian highlands to found these 
kingdoms The Kushites are associated with the 
ancestors of the Hima and Tusi peoples and 
with the Bachwezi A variety of Bachwezi king- 
doms are thought to have been established 
between lakes Victoria and Edward between 
1350 and 1500 These were supplanted by an 
early wave of Lwo peoples, who moved south 
from the Sudan about 1500 The new immigrants 
adopted local Bantu languages in Bunyoro 
country, but in Acholiland, Alurland, and in the 
Lango country they retained their own separate 
language With the coming of the Lwo, new 
states were founded, among them Bunyoro, 
Ankole, Buganda, and Karagwe Of these states, 
Bunyoro was the most powerful until the mid- 
dle of the 17th century Then Buganda began to 
expand, and its armies raided throughout wide 
areas An elaborate centralized bureaucracy was 
founded, with most district and subdistrict 
chiefs appointed by the kabaka (king) 

Further to the south, in Rwanda, a cattle-rais- 
ing, pastoral aristocracy founded by the Ba- 


chwezi (alternatively called Batutsi or Bahima m 
this area) ruled over settled Bantu peoples from 
about the 16th century onward 
Central African Kingdoms Even less is known of 
the states formed m central Africa In the Congo 
savanna, south of the tropical ram forests, 
Bantu-speaking peoples are thought to have 
established agricultural communities by the be- 
ginning of the 9th century In some places, 
long-distance trade to the east coast developed, 
with copper and ivory among the mam exports 
Probably during the 14th century the Kongo 
kingdom was established, dominating an area 
from the Congo R to Stanley Pool, and from the 
Loje R to the Atlantic An elaborate political 
system developed, with provincial governors 
and a king elected from among the descendants 
of the founding king, Wene In the area be- 
tween the upper Kasai and Lake Tanganyika, the 
various small chiefdoms were organized, about 
1500, into the Luba Empire Its founding figure, 
Kongolo, subdued several small villages in one 
area and then used this as a base for wider 
conquest No adequate centralizing mecha- 
nisms were developed, however, so dynastic 
struggles and breakaway states were a continual 
problem Around 1600 one of the younger sons 
of the dynasty left the kingdom and founded 
the Lunda Empire The Lunda state itself soon 
split, with members of the royal dynasty leaving 
to found such new states as the Bemba king- 
dom, Kasanje, and Kazembe The latter became 
the largest and most powerful of the Luba- 
Lunda states, and between 1750 and 1850 it 
dominated southern Katanga and parts of the 
Rhodesian plateau 

Bantu-speaking peoples moving east from the 
Congo region during the 1st millennium ad are 
thought to have assimilated local Stone Age 
Rhodesian peoples to form the Shona culture 
These people, m turn, may have been responsi- 
ble for Zimbabwe, a cluster of stone structures, 
the original purpose of which remains unclear, 
and the Mutapa Empire Based upon long-dis- 
tance trade in gold, Mutapa is thought to have 
stretched, at its height in the 15th century, from 
the Zambezi R to the Kalahari to the Indian 
Ocean and to the Limpopo R 
Southern African Kingdoms Before the 19th 
century, Bantu-speakmg peoples had pushed 
aside or assimilated their Bushman and Hotten- 
tot predecessors in southern Africa and had 
established a number of sedentary states Popu- 
lation pressures and tribal rivalries resulted in a 
series of wars (the mfecane) that led to large- 
scale migrations through south and central Af- 
rica About 1816 the Zulu chief Chaka (1773- 


237 



AFRICA 


1828) developed new military techniques and 
embarked upon wars of conquest against neigh- 
boring peoples The tribes defeated by the Zulu 
armies migrated away from the southeast por- 
tion of South Africa, remodeling their own 
fighting techniques on those of the Zulu, they 
overwhelmed more distant peoples, who, in 
turn, were forced to seek new homes The 
Ndwandwe, led by their chief Sobhuza, moved 
north and established the Swazi kingdom about 
1840 The Ngoni also moved north, pushing 
through Mozambique and beyond Lake Malawi, 
where, about 1848, they split into five kingdoms, 
which raided extensively between Lake Victoria 
and the Zambezi Another group, led by 
Soshangana, migrated into south Mozambique, 
where they founded the Gaza state about 1830 
The Koloio migrated north into Barotseiand and 
began a struggle for domination with the local 
Lozi people The Ndebele moved (1824-34) west 
and then north (1837) into Rhodesia, founding a 
kingdom there m Matabeleland 
The Era of European Colonialism. The first 
sustained European interest in Africa developed 
through the efforts of Henry (q v ), Prmce of 
Portugal, usually known as Henry the Navigator 
Numerous expeditions were sent out after 1434, 
each seemingly extending European knowledge 
of the African coastline southward, until, in 
1498, Vasco da Gama (q v ) rounded the Cape of 
Good Hope and reached India 

The Portuguese explorations were motivated 
by a variety of impulses a desire for knowledge, 
a wish to bring Christianity to pagan peoples, 
the search for potential allies against Muslim 
threats, and the hope of finding new and 
lucrative trade routes and sources of wealth 
Wherever the Portuguese and the English, 
French, and Dutch who followed them touched, 
they disrupted ongoing patterns of trade and 
political life and changed economic and reli- 
gious systems 

The Portuguese established a chain of trading 
settlements along the west African coast El 
Mina, founded on the Gold Coast m 1482, was 
the most important African gold, ivory, food- 
stuffs, and slaves were exchanged for ironware, 
firearms, textiles, and foodstuffs The lucrative 
Portuguese trade attracted rival European trad- 
ers who, in the 16th century, created competing 
stations or attempted to capture existing trade 
forts In western Africa the new trade had 
profound effects Earlier trade routes had been 
oriented northward across the Sahara, primarily 
to the Muslim world Now the routes were 
reoriented to the coast, and as the states of the 
savanna declined in economic importance, 

238 


states along the coast increased their wealth 
and power Struggles soon developed among 
coastal peoples for control over trade routes 
and for access to the new firearms introduced 
from Europe 

With the rise of the slave trade to the Ameri- 
cas, wars over the control of African commerce 
became more intense During the four centuries 
of the slave trade, between 30,000,000 and 
100,000,000 Africans were estimated to have 
fallen victim to this traffic in human lives Most 
of these were captured by other Africans and 
exchanged for a variety of consumer goods The 
first major slaving kingdom, established in the 
15th century, was Benin, in modern west Nige- 
ria By the end of the 17th century, it had been 
supplanted by the kingdoms of Dahomey and 
Oyo In the mid-18th century the Ashanti began 
their rise as a major west African power Under 
asantehene (king) Osei Kojo, Ashanti armies 
began to push south toward European trading 
stations located along the Cold Coast Although 
they failed in their efforts to clear the routes of 
middlemen, they secured steady supplies of 
firearms, which were used to expand northward 
and to contest their eastern frontiers with 
Dahomey Further east the Yoruba kingdom of 
Oyo declined m the late 18th century, bringing 
civil war and the intervention of Fula forces 
from the north About 1835 the imperial capital. 
Old Oyo, was abandoned, but in the Battle of 
Oshogbo (about 1840) the Fula were driven 
back Continued civil war brought intervention 
from Dahomey and hastened the collapse of 
Yoruba power 

During the second half of the 18th century, 
sentiment in Europe turned against the slave 
trade Following the Mansfield decision of 1772, 
which freed slaves held in Great Britain, plans 
were made for a west African colony for freed- 
men This was originally attempted (1787-90) in 
the '"Provence of Freedom" at Saint George's 
Bay, after it failed, a second attempt was made 
by abolitionists, who, in 1792, founded Free- 
town When the British outlawed the slave trade 
for British citizens in 1807, Freetown appeared a 
desirable naval base, and m 1808, Sierra Leone 
was made a crown colony The example of 
Sierra Leone appealed to Americans interested 
in black colonization, and m early 1822 the 
American Colonization Society succeeded in 
establishing its colony, Liberia, at nearby Cape 
Mesurado 

The British desire to suppress the slave trade 
found expression in attempts at redirecting 
African commerce toward other exports, such as 
palm oil, heightened missionary activity, and

the imposition of British government jurisdic- 
tion over properties previously held by British 
merchants Such developments frequently in- 
volved Great Britain inadvertently in struggles 
with African states and led to its assumption of 
sovereignty over certain African territory On 
the Gold Coast the British government, in 1821, 
took control of a series of forts Through misun- 
derstandings the first of a series of Ashanti-Brit- 
ish wars occurred from 1823 to 1826, these 
conflicts were to continue intermittently until 
the end of the century Although the govern- 
ment gave up control of the forts m 1828, it 
again assumed jurisdiction in 1843 British at- 
tempts to protect coastal Africans from the 
Ashanti led to more fighting In the Niger delta 
area of Nigeria, the British abolition of slavery 
brought about concrete efforts to restrain the 
illegal trade, but in pursuit of this end Great 
Britain required a nearby port In 1852 the ruler 
of Lagos accepted British protection, and in 
1861 Lagos was annexed as a crown colony 

In central and east Africa the European impact 
differed When the Portuguese arrived on the 
Congo-Angola coast in the 1480's, they quickly 
allied themselves with the rulers of the Kongo, 
who became converted to Christianity and at- 
tempted to create a westernized state This aim 
was frustrated, however, by fraternal wars and 
by Portuguese introduction of the slave trade 
The region was soon immersed in strife, and 
during the 16th century the kingdom collapsed 
Further south the Portuguese founded Luanda 
in 1575 as a base for their penetration of the 
Angolan hinterland When they reached the 
east African coast, they attempted to cut off the 
area's trade with the Muslim world In the 
process a number of the city-states were de- 
stroyed, others were occupied, and the entire 
area went into economic decline After the 
Portuguese were finally expelled from Mombasa 
m 1698, the coast reverted to local rule, but 
during the 18th century the rulers of Oman 
(q V ) established at least nominal control In the 
early 19th century, Sayyid Said (r 1806-56), ruler 
of Oman, transferred his capital to Zanzibar, 
which then served as a base to strengthen his 
control of the coast and to penetrate inland for 
trade with the Interlacustnne states British 
efforts to control the east African slave trade 
led, m 1822, to a treaty prohibiting the sale of 
slaves to subjects of Christian countries An 
active slave trade continued, however, with 
large numbers of Africans seized for the clove 
plantations of Zanzibar and for Middle Eastern 
slave markets 

In Ethiopia the arrival of the Portuguese had 


helped stave off conquest by the Muslims In 
1543 a combined Portuguese-Ethiopian force 
crushed a Muslim army, and the Ethiopians 
regained much of their lost territory After 
doctrinal disputes between Coptic churchmen 
and Portuguese Jesuits, the Portuguese were 
expelled in 1632 Ethiopia went into a period of 
isolation, and by the 18th century the monarchy 
was in collapse From about 1769 to 1855, 
Ethiopia endured the "age of princes", during 
which the emperors were puppet rulers con- 
trolled by powerful provincial nobles The era 
came to an end with the crowning of Emperor 
Theodore II, a minor chief who rose to the 
throne by defeating his rivals 
Although the Portuguese largely ignored 
southern Africa, their rivals the Dutch, begin- 
ning in 1682, developed the area as a way 
station to the East Indies Colonists were en- 
couraged to settle around Cape Town, and soon 
a new culture and people, the Boers or Afrikan- 
ers, began to develop Despite government 
resistance they began to move inland m search 
of better land and, after 1815, to escape control 
by the British government As they trekked 
inland they encountered the Zulu and other 
Bantu peoples expanding southward The result 
was a series of wars for land During the course 
of their migrations, the Boers were among the 
first whites to explore the African interior 
In the late 18th century, however, scientific 
interest and the search for new markets began 
to stimulate an age of exploration The British 
explorer James Bruce (q v ) reached the source 
of the Blue Nile R in 1770, his countryman 
Mungo Park {q v ) journeyed (1795-1805) to 
discover the course of the Niger R , the German 
explorer Heinrich Barth made extensive explora- 
tions of the Muslim western Sudan, the Scottish 
missionary David Livingstone (q v ) made a 
number of significant explorations and in 1855 
named Victoria Falls, the British explorers John 
Hanning Speke (q v.) and James Augustus Grant 
(1821-93), traveling downstream, and Sir Samuel 
White Baker (q v ), working upstream, solved 
the mystery of the source of the Nile R in 1863 
Following the footsteps of the explorers (and 
sometimes preceding them) were Christian mis- 
sionaries and then European merchants 
As European private interests m Africa grew, 
the involvement of their governments multi- 
plied The French began the conquest of Algeria 
in the 1830's, but the systematic occupation of 
tropical Africa did not occur until the second 
half of the century As European citizens and 
administrators penetrated inland, they encoun- 
tered resistance from dominant peoples and

welcome from subordinated peoples seeking 
allies or protectors From about 1875 to the 
beginning of World War I, most of Africa was 
partitioned among Belgium, France, Germany, 
Great Britain, Italy, and Portugal In 1876 King 
Leopold II of Belgium (see under Leopold) 
convened a conference to determine the best 
methods of exploring Africa The claims of his 
International African Association for privileged 
position were brushed aside, however, and it 
was confined to exploring and colonizing por- 
tions of the Congo region By 1884 the intense 
rivalry of the European powers for additional 
African territory, and the ill-defined boundaries 
of their various holdings, threatened their inter- 
national relations With Leopold taking the 
initiative, a conference was called at Berlin All 
the nations of Europe, together with the United 
States, sent delegates to the conference (1884- 
85), at which the modern partition of Africa 
took shape 

At the Berlin conference the powers defined 
their spheres of influence and laid down rules 
for future occupation on the coasts of Africa 
and for navigation of the Congo and Niger 
rivers Among the important provisions of the 
General Act of Berlin was the rule that when a 
power acquired new territory m Africa or as- 


sumed a protectorate over any part of the 
continent, it must notify the other powers 
signatory to the conference During the next 
fifteen years, numerous treaties were negotiated 
among the European nations, implementing and 
modifying the provisions of the conference 
Two such treaties were concluded m 1890 by 
Great Britain The first, with Germany, demar- 
cated the spheres of influence of the two 
powers in Africa The second treaty, with 
France, recognized British interests in the region 
between Lake Chad and the Niger R and 
acknowledged French influence in the Sahara 
Other agreements, notably those between Great 
Britain and Italy in 1891, between France and 
Germany in 1894, and between Great Britain 
and France in 1899, further clarified the bounda- 
ries of the various European holdings in Africa 
No African states had been invited to the 
conferences, and none were signatory to these 
agreements Whenever possible the decisions 
made in Europe were resisted when applied on 
African soil The French faced (1870) a revolt in 
Algeria and resistance (1881-1905) to their ef- 
forts to control the Sahara In the western 
Sudan, Samory Toure and the son of Al-Hajj 
Umar attempted (1873-98), unsuccessfully, to 
maintain their independence Dahomey was 
occupied by French forces m 1892, and the 
Darfar-Wadai region was the last area to fall to

Onc(* the colonies were* conquereci and paci- 
fied, the colonial administrations began to de- 
velop transfK)rtation systems so that raw materi- 
als could l)e shippt*d more easily to ports f(3r

force subsistence farmers c*ither to raise cash 
crops or to engage in migrant labor. Both poli- 
cies were* well uncier way whem World War I

war, the* Ge*rman colonu's wc*r(* tonquereni and 
later wc*re rrtandate*d by the League* of Nations

was Hmiteci to the short »iive*cl 191 S re^bcHlion of

After World War I, efforts for the* e*xploitatton 
of the colonies we*re tempered, and greate»r at- 
tention was paid to providing e*duc ation, health 
services, and ciewelopmemt assistance, and to 
safe*guarding African lancJ rights Nevertheless, 
the white settle»r colonies, such as Algeria, 
Southern Rhociesia, and K<»nya, were given con* 
siderable internal self-government Southern 
Rho<ie*sia was made an internally sc*lf-gove*rning 
crown colony in 192 i with virtually no provision 
lor African voting. During the interwar years, 
various types of African-organized prote*st and 
nationalist movememts t>egan to emerge*. Yet, on 
the whole, membership was limited to western- 
educated African groups. Mass parties cieveb 
oped only in Egypt and Algeria, where large 
numbers of Africans had abandoned their tradi- 
tional way of life and were developing new 
Identities and allegiances. Ethiopia, which had 
earlier successfully resismei European coloniza* 
tion, fell to an Italian invasion in 1936 and did 
not regain its independence until World War II. 


With the coming ot the war, Africans served in 
the AlliecJ armies in even greater numbers than 
before, and the colonies generally supported 
the Allied cause Fighting on the continent, 
which was limited to north and northeast Africa, 
ended in May, 1943

pean colonial powers were physically and psy- 
chologically weakened, and the balance of in- 
ternational power shifted to the U S and the 
Soviet Union, both professed anticolomal na- 
tions In north Africa, French rule was opposed 
from 1947* onward with sporadic terrorism and 
noting The Algerian revolution began m 1954 
and continued until independence m 1962, six 
years after Morocco and Tunisia had received 
independence In French sub-Saharan Africa, an 
effort had been made to stave off nationalist 
movements by granting the inhabitants of the 
overseas territories full status as citizens and by 
allowing deputies and senators from each terri- 
tory to sit in the French National Assembly 
Nonetheless, the qualified franchise and com- 
munal representation given to each territory 
proved unacceptable In the British areas the 
pace of change also quickened after the war 
Mass parties, enrolling as wide a range of social, 
ethnic, and economic groups as possible, began 
to appear In Sudan, disagreements between 
Egypt and Great Britain over the direction of Su- 
danese self-government led the British to accel- 
erate the pace, and in 1954 Sudan achieved in- 
dependence louring the 1950's, the examples ot 
newly independent nations on other continents, 
the activitic*s of the Mau Mau terrorist move- 
ment of Konya, and the effectiveness of such 
popular African leaders as Kwame Nkrumah fur- 
ther quickened the pace The independence of 
Ghana in 1957 and Guinea in 1958 set off a 
chain reaction of nationalist demands In 1960 
alone seventeen sovereign African nations came 
into being. 

By mid-1978 almost all of Africa was indepen- 
dent. The Portuguese possessions— Angola, 
Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, and Mozambique— 
became independent m 1974-75, France relin- 
quished the Comoro islands in 1975, and the 
French Territory of the Afars and the Issas 
gained independence as Djibouti in 1977. In 
1976 Spam yielded Spanish Sahara, which then 
was divided between Mauritania and Morocco. 
The only remaining large dependencies were 
South-West Africa and Rhodesia (whose white 
minority had declared unilateral independence 
in 1%5), scheduled for early independence 

The new African states face a variety of major 
problems. One of the most important is the 

245 



AFRICA 


creation of a nation-state Most African coun- 
tries retained the same frontiers arbitrarily 
drawn by the late 19th-century European diplo- 
mats and administrators Ethnic groups may be 
divided by national boundaries, but often 
loyalties are stronger toward such groups than 
toward the state. Part of the solution to this 
problem could stem from efficient governmen- 
tal administrations that, by their actions, would 
receive the support and loyalty of the entire 
population. When the African states attained 
independence, however, the dominant nation- 
alist movements and their leaders installeci 
themselves m virtually permanent power. They 
called for national unity and urged that multi- 
party parliamentary systems be discarded in 
favor of the single-party state When these 
governments proved unable or unwilling to 
fulfill popular expectations, there was often no 
alternative except military intervention. Project- 
ing the role of efficient and honest public 
guardian, military governments have emerged as 
a major African political form. Under such a 
system, day-to-day administration is left to the 
permanent civil service. In the 197D\, however, 
the military governments of some countries 
appeared to be developing the same vested 
interest in power that had characterized their 
predecessor civilian governments. Economic de- 
velopment was the third major problem. Al- 
though a number of African states have consid- 
erable natural resources, few have adequate 
financial resources to develop their economies. 
Foreign private enterprise has often regarded 
investment in such underdeveloped areas as too 
risky, and this view has been justified in a 
number of instances The major alternative 
source of financing is the national or multina- 
tional source. Yet foreign aid has tended to 
decrease as the U S -Soviet Union detente takes 
hold, and the former cofonial powers have 
tended to need such funds for their own eco- 
nomic modernization. Expectations for a better 
living standard have increased, and the price of 
consumer and other manufactured goods has 
kept pace, but the price of most African primary 
products has lagged behind. This has resulted m 
serious foreign-exchange problems, national 
debts, and public discontent. A fourth major 
problem has been the inability to project a 
voice in international affairs. Most African states 
regard themselves as part of the Third or Non- 
aligned World, which is seen as a force for 
moral leadership in the internallonaf commu- 
nity. Because of their lack of military or financial 
power, however, the views of African nations 
rarely appear to be couriEted.

Rock paintings found in north, south, and east

ent-day Algeria date from 4000 BC Of particular 
interest are paintings done by Bushmen in 
southern African caves Terra-cotta objects 
found in Nok in northern Nigeria are now dated 
from as far back as 300 bc The terra-cotta and 
brass heads from Ife in southwestern Nigeria are 
believed to have originated as early as 1000 ad 
A rtists at Benin, artistic heir of Ife, employed the 
cire-perdu (lost-wax) method of brass casting to 
produce a large body of hollow brass and 
bronze sculpture that has been classified into 
three periods early Benin (14th to mid-16th 
century), middle Benin (mtd-16th to late 17th 
century), and late Benin (1700-1897). African art 
history is only now being established For most 
of the continent it yet remains undetermined 
This circumstance is to some degree the result 
of the fact that wood was the chief material 
used by the tribal artist, with the exceptions 
noted above Wood, a highly perishable mate- 
rial, cannot long withstand the effects of tropi- 
cal weather and insects. Among other factors 
accounting for a certain paucity of extant Afri- 
can sculpture, including even those objects 
fashioned of more durable materials, were tribal 
customs that seldom encouraged the preserva- 
tion of such ritual paraphernalia as masks and 
figures. 

Among the tribes of Africa, those that inhabit 
western Africa and the Congo display excep- 
tional creative skill as artists, and their artistic 
traditions are deeply rooted. The principal tribes 
engaged in wood carving, brass casting, or both, 
are the Saga of Guinea; Dan of Liberia, Dogon 
and Bambara of the Republic of Mali; Mossi and 
Bobo of Upper Volta, Senufo, Baulo and Guro of 
the Republic of the Ivory Coast; Akan tribes of 
Ghana; Fon of the Republic of Dahomey; Yo~ 
ruba and Edo of western Nigeria; Mambila and 
Tiv of northern Nigeria; Bamileke of Cameroon; 
Fang, Kota and Mpongwe of Gabon Republic; 
Lumbo and Teke of the Republic of Congo 
(Brazzaville); and Ngbaka, Zande, Mangbetu, 
Kuba, tuba, Chokwe, Songe, and Kongo of the 
Republic of Zaire. Among the nomadic tribes of 
east and south Africa, traditional oral literature 
is a more common form of artistic expression 
than sculpture. 

Early m the 20th century, African art began to 
exert a profound influence on Western art. In 
particular, the Fauvist (q.v.) artists were greatly 
attracted to African sculpture. Beginning about 
1908, it influenced the work of the cubists. 


among them the Spanish painter Pablo Picasso, 
the French painter Georges Braque, the Ruma- 
nian sculptor Constantin Brancu§i, and the Ital- 
ian painter and sculptor Amedeo Modigliani 
(qq V.) The resultant quest by galleries, private 
collectors, and tourists for African sculpture in- 
evitably corrupted tribal standards of artistry in 
many areas.

AFRICAN LANGUAGES, languages indige- 
nous to the African continent More than a 
thousand different languages are spoken in Af- 
rica. Apart from Arabic (see Arabic Language and 
Literature), which is not confined to Africa, the 
most widely spoken African tongues are Swahili 
and Hausa (qqv), each with over 10,000,CXX) 
speakers. Several languages (often inaccurately 
termed dialects simply because they have few 
users) are spoken by only a few thousand peo- 
ple On the average an African language has 
about 200,000 speakers, only a few dozen lan- 
guages have more than 1,000,000 speakers Al- 
though very few African languages have written 
literatures, the majority of them have long- 
standing traditions of oral literature 

According to the most recent and widely ac- 
cepted scholarly practice, the languages of Af- 
rica are grouped into four language families: 
Afro-Asiatic, Nilo-Saharan, Khoisan, and Niger- 
Kordofanian A language family is a group of re- 
lated languages presumably derived from a 
common origin, a family is often subdivided 
into branches composed of more closely related 
languages. At least some of the African linguistic 
families are believed to have a history dating 
back well over SOOO years. African languages 
that belong to different families are as little alike 
as English, Turkish, Chinese, and Navaho, al- 
though the disparate tongues may be spoken m 
the same locality. Even within a single family, 
African languages may be as different m sound 
and structure as are English, Italian, Russian, and 
Hindustani, which are all members of the Indo- 
European language family Within a given 
branch of one family, however, languages are 
often as closely related as are German, Dutch, 
and Swedish 

Writing systems exist for only about half the 
languages of Africa, and in certain tongues the 
only written literature is a translation of some 
portion of the New Testament. Except for Arabic

and certain languages of Ethiopia, the alphabets 
of most African languages are based on adapta- 
tions of the Roman alphabet and were intro- 
duced by missionaries. A few tribes, notably the 
Vai in Liberia and the Bamum in Cameroon, 
have developed their own syllabic writing sys- 
tems. 

The first European students of African lan- 
guages were usually missionaries, who, more 
than the members of any other group, have 
been concerned with learning to speak with the 
native papulation and with preparing literature 
for them. Much of the available information on 
African languages still comes from missionary 
sources. A major early work on African lan- 
guages is the Polyglotta Africana, by the mis- 
sionary-teacher Sigusmund W. Koelte (1823- 
1902); it contains a list of some 300 words and 
phrases in 156 different African languages; 
Koelle's information came from freed slaves liv- 
ing in the British West African protectorate of 
Sierra Leone. Twentieth-century scholars, such 
as the German linguists Carl Meinhof (1857- 
1944) and Diedrich Westermann (1875-1956), 
the South African linguist Clement Martyn 
Doke (1893- ), and such British linguists as 

Ida Caroline Ward (1880-1949) and Malcolm 
Guthrie (1903- ), have made substantial cojntri- 
butions to the knowledge of these languages 
and the relations of these languages to one an- 
other. The American linguist and anthropologist 
Joseph H. Greenberg (1915- ) significantly re- 
vised earlier notions of the groupings of African 
languages, although some modifications and 
finements of his 1963 classification car^ be ex* 
pected from the increasing number of scholars 
in the field. 

It is often suggested that the indigenous larv 
guages of Africa will eventually give way to in- 
ternationally Important iutopean languages, or 
at least to a few of the major languages native to 
Africa. In spite of an Increasing number of Afro 
can contacts with Europe and the United States, 
however, little likelihood exists that many Afri' 
can languages will disappeaf within the next 
few centuries. As Africa develops, more and 
more speakers of minor languages will probably 
also learn at least one major African language 
and possibly a European language as well; but 
the use of the mother tongue in the family circle* 
and in village and tribal affairs will doubtless 
persist much longer than most peoplt* <*xpi»c:c

Languages of the Chan-Nile branch are spo- 
ken in the northern part of the Republic of 
Chad, in the Sudan, in much of Uganda and 
Kenya, and m the northeastern corner of the Re- 
public of Congo Along the Nile R near the 
southern border of the Arab Republic of Egypt 
and m scattered areas to the southwest are the 
Nubian languages, Chari-Nile languages spoken 
by about 1,000,000 people Nubian religious 
documents dating from the 8th to the 14th 
centuries form the only literature of a living Af- 
rican language that was written before the mod- 
ern period In the southern Sudan and in north- 
ern Uganda and Kenya a group of languages 
known as Nilotic belongs to this branch, impor- 
tant representatives are Dinka, Nuer, Shilluk, 
and Acholi (or Luo). Languages spoken farther 
to the southeast, including Masai in Kenya, have 
long been called Nilo-Hamitic, recent investiga- 
tions, however, appear to prove that these 
tongues have no direct relationship to lan- 
guages of the Afro-Asiatic family, but are most 
closely related to the Nilotic languages. 

The very small Maban and Koman groups, and 
the single language Fur, also belong to the Nilo- 
Saharan family. 

In many Nilo-Saharan languages, a system of 
noun suffixes indicates grammatical relation- 
ships, this system somewhat resembles the case 
system of Latin (q.v.), but is quite unlike that of 
any other family of languages m Africa In the 
northern Nilotic languages, similar grammatical 
relationships are expressed by an extremely 
complex system of internal vowel changes; 
many of the vowel sounds themselves are unu- 
sually difficult for the learner. Various verbal 
constructions are indicated by senes of suffixes 
m some Nilo-Saharan languages (for example, 
Kanuri), or by both prefixes and suffixes In oth- 
ers (for example, the southern Nilotic lan- 
guage's) Many of these languages have a char- 
acteristic passive construction that is used much 
more freely than its counterpart in English, For 
example, "'He bought cloth"' is usually expressed 
as "Cloth was bought by him". This sentence 
can be shortened to "Cloth was bought" The 
action (buying) and the object (cloth) form the 
basic part of the sentence; the person who per- 
formed the action is comparatively unimpor- 
tant 

The Khoisan Family, The Khoisan languages 
comprise by all odds the smallest language fam- 
ily in Africa, with probably no more than 100,000 
speakers altogether. Most of these languages are 
spoken by the Bushman and Hottentot peoples 
of southern Africa; the largest of them is Nama, 


with about 25,000 speakers. Far to the northeast 
in Tanzania are two other representatives of this 
family, Sandawe, with about 23,000 speakers, 
and the much smaller Hadza The Khoisan lan- 
guages are best known for the unusual click 
consonants characteristic of most of them, in 
some Khoisan languages nearly every word be- 
gins with a click When these languages are 
written, the clicks are represented either by oth- 
erwise unused letters such as C, Q, X, 6r by spe- 
cial symbols such as /, >, // Some of the Kho- 
isan languages have a system of grammatical 
gender, which is found elsewhere in Africa only 
in the Afro-Asiatic family 
The Niger-Kordofanian Family. This family 
includes two subfamilies, Niger-Congo and Kor- 
dofanian Of these, the Kordofanian languages 
are only about thirty in number, and all of them 
are small, they are found in a small area of the 
Nuba hills m the southern Sudan, surrounded 
by languages of the Nilo-Saharan family and by 
Arabic. The Niger-Congo linguistic area, on the 
other hand, comprises almost all of the African 
continent below the Sahara Desert Although 
migrations presumably separated certain 
branches of the Niger-Congo subfamily more 
than 5000 years ago, languages m each of the 
branches have similar words for many common 
objects and actions; the still more distantly re- 
lated Kordofanian languages have a few such 
similar words, and show some striking resemb- 
lances to the Niger-Congo languages in gram- 
matical structure In contrast to the small num- 
ber of speakers in the Kordofanian subfamily, 
about three out of four African natives speak 
languages that belong to the Niger-Congo sub- 
family.

The Bantu languages do not constitute a sepa- 
rate family, but should logically be grouped 
with certain languages of Nigeria, such as Tiv

and Birom. All of these languages together are 
classified as the Benue-Congo branch of the 
Niger-Congo subfamily. It is by far the largest 
branch; the Bantu section alone numbers more 
speakers than all the rest of the Niger-Congo 
languages combined. 

North of the Bantu language area, in the 
northern Republic of Congo and adjacent terri- 
tory, is a second branch of the Niger-Congo 
subfamily, the Adamawa-Eastern branch. Its 
largest members are Zande and Ngbandi; a di- 
alect of Ngbandi known as Sango is widely used 
as an intertribal language in the Central African 
Republic, and is growing in importance. 

From Nigeria west, five additional branches of 
the Niger-Congo subfamily, which have fre- 
quently been called West Sudanic languages, 
are found. A group of three or four closely re- 
lated languages in the Niger Delta, together 
known as Ijo, constitutes one of the five 
branches. 

In a strip along the coast from southeastern 
Nigeria to Liberia are found the languages of the 
Kwa branch. This branch includes such impor- 
tant languages as Efik, Igbo, and Yoruba in Nige- 
ria; Ewe in Togo and Ghana; Fanti and Twi in 
Ghana; Anyi and Baule in the Ivory Coast; and 
Bassa and Kru in Liberia. Several of these Ian 
guages are used in schools, and a small but 
growing body of published literature exists. 

North of the Kwa language region, extending 
from western Nigeria into much of the Ivory 
Coast and Mali, are the languages of the Gur 
branch, including More in Upper Volta with 
about 2,000,000 speakers. 

Along the Atlantic coast, from to the 

desert north of Dakar, are s(weral languages of 
the West Atlantic branch, Ihesr^ indude femrte 
in Sierra Leone, Wolof in the vicinity of Dakar, 
and Fula (also known as Fuiani, f ulfulde, or 
Peulh), by far the most widely spoken, I wo 
large concentrations of Fulani^speaking people 
exist, one in Guinea and the other rather far 
the east in Nigeria and Cameroon, -Between 
these widely separatcKi areas, Fylani*speaking 
people are scattered in numerous camps in 
which they raise cattle and sell meat, milk, and 
butter to neighboring tribr^s, Fuiani Is not, as has 
sometimes been thought, a language. 

Speakers. of languages of the Man'de branch 
inhabit most of the remaining portion of West 
Africa. One -Mande language, known in various 
areas as .Maiinke, Maninka, Mandingo, iambara, 
and: Dyula, is spoken by some ,3,OCX),000 p«?ople 
from- Senegal through much ol Mali 'and north- 
ern Guinea, and into the northern ivory Coast.

AFRICAN LITERATURE 


constructions may indicate customary action 
(^'He laughs all the time"'), potential action (''He 
IS likely to get sick"), experiential action ("'He 
has met the chief"), hortative attitude ("He 
should go"), desiderative attitude ("If only he 
would come"), and so on In many languages, 
the only construction referring primarily to time 
IS one for the past tense. Such constructions, for 
which English often uses long phrases, are dis- 
tinguished in Niger-Kordofaman languages by a 
single prefix, suffix, or particle, or even by a 
slight modification of a pronoun or verb form 
On the other hand, passive constructions are 
rare or nonexistent in the non-Bantu languages 
of this family Prepositions are also rare, ideas of 
motion ("to, from, up") are typically incorpo- 
rated in verbs, while ideas of location ("under, 
beside, in") are typically incorporated in nouns 

With few exceptions, the languages of the 
Nilo-Saharan, Niger-Kordofanian, and Khoisan 
families, as well as the Chadic languages and a 
few of the Cushitic languages in the Afro-Asiatic 
family, are tone languages, that is, distinctions 
in the pitch of a single syllable may differentiate 
completely different words or different gram- 
matical functions of a word or of a prefix or suf- 
fix. For example, in a dialc'ct of Jukun, a lan- 
guage of Nigeria, kwT with a high pitch means 
"knife", kw7 with an intermediate pitch means 
"millstone", ancJ kwT with a low pitch means 
"chicken" In the same diatec t, ku bt with both 
syllables on an intermediate pitch means "He 
came", but ku bi with the first syllable on a high 
pitch means "Have him come". In scores of 
Niger-Congo languages, differcmt pronouns may 
differ only m pitch. Distinc tions m pitch or tone 
have generally been ignored m writing, m spite 
of the fact that they are often crucial to under- 
standing what the writer intended to say; tone is 
describeci, and indicated by accent marks or 
other devices, in a relatively fc*w modern gram- 
mars and dictionaries of African languages. 

Prior to 19S9, ac’*ademic involvement in Afri- 
can language studies was confined to a very few 
universitic^s in England ami Europe. Since then, 
a number of American universities, as well as 
the Foreign Service Institute of the U.S. Depart- 
memt of State*, have begun teaching and re- 
search programs focused on African languages. 
With less cwphasis on the implications of scien- 
tific linguistics for teaching and research, a 
number of other universities, colleges, and even 
high schools offer instruction m a single African 
language, usually Swahili. W.E.W. 

AFRICAN LITERATURE, oral and written liter- 
ature of the continent of Africa, not necessarily 
in the languages indigenous to Africa, 


Oral Literature. Africa has a rich and varied 
oral literature, which has grown since the begin- 
nings of African societies and continues to 
flourish even today The written literature of Af- 
rica has always shown a debt to the oral litera- 
ture, which takes a variety of forms Proverbs 
and riddles convey the accepted social codes of 
conduct, while myths and legends teach a belief 
m the supernatural as well as explain the origins 
and development of states, clans, and other im- 
portant social organizations Legends and myths 
are usually regarded as grounded m fact, in 
many instances, they have proven to be ex- 
tremely accurate accounts of the history of a 
people Folktales, on the other hand, are recog- 
nized as fiction The most famous African folk- 
tales have the tortoise, hare, and spider as their 
mam characters Similar folktales are wide- 
spread on the continent and have been carried 
from Africa to the Caribbean, Latin America, 
and the United States. 

In the 20th century, largely through the efforts 
of anthropologists and historians, a good por- 
tion of the oral literature of certain areas, such 
as Southern Africa, Ruanda, Buganda, and parts 
of the Congo region, have been recorded 
Early Written Literature. The earliest written 
African literature is North African Because of 
the intimate connections between North Africa 
and the Mediterranean and Arabic worlds, the 
writings of North Africans, such as those of the 
Christian theologian Saint Augustine and the 
Arab historian ibn-Khaldun (qq.v.), have had 
profound impacts beyond Africa. But because 
North African life and thought have been more 
closely tied to Europe and the Middle East than 
to the rest of Africa, the early literature of this 
part of the world should be treated with ancient 
Roman and Arabic literature. See Arabic Lan- 
CUACE AND Literature, Latin Literature 

Much of the early written literature of West 
Africa was influenced by Muslim writings, as 
transmitted by North Africans, in both form and 
content The earliest known West African works 
were 16lh-century writings by such Sudanese 
Muslim scholars as Abd al-Rahman al-Sadi 
(1596--about 1655), the author of Tankh as- 
Sudan ("History of the Sudan"), and Mahmud 
Kati (1468-?), who wrote Tankh al-Fettach. 
These works set down the oral traditions of the 
western Sudanic empires of Ghana, Malt, and 
Songhai m the style of Arabic histones. 

The earliest West African written poetry 
tended to be religious, and the best of it re- 
flected a familiarity with pre-lslamic Arabic po- 
etry as well as North African religious writing. 
Perhaps the most famous West African religious

AFRICAN LITERATURE 


poet was Abdullah ibn Muhammed Fudi (1767- 
1828), Emir of Gwandu and brother of Muslim 
reformer Shedu Uthman (about 1754-1817). 

The written literature of East Africa has an 
equally long history and also shows the influ- 
ence of Arabic models. An anonymous history 
' of the city-state of Kilwa Kisiwani, written about 
1520 in Arabic, is the earliest known example of 
East African written literature. Written Swahili 
versions of the histories of a number of city- 
states as well as "'message" poems, usually writ' 
ten with a moral or religious point of view, soon 
began to appear. The earliest-known original 
Swahili work, the epic poem U(endi wa Tarn- 
buka (""Story of Tambuka"), is dated 1728. 

Swahili poetry was largely derived from Ara- 
bic poetry. Swahili writers of epic verse bor- 
rowed from the romantic traditions surrounding 
the Prophet Muhammad (q.v.), and then freely 
elaborated on them to meet the tastc?s of their 
listeners and readers. By the 19th century, 
Swahili poetry had gone beyond the themes of 
Arabic works and had taken up such indigenous 
Bantu forms as ritual songs. 

The most famous Swahili poems dale from 
the 19th and 20th centuries. The greatest reli- 
gious poem, Utendi wa Inkishafi (""Sours Aw^ak « 
ening"), written by Sayyid Abdallah bin Nasir 
(about 1720-about 1820), illustrated the vanity 
of earthly life through an account of the fall of 
the city-state of Pate. The oral tradition of U* 
yongo, a 13th-century contendc^r for the throne 
of Shagga, was preserved in the epic poem 
Utendi wa Liyongo fumo {""Epic of Uyongo 
Fumo"), written by Muhammad bin Abubakar in 
1913. 

Although the Sudanic areas of West Africa 
and the coastal areas of East Africa had a m b 
written literature predating contact with Euro- 
peans, the literature of the rest of sub-Saharan 
Africa remained oral until the arrival of Europe* 
ans and the establishment of mission and gov 
ernment schools. 

Among the first Africans to write m English 
was Olaudah Equiano (fl. 18th cent.), who was 
kidnapped as a child from the Benin region of 
Nigeria and shipped to the United Slates as a 
slave. As a free man in Great Britain, he wrote an 
autobiography (1789) under the pen name of 
Gustavus Vasa. 

Contemporary literature* Near the begin- 
ning of the 20th century, Africans began to pub* 
fish creative writings in a number of African and 
European languages. In South' Africa a number 
of skilled poets and novelists appeared. Samuel 
E. K. Mqhayi- (1875-1945} wrote extensively in

S^jdar Senghor (q.v.), the poet-president of the 
Senegal Republic, led the Nigritude movement, 
which was extremely influential in shaping the 
thinking of French-speaking intellectuals. Nig- 
ritude, which reached its height in the 1930's 
and 1940's, was a protest against the French pol- 
icy of assimilation of black Africans into the 
French-Catholic way of life and a reassertion of 
the positive values of African culture. Birago 
Diop (1906- ) and David Diop (1927-60), both 
poets, were also associated with the movement. 


Only a few West African novelists produced 
works m French However, these writers have 
been among the most talented on the conti- 
nent Camara Laye (1928- ) of Guinea is re- 
markable for the psychological insights of his 
novels. His autobiographical novel L'Enfant Noir 
(1953, Eng. trans., The Dark Child, 1954) is con- 
sidered a masterpiece; his second work, written 
in 1954, was translated as The Radiance of the 
King in 1956. Cameroon has produced two nov- 
elists, Mongo Beti (1932- ) and Ferdinand 
Oyono (1929- ), who have written extremely 
powerful and searching satire 
West Africans writing m English produced lit- 
tle of note until the 1940's Since then, however, 
an impressive body of literature has been 
created. Nigeria m particular has many writers. 
Amos Tutuola (1920- ) and Chinua Achebe 
(1930- ) are the most important Nigerian nov- 
elists. Tutuola became internationally known 
after publication of The Palm-Wine Drunkard 
(1952). Written as legend and myth, the work 
has been compared by English critics with the 
allegorical masterpiece The Pilgrim's Progress by 
the English writer John Bunyan (q.v.). Achebe 
examined the threat posed by Western civiliza- 
tion to traditional values in his early novels 
Things Fall Apart (1958), No Longer at Ease 
{I960), and Arrow of God (1%4) A Man of the 
People {1%6) was a disturbing political satire on 
corruption m an unnamed African country.

m organizing the groups into a separate de- 
nomination, the African Methodist Episcopal 
Church Elected the first bishop, he was or- 
dained by the Anglo-American bishop, Francis 
Asbury (q.v), of the Methodist Episcopal 
Church Immediately after the Civil War, the de- 
nomination sent missionaries into the South 
Largely through their labors, the membership in- 
creased in ten years from 70,000 to 390,000 

According to the latest available figures, the 
African Methodist Episcopal Church reported 
more than 1,165,000 members and about 5875 
separate congregations It is the second-largest 
Methodist denomination in the U S 
AFRICAN METHODIST EPISCOPAL ZION 
CHURCH, Protestant denomination founded 
m New York City by a group of Negro congrega- 
tions formerly belonging to the Methodist Epis- 
copal Church its doctrine and polity are basi- 
cally Methodist (see Methodism), and its chief 
policy-making body is the quadrennial General 
Conference A bishop presides over each of the 
twelve episcopal areas. 

In addition to missionary activity within the 
United States, the < hur<h maintains missions in 
Africa, the West Indies, and South America. 
Publications include Star ot Zion, the Quarterly 
Review, and Missionary Seer 

In 17%, a group ot Negro parishioners of the 
)ohn Street Methodist Episcopal Church in New 
York City, discontented over the smallness of 
their role m the management of church affairs, 
organized a separate Negro congregation with 
the approval of the Anglo-American bishop, 
Francis Asbury (q.v.), of the Methodist Episcopal 
Church. Ihe group continued to meet in the 
john Street church until 16(X) when they erected 
their own building, which they calk'd Zion In 
1820 the group formally withdrew from the 
Methodist Episcopal Church, and in 1821, to- 
gether with congregations from Connecticut, 
New jersey, and Pennsylvania, held their annual 
conference at which James Vanck (1750?--1828), 
leader of the original dissenters, was elected the 
first bishop. It was not until 1848, however, that 
the name African Methodist Episcopal Zion 
Church was adopted 

This movement spread rapidly over the north- 
ern Slates, but its major growth followed the 
end of the Civil War; betwecm 1866 and 1868 its 
membership increased four-fold, the new re- 
cruits being largely southern Negroes. 

According to recent estimates the denomina- 
tion has 1,100,000 members and about 4600 sep- 
arate congregatiorts. The African Methodist 
Episcopal Zion Church is the third-largest Meth- 
odist organization in the U.S. 


AFRICAN MUSIC, music of the peoples of 
the continent of Africa (For the music of north- 
ern Africa, see Arabic Music ) Many styles of Af- 
rican music exist, all, however, share the charac- 
teristic of being used in daily life. Work songs, 
lullabies, farm songs, and songs for relaxation 
and entertainment are found throughout Africa. 
Music also is played at formal events, such as 
weddings, funerals, or religious ceremonies At 
these events, masked and costumed performers 
participate with onlookers, singing and dancing 
to the rhythmic accompaniment of instruments 
and drums 

Flighly developed and subtle rhythms are typ- 
ical of African music (See Music Elements of 
Music) Frequently, several beat patterns are 
played simultaneously during a performance In 
a group of musicians, a master drummer may 
serve as leader. He unifies the ensemble and 
signals to the dancers when a change in mood 
or tempo is about to take place The master 
drummer also plays intricate solo passages that 
contrast with or further develop the rhythmic 
patterns played by the other musicians 

Some master drummers can imitate speech on 
their instruments This is possible because in 
many African languages, the pitch at which a 
word IS spoken affects its meaning By duplicat- 
ing the pilch and accent patterns of spoken 
words and phrases, the drummer may recite leg- 
ends and tales. Instruments of the trumpet and 

7 he drum provides the basic rhythm of all African 
musK UPi 




AFRICAN MUSIC 


flute families are also used to imitate speech in 
this way 

African weddings or other ceremonies usuall> 
feature singing by a chorus, which can include 
anyone present at the event A soloist often 
leads the chorus in a series of alternating solo 
and choral sections Songs of praise are often 
performed for the nobility In them, long narra^ 
ttve poems describe the achievements of a 
chieftain and his forebears These narratives 
may be accompanied by a drum or flute, or 
''spoken'" by the drum itself. In many places 
special singers or drummers are ciesignatecJ 
perform such music regularly. 

African music makes use of an enormous van 
ety of percussion, string, and wind instruments 
In eastern Africa, players use large, bowl-shapeci 
drums covered with animal hides and a tight 
web of twined laces. Drumming styles have be*- 
come quite complex, especially in Ugancia, 
Small harps or lyres provide accompaniment tor 
solo songs, and ensembles of horn players en- 
liven many festivities In southeastern Africa, 
the Chopi of Mozambique have' developed 
large xylophone orchestras tn which instru 
ments cover all ranges from bass tcj soprano, 

Among the many types of drums found m the 
Congo area is a hollowed log with a slit m the 
upper surface, Dc'veloped to imitate speec h pat 
terns, this slit drum has been extensively used 
by some tribes for sending messages. I he Con 
golese also play various forms of stringed instru 
ments, including a type of zither and the arc hed 
harp. 

Instruments of weste^rn Africa include the 
dundun pressure drum, used among the Yoruba 
of Nigeria for imitating speech. This drum has a 
wooden body carved m the shape of an hour 
glass with drumheads stretcheci across either 
end and connected by thongs. The player grasps 
the thongs with one* hand and presses on them 
to change the pitch that sounds when the drum 
IS struck 

In Guinea and Mali, a stringed mstrumem 
called the kora is plucked in intricate solo 
pieces. In Ghana, the drumming styles of the 
Ashanti people feature a number of tndepench 
ent drum parts supporting the part of the master 
drummer. The players often use tall, standing 
drums of wood; the drum skms are held m place 
by wooden pegs. 

Many tribal groups in Africa sing for amuse 
ment or relaxation to the accompaniment at a 
small plucked instrument, sometimes called an 
mb/ra, or hand-piano, also used m solos. The 
mbira contains keys of metal, wood, or bamboo 
mounted on a flat surface with a sour>d box or 


gourd sometimes att.H hed iiu <uiditH>nal roso-

AGADIR 


African Elements, The Negro slaves in Amer- 
ica, as their ancestors m Africa had done for 
many centuries, used song or dance in almost all 
their daily activities — toil, celebrations, religious 
services From their African heritage the slaves 
adopted the patterns of their work songs, many 
of which were m a call-and-response form, a 
lead singer gave the line of melody and others 
joined in tor the refrain The same pattern, as 
well as some of the actual African tunes, was 
earned over also into the Atro-American spirit- 
ual (q V ) A vital feature of African folk music, 
the freedom allowed a performer to improvise 
elaborations of the melodic tine, continued, 
too, m the spirituals and m the so-called blues 
(q v ), Afro-Amencan folk music for a solo 
singer without chorus (see Foik Music) Also de- 
rived from an African heritage is drumming, m 
which several rhythmic patterns in different me- 
ters are combined simultaneously By contrast, 
the Western custom is to use only one meter at 
a time Fhe African interplay of different 
rhythms was carncnl over into the Afro-Ameri- 
can instrumental music < ailed }az7 (q.v,) 

The instruments that the c'‘arly slaves used in- 
cluded real or make'shift drums and the banjo 
(q V,), an Atric an variant of the guitar (q v.). The 
jagged mekKiic figurations that banjo players 
produce on the instrument were taken over into 
ragtime (q.v,), an Atro-American forerunner of 
jazz 

Some of the harmonic features of West Afri- 
can music contributed the '"blue" or ''dirty" 
notes to Afrc^-Amenc^an jazz These notes are 
the lowered third and seventh tones of the scale 
(q v.) In other ways the' harmony of Western 
and West African music are quite similar, which 
is the main reason that these two otherwise dif- 
ferent traditions could fuse into Afro-American 
music .

Western Elements. The* Amc^rican elements m 
Afro-American music are of European origin, for 
example, the use of Western instruments. Slaves 
who learned such instruments were highly 
pnzcMi by their American owners and often per- 
formeci European dance music at society balls. 
During the 19th century Negroes learned to play 
more and more instruments. The transference of 
Negrci rhythms and melodic improvisations to 
Western instruments was one of the major fac- 
tors m the formation of jazz. 

Another American element was hymn singing, 
particularly as taught by the Methodist and Bap- 
tist missionaries, who were more active than 
others in teaching Christianity to the Negroes. 
The American Negroes c reated their own 


hymns, sometimes called surge songs, in which 
they enlivened the music with spontaneous 
handclapping, melodic improvisation, and lively 
rhythms 

The Negroes, who have shown an extraordi- 
nary ability to assimilate widely differing musi- 
cal elements, have also made use of French, 
Spanish, and Caribbean music All of these mu- 
sical currents were present in New Orleans, La , 
where jazz was born around 1900, and each 
contributed to the vocabulary of jazz as it was 
evolved by Negro musicians. 

Current Sounds. In recent decades it has be- 
come increasingly difficult to isolate a distinct 
Afro-American music Throughout the world, 
folk music of all kinds has become increasingly 
rare in the 20th century The cross-influences of 
white and Negro jazz musicians from around 
the world make it impossible to speak of current 
jazz as either Afro or American The last vestiges 
of a living Afro-Amencan musical tradition 
might be found in the vigorous hymns that are 
sung in Negro churches and in the Negro folk 
music that still survives in some southern areas 
of the United States. 

AFZELIUS, Arvid August (1785-1871), Swed- 
ish writer, pastor, and collector of Swedish folk 
songs, born in Enkopmg, Sweden From 1828 
until his death he was pastor of the parish of En- 
koping In collaboration with the Swedish histo- 
rian and poet Erik Gustaf Geijer (q v), Afzelius 
compiled a collection of Swedish folk songs en- 
titled Svenska Folksvisor frin Forntiden ("Swed- 
ish Folk Tunes from Olden Times", 3 vol , 1814- 
17) His other works include poems, translations 
of ancient Swedish epic poetry, and a history of

AGADIR, city and seaport of the Kingdom of 
Morocco, on the Atlantic Ocean, about 120 
miles s.w of Marrakech, Situated within a min- 
ing region, cobalt, lead, manganese, and zinc 
are shipped by way of the excellent natural har- 
bor of the city The chief industries in Agadir are 
fishing, fish canning, and the manufacture of 
light metal products. The city was founded as a 
Portuguese settlement around 1500, and came 
under Moroccan rule about 1536. In 1911, at the 
height of the controversy caused by Franco- 
German rivalry m Morocco, Germany sent the 
warship Panther to Agadir. The incident, which 
nearly precipitated a general European war, led 
to the establishment of a French protectorate in 
Morocco in 1912. In 1960 Agadir was devastated 
by two earthquakes, about 15,000 persons m the 
area lost their lives Rebuilding of the city was 
begun shortly thereafter. Pop. (1971 est.) 61,192.

course of lectures at Lowell Institute, Boston, 
which resulted m his appointment in 1848 as 
professor of natural history m the Lawrence Sci- 
entific School of Harvard University Although 
his later life was given to lecturing and explora- 
tion rather than to teaching, he held this posi- 
tion until his death In opposition to the Dar- 
winian theory of evolution (q v ), Agassiz held 
the theory of epochs of creation His explora- 
tions in the United Stales included the Lake 
Superior region (1848) and the Florida coral 
reefs (1850-51) From 1865 to 1866 he traveled in 
Brazil His researches there were published 
under the title A journey in Brazil (1868) In 1872 
he made a journey to California around Cape 
Horn He established a summer school of zool- 
ogy in 1873 on Penikese Island, Buzzards Bay, 
Mass Agassiz was one of the best-informed and 
most capable biologists of his day, and his abil- 
ity to awaken interest in natural science was 
outstanding 

Alexander Agassiz (1835-1910), American zo- 
ologist, son of Louis Agassiz, born in NeuchStel, 
Switzerland, and educated at Harvard Univer- 
sity In 1873 he became curator of thc^ Museum 
of Comparative Zoology at Harvard. He held 
this post until 1885, when poor health forced 
him to resign As administrator of the Calumet 
and Hecia <X)pper mines on lake Superior 
(1865-69), and as a stockholder in the mines, he 
acquired a fortune. His gifts to the Harvard Mu- 
seum c^f Comparative Zoology and to other in- 
stitutions for biological rescMrch totaled over 
$1 ,CXX),(XX). In 1874-75 he explored Lake Titicaca, 
between Bolivia and Peru, and in 1875 estab- 
lished an aquarium at Newport, R I. From 1877 
to 1904 he made annual expeditions to study the 
marine life of the western Atlantic and the Pa- 
cific oceans. He was an authority on jellyfish, 
echinocierms, and corals. N.E.M. 

AGASSIZ, LAKE, immense glacial lake that 
formerly covered much of present-day n w. 
Minnesota and n. North Dakota and s.w. On- 
tario and $. Manitoba, Canada. The lake existed 
in the Pleistocene Epoch (see Quaternary Pe- 
riod) and was nameci in 1879 in honor of the 
naturalist Louis J. R. Agassiz (see under Agassiz). 
The historic existence of Lake Agassiz is indi- 
cated today by deltas, created where former riv- 
ers flowed into the lake, and by well-marked 
shorelines that can be traced for long distances. 
Lake Agassiz discharged only relatively small 
amounts of water because its natural drainage 
toward the n. was held back by the great Lau- 
rentide Ice Sheet. The outflow went through a 
channel 80 km (50 mr.) long from the s. end of 
the lake to the Minnesota R, and on to the Mis- 


sissippi R Because it retained so much water, 
the lake became very large, at its greatest extent 
It was about 1130 km (702 mi ) long and covered 
about 284,900 sq.km (110,000 sq mi ) Lake Agas- 
siz contracted drastically when the ice sheet 
melted sufficiently for an outlet to flow n via a 
channel (now the Nelson R ) to Hudson Bay 
Lake of the Woods and lakes Winnipeg, Winni- 
pegosis, and Manitoba remain as remnants of 
Lake Agassiz Most of the former lake bed is 
now a fertile plain where much gram is pro- 
duced. 

AGATE, mineral composed of layers of quartz 
(q v ), generally of different colors It usually oc- 
curs as rounded nodules or veins m traprock, 
the layers are often concentric The composi- 
tion of agate varies greatly, but silica is always 
predominant, usually with alumina and oxide of 
iron Chalcedony, carnelian, amethyst, common 
quartz, jasper, opal, and flint occur as layers in 
agate. Among other forms of agate are star 
agate, clouded agate, with nebulous inclusions, 
and moss agate, with dark-colored dendritic in- 
clusions. Agate can be polished to a high gloss, 
and IS much used for ornamental purposes

many minerals mentioned 
AGATE FOSSIL BEDS NATIONAL MONU- 
MENT, site of a rich deposit of fossil skeletons 
of extinct mammals in NW Nebraska The monu- 
ment is m low-lying hills above the course of 
the Niobrara R near the border with Wyoming 
The mammals lived in the Miocene Epoch (q v.). 
Age of Mammals, some 13 to 25 million years 
ago. Among the fossil remains are a two-horned 
rhinoceros {Diceratherium), a Terrible Pig (D/- 
nohyus), and a tmy deerlike creature (Stenomy- 
lus). The name agate refers to nearby rock for- 
mations; the fossils themselves are imbedded 
principally in sandstone, on Carnegie and Uni- 
versity hills The monument, of approximately 
3000 acres, was established in 1965 
AGATHA, Saint (fl. 3rd cent), according to 
tradition, a noble Sicilian virgin of great beauty 
and wealth, who rejected the love of a Roman 
consul and as a result suffered a cruel martyr- 
dom She holds a high rank among the saints of 
the Roman Catholic Church Whether Agatha 
ever lived, and, if so, whether she died m the 
persecution of Christians conducted during the 
reign of the Roman emperor Decius (201-51) or 
that of Diocletian (q.v), fifty years later, is un- 
known She IS the patron samt of Malta and of 
Catania, Italy Legend relates that several times 
the mere carrying of her veil (taken from her 
tomb in Catania) in procession averted erup- 
tions of nearby Mt Etna, and that her interces-

AGATHOCLES (361-289 bx:.), tyrant of Syra- 
cuse, a Greek city in Sicily, born in Thermae 
Himerenses (now Termini Imerese), Sicily. After 
being exiled twice for attempting to overthrow 
the aristocratic government, he succeeded in 
317 B.c. in his third attempt and became tyrant of 
all of Sicily. Agathocles continued the policy of 
previous Syracusan rulers of constantly warring 
with the Carthaginians; he threatened the city 
of Carthage itself in 310 b.€. His rule appears to 
have been popular and enlightened. Agathocles 
assumed the title of king in .304 bc later he 
formed an alliance with Ptolemy I (see umier 
ProiEMY), ruler of Egypt. He raided Italy and in 
299 B.c. conquered the island of Corcyra (now 
Kerkira) in the Adriatic Sea. In his wilt Agath 
odes provided for the restoration of the govern 
ment to the people of Syrac use.

AGENCY FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOP- 
MENT, known as A l.D , agency of the Depart- 
ment of State responsible for carrying out non- 
military. United States foreign-assistance 
programs It was created in 1961 to combine 
economic and technical assistance operations 
of the International Cooperation Administra- 
tion, the loan activities of the Development 
Loan Fund, and the local currency-lending func- 
tions of the Export-Import Bank of the United 
States (q v ) 

The Agency for International Development 
has four regional bureaus Far East, Near East 
and South Asia, Africa, and Latin America The 
assistant secretary who heads A. l.D is also coor- 
dinator for the Alliance for Progress (q.v ) On 
an equal administrative level is the Office of the 
War on Hunger, created in 1967, which coordi- 
nates food grants to countries unable to pro- 
duce enough food for their citizens 

The A, l.D programs are directed to some sev- 
enty developing countries Much of the aid in- 
volves contributing U.S. goods and services for 
specific activities, rather than granting money 
outright The agency provides aid in the form of 
financial loans to help develop specific social 
and economic projects and general importation 
programs to foster economic growth and tech- 
nical assistance and training It also provides 
funds to assist nations during times of political 
emergency.

ACESILAUS 


AGESILAUS H (about 444-'3t>() b.c), King ot 
Sparta (about 400“360 bc ), son of King Archida- 
mus II (see under Archidamus), and the succes- 
sor of his half brother, King Agis 1! (r. about 
426-399 B.c,). After Agesilaus became king, he 
took command of the forces in Asia Minor that 
were defending the Greek cities from the Per- 
sians. He won several battles but was recalled to 
defend Sparta against a hostile alliance of Ath- 
ens, Thebes, Argos, and Corinth. Agesilaus was 
victorious against the alliance at the battle of 
Coronea, in Boeotia, in 394 b.c. He continued to 
lead his state in wars against other Greek states, 
especially Thebes. Despite the defeat of the 
Spartans at Leuctra in 371 bc,, where Cleom- 
brotus 1 (r. 380-371 B.c.), coruler of Sparta, was in 
command, Agesilaus continued to make war. He 
died on his way home from leading a mercenary 
expedition in Egypt against the Persians. 
AGGADA, See Hagcada, 

AGINCOURT, BATTIE OF, military engage 
ment fought in France during the Hundred 
Years' War (q.v.), on Oct. 25, 1415, between an 
army under Henry V (q.v.), King of England, and 
a French army under Charles d'AIEjret (d. 141$), 
constable of France. Prior to the action, which 
took place in a narrow valley near the village of 
Agincourt (now Azincourt, in Pas^de-Calais De- 
partment), Henry, a claimant to the French 
throne, had invaded France and seized the port 
of Harfleur. At the time of the action Henry's 
army, weakened by disease and hyngi^r, was en^ 
route to Calais, from which Henry planned to 
embark for England. In the course of the march 
to Calais the English force, which numbefed 
about 6000 men, for the most part fighify 
equipped archers, was intercepted by lO'Alforet, 
whose army of about 25,000 men consisted 
chiefly of armored cavalry and infantry contin- 
gents. The English king, fearful of annihilation, 
sought a truce with the French, but his terms 
were rejected, in the battle, which was pre* 
ceded by heavy rains, the French troops were at 
a disadvantage because of their weighty armor, 
the narrowness of the battteground, the muddy 
terrain, and the faulty tactics of thc^ir superiors,, 
notably in using massed formations against a 
mobile enemy. The French cavalry, which occu- 
pied frontal positions, quickly tecame mired in 
the m^ud, making easy targets .for the inglish 
archers. After, routing the enemy . cavalry, the 
English troops, wielding hatchets, billhooks (.a 
type of knife), and swords, launched successive 
assaults on the French infantry. Demorafizeci by 
the-fate of their cavalry and severely hampered 
by the mud, the French foot soldiers were com- 
pletely overwhelmed. D'Aibrel,. several dukes

AGOULT 


was elected Baltimore County Executive. Four 
years later he won the Maryland governorship 
In 1968 and again in 1972 Agnew was elected 
Vice-President under Richard Milhous Nixon 
(q V ) As Vice-President he was a member of 
the National Security Council (q v ), the Na- 
tional Aeronautics and Space Council, and the 
Urban Affairs Council 

Resignation. In August, 1973, Agnew acknowl- 
edged that he was under investigation by the 
office of the United States attorney in Balti- 
more But he denied all charges, which included 
bribery, extortion, tax fraud, and conspiracy He 
requested a Congressional investigation of the 
charges, but his request was tabled Late in Sep- 
tember, when a Federal grand jury in Baltimore 
began hearing evidence against the Vice-Presi- 
dent, a dramatic series of legal actions and pub- 
lic statements ensued. On Oct lO, the attorney 
general of the U.S., Flliot L(ee) Richardson, 
entered charges in the Baltimore court 
that Agnew had asked for and accepted cash 
payments totaling more than $1CX),000 while 
holding office as county executive, governor, 
and Vice-President Agnew thereupon pleaded 
nolo contendere (no contest) to a single charge 
of Federal income tax evasion in 1%7; he de- 
nied all other c harges. Agnew was fined $10,000 
and sentenced to three years of unsupervised 
probation. Immediately before this courtroom 
action he had resigned, becoming the first Vice- 
President of the U S. to give up his office be- 
cause of criminal charges. 

In May, 1974, Agnew was barred from the 
practice of law by the Maryland State Court of 
Appeals. He had meanwhile become a consult- 
ant m international trade 
AGNON, Shmuel Yosef Halevi^ original sur- 
name C/AC/KES (1888-1970), Israeli writer, 
b()rn in Buc/aez, Galicia, then part of the Aus- 
tro-Hungarian Empire, Educated at home and at 
the local Hebrew school, he published his first 
poetry, written in both Hebrew and his native 
Yiddish, at the age of fifteen. In 1908 he emi- 
grated to Palestine, settling in Jerusalem in 1910. 
Except for two stays in Germany, from 1912 to 
1924 and from 19i() to 1952, Agnon lived in Israel 
until his death. In I95S he was named the first 
recipient of the Bialik Prize* in Hebrew litera- 
ture, regarded as the most prestigious literary 
prize in Israel In 1966, Agnon and the German- 
Swedish writer Nelly Sachs (q.v.) shared the 
Nobel Prize in literature Agnon was cited for 
his ^^profoundiy characteristic narrative art with 
motik tom the life of the lewish people'l 

Unlike other authors writing m Hebrew or 
Yiddish who attempt to fit their stories into the 


mainstreams of European culture, Agnon ex- 
pressed m his writings the 18th-century tradi- 
ticjns of Gahcian Jews. His stories, written in a 
simple but allusive style and deeply religious in 
feeling, are rich in Jewish folk legends and mys- 
ticism They note the gradual decline of the Ga- 
lician Jewish communities between the time of 
his youth and the beginning of World War I In 
the same way, the stories of Agnon that are set 
m Palestine and Israel illustrate the differing 
outlooks of the religious and idealistic early 
Jewish settlers of Palestine and the largely secu- 
lar present-day Israelis Among his most ad- 
mired works are his novels Ha~Khnassat Kallah 
(1931; Eng. trans.. The Bridal Canopy, 1937) and 
Oreah Nata la-Lvn (1937, Eng trans , A Guest for 
the Night, 1968), and the collected work 
Twenty-one Stones (1970) 

AGNOSTICISM, doctrine that the existence 
of Cod and other spiritual beings is neither cer- 
tain nor impossible The term, derived from the 
Greek agnostikos ("'not knowing"), was intro- 
duced into English in the 19th century by the 
British biologist Thomas Henry Huxley (see 
under Huxley). The agnostic position is distinct 
from both theism (q.v ), which affirms the exist- 
ence of such beings, and atheism (q v ), which 
cienies their existence 

Although usually regarded as a form of skepti- 
cism (qv.), agnosticism is more limited m 
scope, for it denies the reliability only of meta- 
physical and theological beliefs rather than of 
all beliefs The basis of modern agnosticism lies 
m the works of the British philosopher David 
Hume and the German philosopher Immanuel 
Kant (qq.v.), both of whom pointed out logical 
fallacies in the traditional arguments for the ex- 
istence of God and of the soul. Another school 
of modern philosophy which, like agnosticism, 
rejects both atheism and theism, is empiricism 
(q.v.), also known as logical positivism, which 
maintains that metaphysical statements are 
meaningless R.A 

AGORA, in ancient Greece, the public square 
or marketplace of a city, used as the site of pop- 
ular assembly. Large and open, the agora was re- 
garded as the center of political, commercial, 
religious, and social activities in the city It was 
surrounded by the public buildings and tem- 
ples. The most famous is the Athenian agora, lo-

she bore three daughters. One of the daughters, 
Cosima (1837-1930), married successively the 
German conductor Hans von Bulow and the 
German composer Richard Wagner (qq*v.). 
Among the works of the Comtesse d'Agoult are 
the semiautobiographical romance Nelida 
(1845), Lettres Repubticaines {"'Republican let- 
ters'', 1848), Histoire de la Revolution de 184S 
("Story of the Revolution of 1848", 1851-53), and 
Mes Souvenirs, 1806-33 ("My Memories, 18CX3-

("Ethical and Political Sketches", 1849) is con- 
sidered her best work. 

AGOUTI, common name for rodents of the 
genera Dasyprocta and Myoprocta, constituting 
the family Dasyproctidae. The agouti is found in 
forested regions from southern Mexico south to 
Paraguay, and in the West Indies. It is short 
eared, has practically no tail, and has a soft coat 
of golden-brown or reddish hair, sometimes 
speckled. The agouti is approximately the she 
of a rabbit. At first glance the agouti resembles 
the guinea pig, but it has slender, comparativeiv 
long legs and can run swiftly. The agouti lives in 
an underground den, from which it emerges 
usually at night. It feeds on green leaves, roots,

and fallen fruit. Esteemed for its flesh and hated 
in farming areas because of its destructiveness,, 
the agouti is hunted and killer! in great num- 
bers. The agouti reproduces rapicily, however, 
the female usually has two Ituers of two w four 
young each year. Born open-eyed and fylly 
furred, the young agouti is ready to look after it- 
self immediately.

AGRICULTURAL CHEMISTRY, branch of 
chemical science that deals with the nutrition of 
plants and farm animals, an<i with the produc- 
tion of food for human consumption at the least 
possible cost in money, labor, and natural re- 
sources Agricultural chemistry is also some- 
times concerned with use of agricultural prod- 
ucts in the manufacture of substances valuable 
for purposes other than food, but these non- 
food purposes are more properly a branch of 
the science ot chemurgy (q.v.). 

With the exception of water and air, plants 
draw all of their food constituents from properly 
fertilized soil, see FfRTiii/ER Soil analysis and fer- 
tilizer analysis are therefore important fields of 
agricultural chemistry. The principal substances 
needed by plants are nitrogen, potassium, and 
phosphorus, and these elements make up the 
bulk of most fertilizers. Fertilizers may consist of 
the wastes and by-products from meat-packing 
houses and related trades, or may be mixtures of 
synthetic chemicals. The principal nitrogen- 
containing substances employed m the manu- 
facture of modern fertilizers are ammonia and 
its solutions, ammonium nitrate, ammonium 
phosphate, ammonium sulfate, calcium cyana- 
mide, sodium nitrate, manures, urea, and ac- 
tivated sludge from sewage. The principal 
phosphorus-containing ingredients include am- 
monium phosphate, ordinary superphosphate, 
and triple superphosphate. Potassium-contain- 
ing ingredients include manure salts, potassium 
chloride, and sulfate of potash. Sulfur and cal- 
cium (lime) must also sometimes be added to 



An iigfic ultural (hemi*>t examines the ettects ot differ- 
ing amounts ot fertilizer on similar plants upi 


fertilizers Other elements, notably magnesium, 
iron, and aluminum, may be needed m small 
quantities, but are invariably present in the soil 
Recently it has been discovered that certain 
other substances are needed in extremely mi- 
nute quantities, and that their absence causes 
severe deficiency diseases of plants The most 
important of these so-called trace elements 
(q.v.) IS boron; other essential trace elements 
are copper, manganese, zinc, and molybdenum 
The mineral needs of plants have now been so 
thoroughly ascertained that it is possible to 
grow plants of good quality m water instead of 
soil if they are fed with a solution of the correct 
mineral substances, m proper proportions and 
at a proper rate; see Hydroponics. The acidity 
(pH) of the soil or other medium has an impor- 
tant influence on the ability of the plant to as- 
similate nutrients. 

The analysis of foods is an important activity 
of the agricultural chemist. In most cases he de- 
termines the amounts of protein, carbohydrates, 
fat, minerals, and vitamins present, since these 
are the important substances from the view- 
point of the nutritionist. Sometimes he must de- 
termine the presence of adulterants or of con- 
taminants produced by insecticides and other

AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION 


chemicals employed during the growing season. 

The discovery, preparation, and use ot various 
pest killers which save millions of dollars' worth 
of agricultural products annually, lie in the prov* 
ince of the agricultural chemist. In recent years 
numerous highly efficient chemicals for this 
purpose have been developed. Among the best 
known are the Insecticides (see iMSiCTiaDt) arse* 
nious oxide, calcium arsenate, lead arsenate, 
pyrethrum, rotenone, parathion, DDT (q.v.), 
paradichlorbenzene, and 66t> benzene 

hexachloride, also known as lindane); weed kilf^ 
ers such as sodium arsenite, borax, calcium cy- 
anamide, sodium chloride, and 2,4-0 {see 
WEtDS); rodenticldes such as ANTLi (alpha 
naphthyl thiourea) and KBO (sodium fluoroace- 
tate); and fungicides such as lime sulfur, Bor- 
deaux mixture, Spergon and Puratized H^; see 
Fungicide. 

In view of the increasing evidence of the ad- 
verse effect on wildlife and of contamination ol 
the environment, strong doubts have been ex> 
pressc?d by conservationists and some scientists 
about the use of long-lasting pesticides such as 
DDT, dieldrin, and heptachlor. 

Chemicals that promote the growth of plants 
and animals were discovered in the iqSCTs, and 
many were synthesized in the 19C>CTs. Plant- 
growth regulators, known as auxins, are gener- 
ally organic acids with an unsaturated cyclic nu 
cleus, or compounds derived from these acids. 
An example is 2,4-D (2,4-<lichlorophenoxva- 
cetic acid); in low concentrations this cone 
pound stimulates the growth of broadTeafeti 
plants, but at high concentrations it so drastr 
calty alters the physiologic prcicesses of the 
plant that it is highly toxic. The compound does 
not affect narrow-leafed or monocotyledonous 
plants, such as grasses and cereals; therefore it 
kills weeds without harming economically use- 
ful plants. 

in that the substances with which agrk yltural 
chemistry deals are produc ts of living organ- 
isms, or agents to destroy or ac celebrate the* 
growth of such organisms, tbt* sui)je(t is really 
an applied form of biochemistry (c|.v.). Thus, the 
agricultural chemist is an agriculturist when he 
is in the field, and a physiological chemist when 
he is in the laboratory. See ACRicut luitt For the

Modern large agfkyltural implements, adapt- 
ed to large-scale farming methods, are usually 
operated by motor^driven prime movers. The 
principal prime mover of modern agriculture is 
the tractor (q.v.), which provides loc amotion for 
other implements and can furnish power for op- 
eration of machines drawn behind the tractor in 
the field. The power shafts of tractors may also 
be harnessed to bells for operating such equip- 
ment as feed grinders, pumps, or electric-power

Implements for Growing Crops. Many types 
of implements have been developed for break- 
ing ground, planting, tilling, weeding, fertiliz- 
ing, and combating pests 

Ground is broken by plows to prepare the 
seedbed. A plow consists of a bladehke plow- 
share that cuts under the soil, and a curved 
moldboard, against which the soil is lifted, 
turned, and pulverized. Modern tractor plows 
are equipped usually with two or more plow- 
shares, so that a wide area of ground may be 
broken at a single sweep. Harrows are used to 
smooth plowed land and sometimes to cover 
seeds and fertilizers. The disk harrow, which has 
curved, sharp-edged steel disks, is used mainly 
to cut up crop residues before plowing and to 
uproot w(*eds after sowing A roller Is used to 
break up clods of soil to Improve the aeration 
and water-hold capacity of the soil. 

Planting of some cereal crops is still accom- 
plished by broadcasting seed. Machines for 
broadcasting usually consist of a long seedbox 
mounted on wheels and equipped with an agi- 
tator to disperse the seed. Broadcast seeds are 
not always covered by a uniform or sufficient 
depth of soil, and so seeding is more often done 
with drills, which produce continuous furrows 
of uniform depth as seedbeds The rate of sow- 
ing is adjustable in modern drills, but special- 
ized implements called planters are necessary 
for sowing crops such as corn, which are 
planted in rows. Corn planters and other similar 
machines have a special feed wheel that picks 
up separate kernels or small quantities of grain 
and places them in the ground. 

Fertilizer may be distributed during the win- 
ter or shortly before seeding time, but commer- 
cial fertilizers commonly are distributed, along 
with seeds, by drills and planters. Manure and 
other consolidated fertilizers are distributed 
most efficiently by a manure spreader, which is 
a wagon equipped with a bottom conveyor to

carry the fertilizer back to a beater attachment, 
which disintegrates and strews it on the ground. 

After crops have begun to grow, a cultivator 
(q.v.) is used to destroy weeds (q.v.) and loosen 
and aerate the soil. A flame weeder, which pro-* 
duces a hot-air blast, can be used to destroy 
weeds in crops such as cotton, the stems of 
which have tough bark. Selective chemical her- 
bicides applied in the form of a spray or as grarv 
ules are used extensively for destruction of 
weeds. Insecticides also are applied to the soil 
and to crops in the form of granules, dust, or liq- 
uid sprays; see iNsrcTtaor. A variety of mechani- 
cal spraying and dusting equipment is used to 
spread chemicals on crops and fields; the ma- 
chin€>ry may be self-powered or drawn and 
powered by a tractor. In areas where large crops 
of vegetables and grain are grown, airplanes are 
increasingly used to dust or spray insecticide. 
This method is important in locust control. Air- 
planes are also used in New Zc^aland to spread 
fertilizer on pastureland. See Woos 
Impfements for Harvesting Crops. Machin 
ery used for harvesting differs with the crop. 
Most cereal crops are harv<‘sted by m<Mns of a 
combine, which is a machine equipped to re 
move the fruiting heads, beat off £ht‘ gram ker 
nels, and clean the grain as the combine moves 
through the fields. The cleaned gram isaccumy 
lated in an attached grain tank. 

Corn for grain is harvested by rwMns of a 
corn picker or a grain comijine with a corn 
picker attachment. As the corn picker moves 
along the rows, the ears arc* pickc»d from the 
stalks and are husked. The ears may be irans 
ferred from the husking bed in the picker eithi^r 
to a sheller, which removes the kernc^ls from the 
ear, mounted on the pic ker or to a wagon trail 
ing behind the machine*. When a combine is 
utilized, the whole* cornstalk may be put 
through the machine* to shell the ears, or thi* at- 
tachment may simply snap the t*ars from the 
stalks and feed them lo the combine for shell- 
ing. Recently cJev<*k)pc*d corn combines are ca-- 
pable of picking, husking, and shelling yp to SOIT 
by. of corn per hour. 

Hay harvesting usually is a multipie operation 
because of the necessity of drying the hay after 
cutting it Hay is first cut dose to the ground 
with a mower. After drying, most hay is baled, 
although some is still put up as loose hay. In bal- 
ing, the pickup baler lilts the hay to a conveyor 
that carries it to a baling chamber m which It is 
compressed into bales weighing up to 12S ib. 
and automalicatly tied with heavy twine or wire.

relating to the production and use of agricul- 
tural commodities, it is responsible for the con- 
trol and eradication of plant and animal dis- 
eases Headquarters for much of the research of

AGRICULTURE, art, science, and industry of 
growing plants and animals beneficial to man- 
kind. In a broad sense agriculture includes 
cultivation of the soil (see Soils and Soil Man- 
agement), growing and harvesting crops (see 
Horticulture), livestock breeding and raising 
(see Animal Husbandry, below), dairying, and 
forestry (qq v.). The packing, processing, and 
marketing of agricultural products are closely 
related activities. Agriculture depends heavily 
on engineering, technology, and the biological 
and physical sciences. Irrigation, drainage, con- 
servation (qq.v.), sanitation, and mechanization, 
each of which is important in successful farm- 
ing, are some of the fields requiring the special- 
ized knowledge of agricultural engineers. Plant 
breeding (q.v.) contributes immeasurably to 
farm productivity. Agricultural chemistry (qv.) 
deals with other vital farm problems, for exam- 
ple, the uses of fertilizer, insecticide (qq.v.), and 
fungicide (see Fungi; fungicides), composition 
of soils, analysis of agricultural products, and 
nutritional requirements of farm animals. Ge- 
netics (see Heredity) has placed livestock breed- 
ing on a scientific basis. Hydroponics (q.v,), a 
method of soilless gardening in which plants are 
grown m chemical nutrient solutions, may solve 
additional agricultural problems; see also Algae 
Science has also influenced the processing and 
distribution of agricultural products; methods of 
quick-freezing and dehydration have increased 
the markets for farm products; see Food Preser- 
vation. Airplanes and helicopters are employed 
m agriculture for such purposes as seeding, 
transporting perishable products, fighting forest 
fires, and in spraying operations involved in 
insect and disease control. Radio and television 


disseminate vital weather reports and other 
information that is of concern to farmers 

Mechanization, the outstanding characteristic 
of late 19th- and 20th-century agriculture, has 
eased much of the backbreaking toil of the 
farmer More significantly, mechanization has 
enormously increased farm efficiency and pro- 
ductivity See Agricultural Machinery 
WORLD AGRICULTURE 
The importance of agriculture can hardly be 
overstated More than 50 percent of the world's 
labor force is employed in agriculture The dis- 
tribution m the early 1970's ranged from 75 
percent of those employed in Africa to less than 
5 percent in North America In Western Europe, 
the figure was about 17 percent, in Eastern 
Europe and the Soviet Union, about 32 percent, 
and m Asia, about 68 percent 

Farm size varies widely from region to region 
For example, the average for Canadian farms is 
about 460 acres per farm, in the United States, 
about 375 acres The average size of a single 
landholding in the Philippines, however, may 
be somewhat less than 9 acres, and in Indo- 
nesia, a little less than 3 acres 

Size also depends on the purpose of the farm. 
Commercial farming, or production for cash, is 
usually done on large holdings The latifundia of 
Latin America are large privately owned estates 
worked by tenant labor. Single-crop plantations 
produce tea, rubber, and cocoa Wheat farms 
are most efficient when they comprise some 
thousands of acres and can be worked by teams 
of men and machines. Australian sheep stations 
and other livestock farms must be large to 
provide grazing facilities for thousands of ani- 
mals Collective farms owned and operated by 
state employees, as in the Soviet Union, or the 
agricultural plots of a Chinese commune 
(q.v.), or the cooperative farms held by Peru- 
vian communities are other necessarily large 
units. 

Individual subsistence farms or small-family 
mixed-farm operations are decreasing m num- 
ber m developed countries but are still numer- 
ous in the developing countries of Africa and 
Asia. 

Nomadic herdsmen range over large areas m 
sub-Saharan Africa, Afghanistan, and Lapland; 
and herding is a major part of agriculture in 
such areas as Mongolia 

The conditions that determine what will be 
raised in an area include climate, water supply, 
and terrain. For more detailed information, see 
such articles as Climate, Ecology, Water Supply 
and Waterworks

food value of wild plants and animals an<i ilo- 
mesticated and bred many varieties oi them 
Those that are most important are cereals su< h 
as wheat, rice, barley, torn, and rye, sugarcane 
and sugar beets, meat animals such as siwep, 
cattle, goats, and pigs or swme, poultry (c|.v ) 
such as chickens, ducks, and turkeys, arxi sue h 
products as milk, cheese, eggs, nuts, and oils 
Fruits, vegetables, and olives are also mafot

Agricultural income is also derived trom non 
food crops such as rubber, fiber plants, tohaito, 
and oilseeds used in synthc'tic chemical com 
pounds, as well as fur (q.v ) and tree crops, Soe

Much of the forc=>^tgn exchange earned by a 
country may be derived from a single commod- 
ity; for example, Ce^ylon dc^pends upon tea, 
Denmark specializes in dairy produc ts, Australia 
in wool, and New Zealand and Argentina in 
meat products 

The importance of an individual country as 
an exporter of agricultural products cic^pc^nds on 
many factors. Among them is the possibility that 
the country is too little developcnf industrially to 
produce much of anything c‘lse Such exporters 
include Ghana, with cacao, and Burma, with 
nee. Or an exceptionally wt*ll»develofied ccjun 
try may produce surpluses not needed by its 
own population; this has been trut* of the II S., 
Canada, and some of the Wc'stern European 
countries. 

Because nations depend on agriculture not 
only for food, but for national income and raw 
materials for industry as well, trade in agricul- 
ture IS a constant international concern It is 
regulated by international agreemertts such as 
the General Agreemcmt on Tariffs and trade amJ 
by trading areas such as the furopc^an £< onomte 
Community (qq.v,). The Food and Agnculture 
Organization of the United Nations {q.v.) do 
rects much of its attention to such trade; see 
also Food 

The sections on Agnculture contained in 
individual continent and country articles cover 
regional and national agriculture in more detail

and the U.S. and provinces of Canada. 
HISTORY 

The history of agnculture may, for discussion 
purposes, be divided into four periods, of un- 
equal length, differing m date according to 
region.

Ukraine The llama and alpaca were domesti- 
cated in the Andean regions of South America 
by the middle of the 3rd millennium bc 

According to carbon dating, wheat and barley 
were domesticated in the Near East m the 7th 
millennium bc, millet and rice in China and 
southeastern Asia by 30CX) bc, and corn and 
beans m Mexico about 7000 bc Legumes found 
m Thessaly and Macedonia are dated as early as 
6000 BC Flax was grown and apparently woven 
into textiles early in the Neolithic period 

The farmer began, most probably, by noting 
which of the wild plants around him were 
edible or otherwise useful and learned to save 
the seed and to replant it m cleared land Long 
cultivation of the most prolific and hardiest 
plants yielded a stable strain. Herds of goats and 
sheep were assembled from captured young 
wild animals, and those with the most useful 
traits — such as small horns, high milk yield, 
etc — were bred. The aurochs seems to have 
been the ancestor of European cattle, an Asian 
wild ox, of the zebu (q.v ), the humpc'd cattle of 
Asia. The cat, dog, and chicken were domesti- 
cated very early. The transition from hunting 
and food gathering to a dependence upon food 
production was gradual, and in a few isolated 
parts of the world has not yet been accom- 
plished. Crops and domestic meat supplies were 
augmented by fish and wildfowl as well as by 
meat of wild animals 

The Neolithic farmers lived in simple dwell- 
ings — in caves and in small houses of sunbaked 
muci brick or of reed and woocJ These homes 
were grouped into small villages, or they might 
be single farmsteads surrounded by fields, shel- 
tering animals and humans in adjacent or joined 
buildings; see Housi: f/cstory, late m the Neo- 
lithic period, cities such as jericho and Ur 
(qq.v.) were made possible by the production of 
agricultural surpluses. 

Pastoralism may have* been a later develop- 
ment. ft would seem that mixed farming, com- 
bining cultivation of < rops and stock raising, 
was the most common Neolithic pattern. No- 
madic herdsmen, however, roamed the steppe 
lands of Europe and Asia, where the horse and 
camel were domesticated. 

The earliest tools of the farmer were of wood 
and stone. They included the stone adz; the 
sickle or reaping knife with sharpened stone 
blades, used to gather grain; the digging stick, 
used to plant seeds, and, with later adaptations, 
as a spade or hoe; and a rudimentary plow, a 
modified tree branch used to scratch the sur- 
face of the soil and prepare it for planting. The 
plow was later adapted for pulling by oxen. 


The hilly areas of southwestern Asia and the 
forests of Europe had enough ram to sustain 
agriculture, but Egypt depended upon the an- 
nual floods of the Nile to replenish soil moisture 
and fertility The inhabitants of the so-called 
Fertile Crescent, around the Tigris and Eu- 
phrates rivers, also depended upon annual 
floods to supply irrigation water Drainage was 
necessary to prevent the carrying off of land 
from the hillsides through which the rivers ran 
The Hwang Ho farmers developed a system of 
irrigation and drainage to control the damage 
caused to their fields m the flood plain of the 
meandering river 

Although the Neolithic settlements were 
more permanent than the camps of hunting 
populations, villages had to be moved periodi- 
cally in some areas, as the fields lost their 
fertility from continuous cropping This was 
most necessary in northern Europe, where fields 
were produced by the slash-and-burn method 
of clearing The settlements along the Nile, 
however, were more permanent, because the 
river deposited fertile silt annually.

Historicai Agriculture through the Roman 
Period. With the close of the Neolithic period 
and the introduction of metals, the age of in- 
novation in agriculture was largely over The 
historical period — known through written and 
pictured materials, including the Bible (qv), 
Near Eastern records and monuments, and Chi- 
nese, Greek, and Roman writers — was devoted 
to improvement A few high spots must serve to 
outline the development of worldwide agricul- 
ture in this era, roughly defined as 2500 bc to 
500 AD For a similar period of development in 
Central and South America, somewhat later in 
date, see American Indians 

Some plants became newly prominent 
Grapes and wine were mentioned m Egyptian 
records about 2900 bc, and trade m olive oil 
and wine was widespread in the Mediterranean 
area in the 1st millennium sc Rye and oats were 
cultivated in northern Europe about 1000 bc 

Many vegetables and fruits, including onions, 
melons, and cucumbers, were grown by the 3rd 
millennium bc in Ur Dates and figs were an 
important source of sugar m the Near East, and 
apples, pomegranates, peaches, and mulberries 
were grown in the Mediterranean area Cotton 
was grown and spun in India about 2000 bc, 
and linen and silk were used extensively m 
2nd-millennium China. Felt was made from the

BC, was already known in Mesopotamia and 
Asia Minor The ox-drawn tour-wheeletJ tart tor 
farm work and two-wheeled chariots drawn h> 
horses were familiar m northern India in the inti 
millennium 8 c See a/so Wnat 

Improvements in tools and implements were 
particularly important. Metal tools were longer 
lasting and more efficient, and cultivation was 
greatly improved by such aids as the ox-drawn 
plow fitted with an iron-tipped point, noted in 
the 10th century bc m Palestine. In Mesof>ota 
mia in the 3rd millennium hc a tunnellike 
device was attached to the plow to aid in 
seeding, and other early fc^rrns ol drills were 
used in China. Threshing was cione with animal 
power in Palestine and Mesopotamia, although 
reaping, binding, and winnowing were still 
done by hand. Egypt retamed Hand seeding 
through this period, on mdiviciual farm plots 
and large estates alike. 

Storage methods for oil anci gram were im 
proved. Granaries — jars, dry cisterns, silos, and 
bins of one sort or another contammg stored 
gram-— supported c tty populations. Indeecf, 
without adequate food supplies ami trade m 
food and nonfooci items, the high < ivdi/ations 
of Mesopotamia, northern India, Egypt, and 
Rome would not have been possIblt^ 

Irrigation systems m China, Egypt, and the 
Near East were elaborated, putting more land 
into cultivation. Thc" forced labor of piHSmts 
and the bureaucracy built up to plan ami 
supervise the work of irrigaiton were probably 
basic m the development of the c ity^states of

OF 

Feudal Agriculture. The feudal period in Eu- 
rope began soon after the fall of the Roman 
Empire, reaching a height about 1100 ad This 
period was also that of the development of the 
Byzantine Empire (q v ) and of the power of the 
Saracens {q v ) m the Middle East and southern 
Europe, see Caliph Spam, Italy, and southern 
France, in particular, were affected by events 
outside continental Europe, see Moors, Norse- 
men 

In the Arab period in Egypt and Spain, irriga- 
tion was extended to previously sterile or un- 
productive land In Egypt, grain production was 
sufficient to allow the country to sell wheat in 
the international market In Spam, vineyards 
were planted on sloping land, and irrigation 
water was brought from the mountains to the 
plains In some Islamic areas, oranges, lemons, 
peaches, and apricots were cultivated 

Rice, sugarcane, cotton, and such vegetables 
as spinach and artichokes, as well as the charac- 
teristic Spanish flavoring saffron (q.v ), were 
produced. The silkworm and its food, the mul- 
berry tree, were grown; see StiK History 

By the 12th century agriculture in the Middle 
East was static, and Mesopotamia, for example, 
fell back to subsistence level when its irrigation 
systems were destroyed by the Mongols, see 
Mongol Dynasties The Crusades (q.v.) increased 
European contact with Islamic lands and famil- 
iarized western Europe with c itrus fruits and silk 
and cotton textiles, for a general description of 
life in Europe during the teucial period, see 
Feudalism, Middu Ac4S 

ft should be pointed out that the practice of 
agriculture was not uniform. In Scandinavia and 
eastern Germany, the small farms and villages of 
previous years remained. In mountainous areas 
and in the marshlands of Slavic Europe, the 
manorial system could not flourish. Stock raising 
and olive and grape culture were normally 
outside the system. 

A manor required some 900 to 2000 acres of 
arable land and the same amount of other 
prescribed lands — waste, woodlots, pasture, and 
so forth. Typically, the manor was a se^lf-con- 
tained community On it was the large home of 
the holder of the fief — a military or church 
vassal of rank — or of his steward A parish 
church was frequently included, and the manor 
might make up the entire parish. One or more 
villages might be located on the manor, and 


village peasants were the actual farmers Under 
the direction of an overseer, they produced the 
crops, raised the meat and draft animals, and 
paid taxes in services, either forced labor on the 
lord's lands and other properties or forced 
military service 

A large manor had a mill for grinding gram, an 
oven for baking bread, fishponds, orchards, 
perhaps a wine or oil press, and herb and 
vegetable gardens Bees were kept to produce 
honey 

Woolen garments were produced from sheep 
raised on the manor The wool was spun into 
yarn, woven into cloth, and then sewn into 
clothing Linen textiles could also be produced 
from flax grown for oil and fiber 

The food served in a feudal castle or manor 
house varied — depending on the season and 
the lord's hunting prowess Hunting for meat 
was, indeed, the major nonmilitary work of the 
lord and his military retainers The castle resi- 
dents could also eat domestic ducks, pheasants, 
pigeons, geese, hens, and partridges, fish, pork, 
beef, and mutton, cabbages, turnips, carrots, 
onions, beans, and peas Bread, cheese and 
butter, ale and wine, apples and pears also 
appeared on the table In the south, olives and 
olive oil might be used, often instead of butter 

Leather was produced from the manor's cat- 
tle Horses and oxen were the beasts of burden, 
as lighter plows were developed, the horse 
became more important A blacksmith, wheel- 
wright, and carpenter made and maintained 
agricultural implements 

The cultivation regime was rigidly prescribed. 
The arable land was divided into three fields 
one sown m the autumn in wheat or rye, a 
second sown in the spring in barley, rye, oats, 
beans, or peas, and the third left fallow The 
fields were laid out in strips distributed over the 
three fields, and without hedges or fences to 
separate one strip from another Each peasant 
was allotted about thirty strips Helped by his 
family and a yoke of oxen, he worked under the 
direction of the lord's officials When he 
worked on his own fields, he followed village 
custom that was probably as rigid as the rule of 
an overseer 

About the 8th century a four-year cycle of 
rotation of fallow appeared. The annual plowing 
routine on 400 acres would be 100 acres plowed 
in the autumn, 100 in the spring, and 200 acres 
of fallow plowed in June These three periods of 
plowing, over the year, would produce two 
crops on 200 acres. Typically, ten or more oxen 
were hitched to the tongue of the plow, often 
little more than a forked tree trunk with a

and dairy products. Independent manonaltsm 
was also affected by the wars of 14th- and 
15 th-century Europe and by the widespread 
plague (q v ) outbreaks of the late 14th century. 
Whole villages wore wiped out, and much 
arable land was abandoned The remaining 
peasants were discontented and attempted to 
improve their conditions, see Jacquerie, Peas- 
ants' War 

With the decline m the labor force, only the 
best land was kept m cultivation, and m south- 
ern Italy, for instance, irrigation helped to in- 
crease production on the more fertile soils The 
emphasis on gram was replaced by diversifica- 
tion, and crops requiring more care were pro- 
duced Among these were wine, oil, cheese, 
butter, and vegetables. 

For the transition period from feudalism to 
modern Europe, see Europe: History, Hundred 
Years' War; Reformation; Renaissance 
Scientific Agriculture. By the 16th century, 
population was increasing m Europe, and agri- 
cultural production was again expanding 

The nature of agriculture there and in other 
areas was to change considerably m succeeding 
centuries Several factors can be identified. 
Europe was cut off from Asia and the Middle 
East by an extension of Turkish power; see 
Turkey* History. New economic theories were 
being put into practice, directly affecting agri- 
culture. And continued wars, between England 
and France, within each of these countries, and 
m Germany consumcHi capital and manpower; 
see Engiand: History; France: History; Thirty 
YEARS' War 

A new period of exploration and colonization 
was undertaken to circumvent Turkey's control 
of the spice trade, to provide homes for reli- 
gious refugees, and to provide wealth for Euro- 
pean nations convinced that only precious met- 
als constituted wealth. See Coiony, Commerce; 
Exploration, Geographic, Imperiaiism, Mercantile 
System, The; Migration 

Colonial agriculture was earned out not only 
to feed the colonists, but to produce cash crops 
and to supply food for the home country. This 
meant cultivation of such crops as sugar, cotton, 
tobacco, and tea and production of animal 
products such as wool and hides. From the 15th 
century to the 19th century the slave trade 
provided needed laborers, replacing natives 
killed by unaccustomed hard labor in unfavor- 
able climates and substituting for imported 
Europeans on colonial plantations that required 
a larger labor force than the colony could 
provide. Negro slaves worked, for instance. In 
the Caribbean area on sugar plantations and in 


North America on indigo and cotton planta- 
tions. Indians were virtually enslaved in Mexico. 
Ultimately, however, both slavery and serfdom 
were substantially wiped out m the 19th cen- 
tury See Colonial Life in North America, Peon- 
age, Plantation, Slavery 

When encountered by the Spanish conquista- 
dors, the more advanced Indians in the New 
World had intensive agricultural economies but 
no draft or riding animals and no wheeled 
vehicles Squash, beans, peas, and corn had long 
since been domesticated Land was owned by 
clans and other kinship groups or by the "state", 
but not by individuals or individual families 
Several civilizations had risen and fallen in 
Central and South America by the 16th century 
Those met by the Spanish were the Aztec, Inca, 
and Maya (qq.v ) See also Mexico. History, Peru 
History 

The scientific revolution resulting from the 
Renaissance and the Age of Enlightenment in 
Europe encouraged experimentation in agricul- 
ture as well as in other fields; see Agricultural 
Education Enlightenment, Age of. Science Experi- 
ments m plant breeding produced improved 
crops, and new strains of cattle and sheep were 
developed by controlled "trial-and-error''' meth- 
ods Enclosure was greatly speeded up in the 
18th century, and individual landowners could 
determine the disposition of land and of pas- 
ture, previously subject to common use Crop 
rotation, involving alternation of legumes with 
gram, was more readily practiced outside the 
village strip system inherited from the manorial 
period. In England, where scientific farming was 
most efficient, enclosure brought about a fun- 
damental reorganization of land ownership 
From 1660 on, the large landowners had begun 
to add to their properties, frequently at the 
expense of small independent farmers. By Victo- 
rian times, the agricultural pattern was based on 
the relationship between the landowner, de- 
pendent on rents; the farmer, producer of crops; 
and the landless laborer, the "hired hand" of 
American farming lore. Drainage brought more 
land into cultivation, and, with the industrial 
revolution (q.v.), farm machinery was intro- 
duced. 

Early implements included an improved plow 
imported from the Low Countries into England 
and Scotland in the first half of the 18th century, 
and various types of threshing machines were 
developed in the second half. The seed drill of 
the English agriculturist Jethro Tull (1674-1741) 
about 1700 was a particularly notable develop- 
ment.

US. began in earnest m the I9ih century, Ihe 
steel plow of John Deere (1804-86), an Ameri- 
can blacksmith and manufacturer, was used to 
advantage in the prairies of the U S after the 
1830's Steam power was frequently used to 
replace animal power in drawing plows and in 
operating threshing machinery soon after the 
middle of the century 

The demand for food for urban residents anti 
raw materials for industrial plants produ<ed a 
realignment of world trade Science and tech 
nology developed for industrial purposes were 
earned over into agriculture, eventually result 
ing in the agribusinesses of the middle of the 
20th century 

The 17th and 18th centuries saw th<‘ first 
systematic attempts to study and control pests 
Before this time, handpicking and spraying wc^re 
the usual methods of pest control in the bHh 
century, poisons of various types were devel 
oped for use in sprays, and biological controls 
such as predatory insects were also uschT Resist 
ant plant varieties were cultivateci; this was 
particularly successful with the luropean grape 
vine, in which the grape bearing stc*ms 
grafted onto resistant American rootstocks to 
defeat the Phylloxera aphid, See Iniovkhcka

Improvements in transportation affecteni agri- 
culture, Food could be protec tcnil m transport 
and shipped more economically than before^ as 
a result of rad, ship, and refngemion develop 
ments of the late 19th and early 2dth centuri«*s 
Efficient use of these developmcmts led lo 
increasing specialization and eventual changes 
m the location of agric ultural suppliers. In the 
last quarter of the 19th century, for example, 
Australian and North American suppliers dis 
placed European suppliers of gram m the luro 
pean market. When gram prodmtion proved 
unprofitable, specialization in other areas--«dai 
rying, cheesemaking, and others—wcw ennpha 
sized; see World Agriculture, abiwe, 

The interrelationships between agric ullure 
and population have always been evident Ihe 
impetus toward more food production m the 
era following World War It was a result of a new 
population explosion. A so-called green revolu 
tion, the adaptation of traditional t rops, ernpha^ 
sizing high yields and intensive cultivation 
methods, to the climates and cultufal condmons 
of densely populated countries such as India, 
temporarily stemmed the pressure for more 
food. But a worldwide shortage of sources of 
energy (that is, coal and petroleum) m the 
mid"1970"s reduced the supplies of ferblizer 
necessary to the success of the new cyftivation

tion of refrigerated motor trucks, by rapid deliv- 
ery by airplane, and by the quick-freeze process 
ot preservation, m which farm produce is frozen 
and packaged the same day that it is picked 
Freeze-drymg and irradiation have also reached 
practical application for a variety of perishable 
foods 

Scientific methods have been increasingly 
applied to pest control by widespread use of 
insecticides and fungicides and quarantine of 
infected districts. New understanding of signifi- 
cant biological control measures has made pos- 
sible more effective control of certain kinds of 
insects 

Chemicals for weed control have become 
important for a number ot crops, in particular 
cotton and corn. The increasing use ot chemi- 
cals for the control of insects, diseases, and 
weeds has brought about careful enforcement 
of the pure food and drug laws dealing with 
food adulterants anci additives These regula- 
tions make strong demands on the skill of farm 
operators 

Price-Support Measures. One of the recurring 
problems of American agriculture in the 20th 
century has been the tendtmey of farm prices 
and income to lag behind increases m the 
general price level and in urban income. The 
problem began to manifest ilstHf m the 1920's, 
following a period of exceptional prosperity for 
U.S. farmers. During the years between 18% ancJ 
191 S, nonfarm production rose more rapidly 
than farm procJuction, and the demand for farm 
products was considerably increased by a high 
rate of population growth and by rising in- 
comes. As a consequence, prices paid for farm 
products rose faster than general prices. The 
period 19(B-14 was later taken as a standard for 
the level of farm pric es m relation to the general 
price level. After the outbreak of World War I 
the U.S. became the chief source of food for the 
warring nations of Europe, with U $. farmers 
bringing some 8C), OCX), ODD additional acres of 
land under cultivation and investing heavily in 
new equipment. These measures, however, did 
not really begin to raise production levels until 
1920, when both the domestic and the European 
demand for U $. farm products had declined. 

Farm mcome had scarcely begun to recover 
when the Great F)epression of the 19^'s exacer- 
bated the economic difficulties of the farmer. 
By 1952 the level of farm prices was only about 
65 percent of the 1909-14 average. Farmers 
continued to produce almost as much as before. 
Although prices for industrial goods declined, 
they did not drop as severely as farm prices, so 
that by 1932 4he ratio of prices received to 


prices paid by farmers reached an all-time low 
of 58 percent, that is, they were receiving only 
$0 58 from the sale of their products for every 
dollar that they had to pay for nonfarm items. 

The Federal government, which had done lit- 
tle m the 1920's to reduce the disparity between 
rural and urban incomes, initiated remedial pro- 
grams during the administration of President 
Franklin D Roosevelt (q v ) During this period 
the concept of parity came into use According 
to this concept, the prices farmers received for 
their commodities in the period 1909-14 bore a 
fair relationship to the prices they had to pay for 
goods they bought, and the period was there- 
fore taken as a standard In order to achieve sat- 
isfactory farm prices, the Administration de- 
cided to reduce the supply of basic farm 
commodities. The Agricultural Adjustment Act 
of 1933 provided payments to farmers in return 
for agreements to curtail their acreage or their 
production of certain basic commodities The 
Act was declared unconstitutional in 1936, but 
in 1938, after several changes in the membership 
of the Supreme Court of the United States, a 
second Agricultural Adjustment Act was passed 
under which production quotas were set as be- 
fore, The government agreed to buy crops at 
parity prices from participants in its program to 
limit production. The government also lent 
money to farmers to enable them to withhold 
crops from the market when prices were low 
and to store the produce so that it might be 
available in poor crop years. 

Until World War II the problem of low farm 
prices was not basically a result of overproduc- 
tion. Rather, it was a consequence of the cycles 
of business and weather, and of problems of in- 
ternal distribution, transportation, and credit. 
Following World War II, however, overproduc- 
tion became a serious problem Both during and 
immediately after the war, farm prices were 
generally high. Because production costs also 
were high, parity payments remained in force. 
Federal transactions in surplus commodities, 
principally the sale of such commodities at 
prices less than those paid to farmers, proved 
very costly for the government To reduce costs 
of the Federal farm program, the administration 
of President Dwight D. Eisenhower (q.v.) pro- 
posed the substitution of flexible or variable 
price supports for the rigid 90 percent of parity 
that was in force. A bill authorizing a sliding 
scale of payments at 82% percent to 90 percent 
of parity on the basic commodities was enacted 
by the United States Congress m 1954. 

The Agricultural Act of 1956, otherwise 
known as the soil-bank program, authorized 


281 



AGRICULTURE 


Federal payments to farmers if they reduced 
production of certain crops. A subsidy plan was 
formulated whereby farmers would be paid for 
converting part of their cropland to soil-con- 
serving uses. In practice, the farmers shared the 
costs of planting trees or grasses and received 
annual payments compensating them tor the 
economic loss incurred by the removal of some 
of their land from production 
The Department of Agriculture in the admin- 
istrations of Presidents )ohn F, Kennedy and 
Lyndon B. Johnson (qq.v) during the 1%C)\ 
made control of overproduction a primary goal 
of farm policy Farmers were offered what was 
in effect a rental payment tor a part of their lanci 
that would be taken out of production during 
the following year. At the same time, measures 
were undertaken to expand the export market 
for agricultural products. During this period the 
ratio of a farmer's per capita income to that at a 
non-farm person increased from about SO per- 
cent to about 75 percent 

Direct subsidies for withholding agricultural 
(and from production were phased out in 197 i, 
as a result of a proposal by President Richard M. 
Nixon (q.v.). In the same year, net agrtcultural 
income swelled to $33,4 billion.

AGRICULTURE 


introduced in the 1930's Connmercial wheat 
production is centered in the Great Plains and 
parts of the Pacific Northwest The growing sea- 
son and rainfall m these areas are more favor- 
able to wheat than to corn, and the topography 
allows the use of large agricultural machinery. 

Cotton, requiring a long, hot growing season, 
early became an important crop in the South 
Mechanical harvesting equipment and extensive 
irrigation have also enabled growers to cultivate 
cotton m the Southwest. 

Tobacco growing is highly specialized, with 
the leading States, North Carolina, Kentucky, 
and South Carolina, all growing distinctive 
types Some tobacco for cigar fillers, binders, 
and wrappers is grown in the North, often 
shaded by cheesecloth to conserve the moisture 
in the soil and air. This enables farmers to grow 
thm-leaved plants needed for cigar binders and 
wrappers The U S., exporting more than one 
fourth of its production, is the world's largest 
producer of tobaa o with over 19 percent of the 
world crop. 

Vegetable and dairy production tend to be 
concentrated near large cities Refrigeration and 
rapid transportation have resultc'd, however, m 
the devefopmcmt of large acreages of vegetables 
along the Gulf and Atlantic coasts and in the 
irrigateci valleys of the West, and of dairy re- 
gions m the northern parts of the North Central 
States 

Citrus fruits grow only in areas where the 
temperature seldom drops below freezing Ap- 
ple orchards do well in mountain vallc^ys, often 
on slopes too steep for other cultivation. In 
1964, 58 percent of the land planted with groves, 
fruit trc»es, nut trees, and vineyards was in Cali- 
fornia and floricia. Other leading States are 
Washington (apples and pears), Michigan (cher- 
ries), Texas (pec ans), Oregon (filberts), and Mas- 
sachusetts {< ranberries), 

live-stock raising is also spec iaiized (see Ani- 
mal Husbandry, below). The production of hogs 
has tended to be concentrated in the corn belt 
States of Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, and Nebraska. 
Beef cattle production, which requires feed 
corn but depends perhaps more on the avail- 
ability of good pasture, is concentrated in such 
States as Texas and Kansas as well as those of the 
corn belt. Sheep raising is carried on mainly in 
the mountains and drier ranges of the western 
States. 

Because poultry grows well tn confinement, 
there is no one area of specialization except for 
ducks, nearly all of which are grown in a rela- 
tively small area of long Island, New York. Oth- 
erwise, the leading poultry States are California, 


Georgia, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Arkan- 
sas, and Texas for eggs; Arkansas, Georgia, Ala- 
bama, North Carolina, Mississippi, and Mary- 
land for broilers, and California and Minnesota 
for turkeys 

Agricultural Economics. The total land area 
of the U S IS about 2 264 billion acres, of which 
about 47 percent is used for farming In the 
northern Plains States more than 95 percent of 
the land area is farmland, in the South 62 per- 
cent, in the West 45 percent, and in Alaska less 
than 1 percent. About 363,CXX),CXX) acres were 
under cultivation m the mid-1970's; this repre- 
sented a decrease from 387,000,000 acres at the 
beginning of the decade, despite large increases 
in production for export 
The history of agriculture in the U S since the 
depression has been one of consolidation and 
increasing efficiency From a high of 6,800,000 
farms in 1935, the total number of farms de- 
clined to 2,800,000 in the mid-1970's—but on 
virtually the same number of acres (1 06 billion 
acres in 1935, 1 09 billion acres in the 1970's) 
While the average size of a farm in 1935 was 155 
acres, today it is 393 acres 

U.S farm population in the mid-1970's was 
8,253,000, or 3 9 percent of the population One 
farmer could produce enough food to feed 56 
other people, as against 20 other people 20 years 
earlier. Continuing a long upward trend, farm 
output per man hour increased by more than 40 
percent from 1%7 to 1976 
About 61 5 percent of farms in the U S was 
fully owned by their operators in the 1970's, 27 1 
percent was partly owned and 11 3 percent was 
operated by tenants The percentages forty years 
earlier were about the same, except that in the 
1930's there were about three times as many ten- 
ant-operated farms. Outstanding farm debt in 
the mid-1970's was $101 8 billion, of which 
about 56 percent was owed on real estate Inter- 
est payments on the mortgage debt amounted 
to more than $4 billion per year. 

In the mid-1970's the total value of land and 
buildings on U.S. farms was about $308.9 billion, 
the value of products sold was about $80.6 bil- 
lion per year. Net farm income was over $20 bil- 
lion, up from about $12.9 billion ten years ear- 
lier. Average Income per farm at mid-decade 
was about $7200, up from $3800 m 1%5, 

Major non-real-estate expenditures by farm- 
ers were for feed ($13 9 billion), fertilizer ($6.2 
billion), seed ($2.3 billion), machinery and 
equipment ($4 9 billion), and hired farm labor 
(nearly $7 billion).

was organized in the US. Oepartment of Ago

replaced the Office of farm Management m 
1923. In conjunction with the agru ultural expc^c 
iment stations in the various States, the dispart 
ment has made numerous studu^s of systems ot 
farming as followed m different areas, Such 
studies naturally led to the development of 
cost-accounting techniques for agric uliural pro

Agriculture m the Unned States The dominant trend has been toward fewer but larger farms and greater use of 
farm marhmery; mec hani/ation has increased the farmer's productivity and shortened his workday.

agriculture 


herd average to date for a herd of more than 
thirty cows was achieved in 1%7 at Ih. 

per cow. A milk-production record for a single 
cow was set in 1974 by a Holstein that yielded 
50,759 lb. of milk during a 365-day lactation pe- 
riod. 

Persistency of milk production and reproduo 
tion of quality calves are key factors in dairy ' 
farm efficiency. Most dairy cows calve at two 
years of age and give birth to a calf every twelve 
to thirteen months thereafter. The female calves 
are valued as replacements for older cows; the 
male offspring of the highest producers may i)e 
kept as future herd sires, the others being sold 
to be slaughtered for veal. The productive life of 
dairy cows is six to seven years. 

The principal dairy breetis are Holsteins, usu • 
ally the heaviest milk producers; ferseys and 
Guernseys, which give milk containing a higher 
percentage of butterfat; and Brown Swiss. Most 
dairy stock now comes from ancestry largely 
purebred, at least on the paternal side. 
Beef-Cattle Husbandry. Production of lieef 
involves three distinct types of agricultural etv- 
terprise: breeding, ranching, and feeding, Some 
farmers engage in all three, but thc^ current trend 
is toward specialization. 

The farmer who grows purebred animats ex 
clusively depends primarily upon selling his 
output as breeding stock to rancht^rs and other 
growers who wish to improve their herds. 

Currently, value is based upon pertormance 
tests that measure growth efftcienry, reprodur 
tive ability, and other economic faclc^rs. Pyre^ 
breds having good records as intfividuab, lam- 
flies, and strains, and measuring up well or^ 
performance tests, are in steady demand. 
cows must calve cwery year for three years anti 
must produce sufficient milk to wean iheir 
calves in order that their value as caif pfodyi:efs 
can be measured. Their average reprociuctive 
life is eight to ten years. 

Commercial ranchers spcKdalize m growing 
calves for sale to professional feeders,. A 9d 
cent production rate of calves pc^r year is ctm^ 
sidered a good standard. Pasture availafoiliiy artd 
m;anagement are important, as is the abilily to 
choose outstanding offs.prmg to serve m 
placements in cow herds. 

Farmers who specialize in feeding buy the 
young animals when they are one year of age or 
less and weigh between 600 and '900 lb, in the 
U.S. the feeders are usually corn-bell farmers; 
however, iarge-scale feeding lots in other areas 
are becoming more common. The feeders may 
visit ranches to select their stock or obtain them 
from stockyards such as those at Omaha, Nebr.,

AGRICULTURE, DEPARTMENT OF, an exec- 
utive department of the Federal government of 
the United States, begun about 1836 as a branch 
of the OftKC of the Commissioner of Patents 
with the purpose of distributing plants and 
seeds to farmers It was established as a depart- 
ment of agrKulture by Congress in 1862 and 
raised to Cabinet level in 1889. The department 
carries out programs of research, education, 
conservation, forestry, marketing, credit, export 
expansion, food distribution, production adjust- 
ment, grading and inspection, and development 
of rural areas It is administered by a secretary 
appointed by the President with the approval of 
the Senate He is assisted by an undc^rsecretary, 
four assistant secretaries, a director of science 
anci education, and a director ot agricultural 
economics. 

About the tirnt* the department was raised to 
Cabinet level, the* reservc*s of public lands avail- 
able tor homesteading were becoming de- 
pleted. Instead of moving from worn-out land 
to tree or < hc*ap tc^rtik* lands, farmt‘rs had to 
turn to science to irn rcMse production and in- 
come* Consequently, from about 1890 on, the 
duties and responsibilities of the department 
grew rapidly, fxisting units of the organization 
were mergcnl, aneJ nc*w units wc*re created to 
carry on rc*search arxi service activitic^s and to 
administer regulatory laws. 

The growth and expansion of the D<*partmcmt 
of Agriculture (ontfnucni during the d(*pr(>ssion 
of the 19i0\ when th<‘ fjroblem of surplus farm 
products became (»xtreme!y acute; the depart* 
men! was rc*organizc*d sevt^ral timers. During 
World War It, many bureaus ot the* department 
were split off to form the War food Administra- 
tion, but these bureaus w<*n‘ returned to the 
untficKi control of the cie^partmemt in a reorgani- 
zation begun |ust after the* war, 

Some of the < urrent major units of the depart- 
ment are desc nbed bc»low The Agricultural Re- 
sc^arch Service (q,v,), in addition to maintaining 
research in farming, farm products, marketing, 
consumc*r and food economics, and human nu- 
trition, gives special attention to the use of safe 
pesticicies and development of low-cost pro- 
tein-rich foods to improve diets m developing 


countries With the continuing ability of farmers 
to produce more than the market demands, es- 
pecially in grains, the Agricultural Stabilization 
and Conservation Service carries out programs 
aimed at keeping gram production balanced 
with needs. The Marketing and Consumer Ser- 
vices administers school lunch, special miik, 
food stamps, and direct food distribution pro- 
grams, It also helps the Agricultural Marketing 
Service in assuring safe, efficient movement of 
products from producertoconsumerand the Ani- 
mal and Plant Health Inspection Service in safe- 
guarding the health and quality of animals and 
plants and m protecting the consumer by means 
of Federal-State meat and poultry inspection 
The Cooperative State Research Service 
administers Federal-grant funds for agricultural 
research by the States and participates m the 
coordination of major regional research proj- 
ects The Economic Research Service produces 
studies on agricultural prices, income, and food 
and fiber demand and supply The Foreign Agri- 
cultural Service works to develop markets 
abroad and expand agricultural exports. Under 
Its sponsorship, about 375 technicians of the de- 
partment work m some thirty-five developing 
nations to improve agriculture, and about 4000 
officials of developing nations annually receive 
agricultural training in the U S 

The Rural Community Development Service 
coordinates department activities aimed at fos- 
tering opportunity and economic growth in 
rural America The Soil Conservation Service has 
the function of helping to develop natural re- 
sources, control erosion and sedimentation, 
prevent floods, and plan community use of 
land Technical service is given each year to 
more than 1,000,000 persons in some 3000 soil- 
conservation districts and 1200 watershed proj- 
ects The Statistical Reporting Service gathers 
data on about 150 crop and livestock products 
and issues some 700 reports annually 
Other units of the Department of Agriculture 
are the Commodity Credit Corporation, the 
Farmers Home Administration, the Federal Ex- 
tension Service, the Forest Service, and the Rural 
Electrification Administration (qq v.) 
AGRIGENTO (lat Agngentum, Gr Akragas), 
city of Italy, on the island of Sicily, capital of 
Agngento Province, mi. n of Porto Empedocle 
on the Mediterranean Sea. The city is a tourist 
and an agricultural trading center; it processes 
sulfur and food and manufactures cement and 
furniture. The city has rums of twenty Greek 
temples, including the excejiently preserved 
Temple of Concord, the Temple of Hera Lacinia, 
the colossal Temple of the Olympian Jove, and 


287 



AGRIMONY 


the Temple of Heracles, all dating from the 5th 
and 6th centuries b.c. Agrigento is an episcopal 
see. 

Akragas was founded by Greeks from the city 
of Gela (q,v.), about 582 b.c and became an im^ 
portant trading and cultural center with a popu - 
lation of about 200,000. It was the birthplace of 
the Greek philosopher Empedocles (q.v.). After 
406 B.C., when it was sacked by a force from Car* 
thage (q.v,), Akragas declined in importance, ai« 
though it remained a large city throughout an* 
tiquity. In 262 b.c it was tncorporated into the 
Roman Empire and became known as Agri* 
gentum. It was called Girgenti from the early 
Middle Ages until 1928, when the name was 
changed officially to Agrigento. During World 
War li it was the scene of a great artillery battle; 
the town was taken by American troops on }uly 
16, 1943, Pop. (1971) 49,293. 

AGRIMONY, common name for hardy pereri'* 
nial herbs of the gertus Agrimonia In the Rose 
family (Rosaceae). Agrimonia has fifteen 
species, all native to northern temperate re 
gions. It has interruptedly pinnate leaves, with 
the leaflets serrate and downy beneath; the 
flowers are small and yellow, in close racemes, 
and the fruit is armed with hooked bristles. The 
plants grow to a height of about 2 to 3 ft. Com 
mon agrimony, A. eupatoria, is native to lurope, 
A. parviflora, a closely similar species disbO' 
guished by slightly smaller flowers, is found m 
temperate regions in the eastern United Stares. 
AGRIPPA, HEROD., See under 
AGRIPPA^ Marcus Vlpsanius (61-12 bc K 
Roman general and statesman. In 36 8C he de 
feated the Roman general Pompey (sw 
PEius: Sextus Pompeius Magnus) in the naval 
battles of Mylae (now Milazzo, Italy) and Naulo^ 
chus. This victory paved the way for Ot lavian, 
heir of Gaius Julius Caesar (q.v.), to bectrae the 
sole ruler of the Roman Impire, 

in 31 B.C Agrippa commanded Octavian's fleet 
in the victory at Aclium (see Aciium. BAftii or) 
over the combined forces of th«* Roman general 
Marcus Antonius and Cleopatra (qq.v.). Queen 
of Egypt. In 27 b.c., when Octavian b«H’am«.» the 
first Roman emperor, assuming the name Aif- 
gustus (q.v.), Agrippa is thought to have budi 
the Roman Pantheon (q.v.) in commemoratiort 
of the Battle of Actium. 

Much of the success of the reign of Augusius 
was due' to Agrippa. He was active in many cam« 
paigns and frequently served as provincial gov* 
ernor. He was one ol the em,peror"s most trusted 
advisors, and in 21 B.c married Julia .the 
only child of Augustus. By Jutii, Agrippa had 
three sorts and two daughters, one of whom,

AHVENANMAA (Sw., Aland), province of 
Finland, composed of a group of islands sit- 
uated at the N end of the Baltic Sea, at the 
mouth of the Gulf of Bothnia, between Sweden 
and f inland The group, known as the Aland 
Islands, consists of about 6500 granite islands 
and rocky reefs, of which approximately 80 are 
inhabited. Mariehamn, the aciministrative cen- 
ter and chief port, is located on Aland, the larg- 
est island, which is linked by daily ferry and 
steamship service to the Swedish and Finnish 
mainlands, and by air service from Mariehamn 
airport. Fishing, shipping, and tourism are the 
chief industries of the islands. Farming is con- 
fined to the cultivation of grams and vegetables, 
and to cattle raising and dairy products. The 
population, which Is entirely Swedish-speaking, 
IS gradually emigrating to Swc»den, 

The Ahvenanmaa, inhabited since prehistoric 
times, were Christianized by Sweden m the 12th 
century, and were ceded to Russia »n 1809. The 
positron of the islands made them of strategic 
importance during the Crimean War (q.v.), after 
which they were demilitarized. At the end of 


World War I, Finland granted the islands auton- 
omy to quiet a strong, pro-Swedtsh secessionist 
movement. Finnish sovereignty over the islands 
was confirmed by a 1921 decision of the League 
of Nations (q v ) Under pressure from the So- 
viet Union in 1951, the Finnish parliament re- 
nounced the autonomy guaranteed by the ear- 
lier decision, but granted the islanders special 
rights, including their own flag Area about 572

AIKEN, Conrad Potter (1889-1973), American 
poet and novelist, born in Savannah, Ga, and 
educated at Harvard University. His first volume 
of verse, Earth Triumphant and Other TaJes in 
Verse (1914), although derivative in style, reveals 
his talent for sensuous imagery and flowing 
rhythms. His Selected Poems won the 1930 Pu- 
litzer Prize in poetry and his Collected Poems 
won the 1954 National Book Award Later vol- 
umes of his poetry include Cats and Bats and 
Things with Wings (1965), Preludes (1966), Se- 
lected Poems (1969), and Thee (1971) 

Aiken is also the author of numerous novels 
and short stories, in many of which he uses 
psychoanalysis as a source of inspiration and 
sometimes of narrative technique. His Collected 
Novels appeared in 1964. Three Novels (1%5) 
includes Blue Voyage (1927), Great Circle (1933), 
and King Coffin (1935) The Short Stones of 
Conrad Aiken appeared m 1950 and his Col' 
tected Criticism in 1968 In recognition of his lit-

try of the Library of Congress from 1950 to 1952 
and was awarded the Cold Medal for Poetry by 
the National Institute of Arts and Letters in 1958

similation of most Ajnu groups by the Japanese 

The Amu social organization is based upon 
patrilineal km groups, each headed by a chief 
Local groups usually consist of five to ten 
households Spawning grounds of dog salmon 
are owned collectively; cooperative activities 
within these local groups include housebuilding 
and a ceremony involving the dog salmon Pit- 
houses, ground-stone celts, ground-bone pro- 
jectile points, and grit-tempered, cord-marked 
pottery have been uncovered by archeologists, 

Amu men are hunters and fishermen; the 
women gather food and also do some fishing 
Ainu agriculture, essentially primitive until re- 
cently, was engaged in mainly by women, who 
practiced a method of crop rotation The people 
have a basic diet ot cherry salmon, dog salmon, 
deer, bear, and at least nine plants. Tattooing of 
the face and arms is common among the 
women, and both men and women frequently 
wear earrings Adult males never shave The tra- 
ditional religion, predicated upon faith in a su- 
preme deity, IS a form ot nature worship that re- 
volves around a belief m spirits associated with 
natural phenomcma and forces, A bear cult is 
especially prominent, an annual religious festi- 
val IS climaxed by the sacrifice ot a bear about 
three years old, which, has been reared from 
cubhood 

Some contemporary anthropologists contend 
that a pure Ainu culture no longer exists, having 
been absorbed by that of the Japantw. E.I.K

AIR BRAKL See Brams, 

AIR, COMPRESSED- See Compressed Air. 

AIR COMPRESSOR, or AIR PUMP, machine 
that decreases the volume and increases the 
pressure of a quantity of air by mechanical 
means. Air thus < ompressed possesses great po- 
tential forte, because when external pressure is 
removed, the air expands rapidly. The con- 
trolled expansive force of compre^ssed air is 
used m many ways and provides the motive 
force for air motors and tools, including pneu- 
matic hammers, air drills, sandblasting ma- 
chines, and paint sprayers. 

Air < ompressors are of two general types: re- 
ciprocating and rotating In a rcniprocating, or 
displacement, compressor (see Fig 1), which is 
used to produce high pressures, the air is com- 
pressed by the action of a piston in a cylinder. 
On the upstroke of the piston, air flows into the 
cylinder through the intake valve; on the down- 
stroke of the piston the air is compressed and 
forced through an output-control valve into a 
reservoir or storage tank. 




A rotating air compressor (see Fig, 2), used for 
low and medium pressures, usually consists of a 
bladed wheel or fan which spins inside a closed 
circular housing Air is drawn in at the center of 
the wheel and accelerated by the centrifugal 
force of the spinning wheel or fan The energy 
of the moving air is then converted to pressure 
in the diffuser, and the compressed air is forced 
out through a narrow passage to the storage 
tank. 

As air IS compressed it is also heated Air mol- 
ecules tend to collide more often with each 
other in a smaller space, and the energy pro- 
duced by these collisions is evident as heat This 
heat IS undesirable in the compression process, 
so the air may be cooled on the way to the res- 
ervoir by circulating air or water For high-pres- 
sure compressed air, several stages of compres- 
sion may be employed, with the air being 
further compressed in each cylinder and cooled 
before each stage.

AIRCRAFT CARRIER, nav al vessel with a long, 
unobstructed flight deck from which aircratt 
can take off and land. A hangar deck immedi-

AIR-CUSHION VEHICLE, or GROUND-EF- 
FECT MACHINE or HOVERCRAFT, craft that op- 
erates above the surface of water or land while 
supported on a cushion of air 4 to 8 ft thick 
The air cushion is provided by a large fan that 
pushes air downward within a flexible skirt at- 
tached to the outer perimeter of the vehicle 
The skirt makes the vehicle appear to be operat- 
ing only a few inches above the surface The ve- 
hicle is moved forward either by propellers 
mounted above the vehicle or by control of the 
air exhaust through small openings around the 
skirt. Braking action is controlled by reversing 
the pitc h of the propeller or by c hanging the di- 
rection of air flow through the skirt vents 

Operating controls are essentially like those 
found m an airplane. A control wheel adjusts 
the pitch of the vehic le, and rudder pedals con- 
trol yaw. The speed over water is limited by 
wave height and wind sf^eed, Operation of the 
vehicle is much the same when moving from 
water to land, or vice versa, the air cushion pre- 
vents the hull from striking the ground when 
the terrain chang^s. 

Some air-cushion vehicles, such as the Bertin 
Hovertruck, have conventional wheel systems 
for travel over highways and solid ground, but 
for movement over marshland a built-in air- 
cushton systc^m supports three fourths of the 
weight of the truck. Most air-cushion vehicles, 
however, are true ground-effect machines, de- 
signed for amphibious operation over water, 
marshy ground, and beaches. 

An experimental air-cushion vehicle, de- 
signed to run on a track similar to a monorail, 
reached a speed of 215 m.p.h. on the 4 2-mi 
concrete test track in Gometz-la-Ville, France. 
The so-called aerotrain rode on a cushion of air 
% m. thick. 

The vehicles have both commercial and mili- 
tary applications, and a number of fifteen- to 
thirty-passenger craft have been placed in oper- 
ation around the world. One of the largest air- 
cushion vehicles currently in use is the 165-ton 
British SRN 4 hovercraft, Mountbatten, which 
began service in July, 1968. Designed for ferry 
and passenger service across the English Chan- 
nel, the craft can carry 30 automobiles and 250 
passengers. See also HvoROFOit

AIRMAIL 


ularly called hijacking (q v ), since 1968, how- 
ever, brought pressure on the U S government 
to ratify the treaty, and m May, 1969, the U S. 
Senate voted its consent to ratification. 
National Law. All countries have arr legisla- 
tion designed to conform to the international 
rules, so that their aircraft do not generally ex- 
perience problems in complying with the laws 
of the countries they fly over 

in the U S , domestic air law is embodied in 
the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 and the result- 
ing Federal aviation regulations. The CAB is 
also responsible for economic regulations gov- 
erning interstate air traffic States have local 
rules relating to intrastate aviation activities. 

Aircraft noise was the subject of a law en- 
acted by the U.S m 1968, giving the administra- 
tor of the Federal Aviation Administration (qv) 
the authority to set noise limitations for new air- 
craft and to order noise-reducmg equipment for 
existing aircraft 
See a/s'o Airplan? 

Space Law. The flights of unmanned and 
manned space vehicles that began in 1957 high- 
lighted the necessity for some legal recognition 
of spacecraft and activities in space. The U.N 
appointed a Commitc^c* for P('ac('ful Uses of 
Outer Space* in 1959, and its l<*gal subcommittee 
produced the Outc*r Space TrcuUy of lanuary, 

1967 T his treaty < odtf ied a< < epU'd prtne iples of 
international law relating to outer space and es- 
tablished the proposition that outer space is not 
subject to national appropriation and is to be 
used only for peaceful purposc*s. A treaty of 

1968 dcMit with the Rescue anci Return of Astro- 


nauts and Return of Objects Launched into 
Outer Space This treaty provides for the safe 
and prompt return to the launching state of any 
personnel of a spacecraft, any space object, or 
any component part that lands in the territory of 
another contracting state as a result of accident 
or other emergency 

In 1971 the U N enacted a space liability 
treaty providing that the launching country 
would be absolutely liable to pay compensation 
for loss of life, injury, or damage to property re- 
sulting from objects launched into space by that 
country See Astronautics; Communications Sat-

AIRMAIL, postal matter transported in aircraft 
over part of its trip, or the system for so trans- 
porting postal matter The first airmail service 
consisted of a few irregular trips early in 1911 
between two English cities within a few miles of 
London The first authorized United States air- 
mail was flown between Garden City and Ja- 
maica, N Y., in September, 1911. Regular airmail 
service from London to Pans was begun m 1919 
and air parcel post over the same route in 1922 
In the U S the first regular airmail route was es- 
tablished between New York City and Washing- 
ton, DC., in 1918 Transcontinental service, be- 
tween New York City and San Francisco, began 
m 1921; the scheduled flying time varied from

twenty-nine to thirty-three hours, but the 
planes flew only during the daytime. Day-ancL 
night service over the same route was estab- 
lished in 1924. Regular, scheduled, transoceanic 
airmail was inaugurated in 1935 w^ith service be- 
tween the U.S. and the Philippines. Before 19.35 
the Graf Zeppelin (see AiRsrtiP) had carried some 
mail across the North Atlantic Ocean, and there 
had been airmail flights across the South Atlan- 
tic from Africa to Brazil, but regular airmail 
flights across the North Atlantic between l:y 
rope and the U.S. did not begin until 1939. 

In the meantime international airmail ar 
rangements had been made: some provisions 
were included in the agreements reached at the 
International Postal Convention held in Madrid 
in 1920. A special (nternationai Air Mail Confer 
ence was held in 1927 at which it was agreini 
that a uniform cost woulrl l)e established to 
enable each country's airmail servict* to carry 
airmail of countries with similar service, lack of 
agreement concerning the right of tite aircraft 
of one country to fly over the land of another 
has not affected the amicable workings of the 
airmail accords. 

In 1935 there were about mi. of regular 

airmail routes in the U.S. (eKCluding service 
within Alaska), over which approximately 3,4t¥), 
000 ton-miles of mail wt^re flown, at an average 
cost to the U.S. Post Office Deparimeni fit 
per ton-mile. In 1945 there were mon* than 
56, BOO mi. of regular domestic routes jexclutling 
Alaskan service), over which approximately 
61,500,000 ton^mifes were flown at an average 
cost of 57.3 c€*nts per ton-mile. By imm* 
than 304, 000, (XX) ton-miks of mail were flown 

In 1952 the Post Office Deparimeni expen 
mented with shipping a limrUnl arnouni of first 
class mail by air between New York Ctly and 
Chicago and between Chicago and Washington, 
D.C This service was later expanded, acrorclmg 
to the amount of unused cargo spare available 
on regular airlines, and in 1975 the Postal Service 
merged domestic airmail with firsCiUss mad. In 
1977 afl categories of domestic air««*ligible mad 
transported amounted to 71 $,631 ,92 3 ton^mdei 
at an average cost of 29.5 cents pm ion*

and du( tod tans are also used for direct lift, but 
they tend to introduce drag into the horizontal 
flight Convertiplanes, ('oryd)ining the rotating

The S. 1.0,1. (short takiHitf anci landing) cratt 
IS an airplane that takes off and lands very 
steeply, thus rcHtuiring little runway. For a given 
payload, it is much more efficient m terms of 
fuel consumption anci power rc^quirements than 
a VJ.Ol. craft, it is also capable of higher 
speeds and longer- range* flights than a helicop- 
ter, For lighterdhan-air cTalt,.s<*c* Airship; Bahoon 

The t(*rm "'airplane'' genc*rally denotes the 
landplanc*, but it applit*s also to several other 
categories of aircraft, including the carrier- 
basc*(J plane*, the seaplane*, and the amphibian. 
The principal variation in structure is to be 
found in the* landing apparatus. I he earner- 
basc*d plane*, a type* of iandplane designed for 
use on an aircraft carrier (q.v,), is fitted with a 
tail hook that t*ngages a cable stretched across 
the dc*ck to arrest the plane after landing. The 
seaplane employs pontoons instead of the 
wheel gear of the* landplane In the variety of 
seaplane known as the flying boat, the fuselage 
is constructed as a hull, similar to that of a 
seagoing vessel, and serves to keep the plane 
buoyant. The amphibian is equipped with both 
wheel gear and hull or pontoons to permit oper- 
ation on land and water. 

Prior to World War II flying boats were used

for military transports and for intercontinental 
commercial service These planes were limited 
to low flying speeds, and to low landing speeds 
in water With the advent of planes that fly and 
land much faster, large planes have been limited 
to land-based operation. The amphibian, even 
slower because of its double undercarriage, is 
less commonly employed than the landplane 
For light sportplanes, amphibious floats have re- 
cently been made available Generally resem- 
bling conventional pontoons, they have a re- 
cessed wheel located at the center of balance of 
the seaplane, the wheel-well is waterproof. The 
wheel tire does not extend far enough to add 
much cJrag to the float in the water, but it is of 
sufficient diameter and protrudes far enough to 
enable wheeled landings to be made on hard- 
surfaced runways or short-cut grass 
Frindples of Flight For an airplane in level 
flight, two sets of opposing forces must be bal- 
anced The gravity force, which results from the 
weight of the plane, must be balanced by the 
lift that IS developed primarily by the wings and, 
to a smaller extent, by the fuselage. The drag, 
which is the resistance of the air to the forward 
motion of the plane must be overcome by the 
thrust produced by the propellers or by jet en- 
gines. For takeoff and climbing the lift must ex- 
ceed the weight; for acceleration the thrust 
must exceed the drag.

Lift is produced by the uonuniform prissure

quence of Bernoulli's principle (<|.v4, will have 
a lower pressure on the lop surfaci* than on the 
bottom surface, for a plane flying ai a givei>

relative to the oncoming air, the lift incfeases 
approximately as the square of the flight veior - 
ity as long as the flight spt‘<*d is well Ixdow ihi* 
speed of sound (approximately 7M) m.p.h, ai sea 
level). The lift also varies af>pfoximately linearly 
with the angle of attat k. Becaust^ the fill must

angle of attack must be in< reas<Ki as the sf>i*ed 
is reduced and at the low landing or lake oh 
speeds, the lift will havt* to be augmented bv

For optimum flight conditions the drag 
should be minimized, and the lift should be at a 
maximum. A well-designed airfoil with a high 
fift-to-drag ratio has a thm teardrop shaped seo 
tion with a maxim^um thickness-to-rhord ratio 
of from 6 to 15 percent and with maximum 
thickness of the airfoil occyrrmg between 
and 40 percent of the length of the chord from 
the leading edge. In addition, the airfoil rs nor^-^ 
mafly slightly cambered; a c'entral skeletal mean 
line through the airfoil will have a slight upward 
bulge.

als must be tar more resistant to heat than the 
aluminum ailoys used tor subsonic aircraft Tita- 
nium (q V ) IS an example of the type of heat- 
resistant, high-strength metal required in super- 
sonic aircraft The demands ot the supersonic 
age tor higher speeds, higher altitudes, and 
longer ranges have led not only to new aerody- 
namic designs, but also to research for new 
structural materials See also Development, 
below 

Airplane Structure. The present-day conven- 
tional airplane may be divided into tour compo- 
nents fuselage, wings, tail assembly, and land- 
ing gear, or undercarriage To these may be 
added the propulsion and control components, 
see Flight Control and Propulsion, below 
FustiAC.f in the early days ot aviation, the fu- 
selage was merely an open structural mount to 
support the <gher components of the plane, and 
the bottom ot the airframe served as the landing 
gear Subsc^quently, the need for greater 
strength and better performance resulted m the 
developmtmt of enclosed, boxlike, ''strut-and- 
wire" fuselages that not only increased lift and 
decreaseci drag but also providtKl protection for 
pilot and f)assenger, as wc‘ll as space tor c'argo. 
This type of strut turc^ known as truss, was grad- 
ually supersedc'd by the* morux oque (literally 
'Single* shi*ll") tusi‘fagt* I he loads imposed on 
such a structure art* carrt(*ci primarily by the 
skm, ratht»r than by the* internal framework, as m 
the trussed strut ture. In varying stages of ad- 
vam(*d design, it is the* most common fuselage 
presently in use*. 

WiNCiS Although the single-winged plane, 
known as the monoplane, macie its appearance 
m the first denade of powered flight, early air- 
plane construe tion favortnl the use* of two wings 
(the biplane), and occasionally even three or 
lour. Multiple-wing planes have the advantage 
ot superior lift, but the* monoplane was subject 
to lc*ss drag. Once* the* cantilever (q.v,) principle 
of wing construction was dev«*loped, the domi- 
nance of the monoplane* was assured, although 
It did rwt become* the* <J<*sign of < hoice until the 
Cantilcwer wings obtain their entire 
strength from structural elements inside the 
skm. In present-clay airc raft, cantilever construe - 
Iron IS employed in large aircraft, and external 
bracing is used only for small, light planes. 

The structure c?f a typical wmg consists of a 
spar-and»nb framework enc losed by a thm cov- 
ering of metal sheet, of treated fabric, or, infre- 
quently, of bonded plywood or of resin-impreg- 
nated glass fiber. The spar, or beam, extends 
from the fuselage to the wing tip. One or more 
spars may be used in the wmg, but the single 


spar IS the preferred design The ribs, at right an- 
gles to the spar, give the wmg its external shape 
If the covering is of metal sheet, it contributes 
Its own share of strength to the wmg This 
"stressed skm" type of wing is currently used m 
all large planes, fabric covering is employed for 
the wings of some small craft 
The size and shape of wings vary widely, de- 
pending on specific aerodynamic considera- 
tions. Wings of many supersonic planes have a 
high degree of sweepback (arrowhead tapering 
from the nose of the plane) and are as thm as 
possible, with a knifelike leading edge Such 
streamlining helps to reduce the compressibility 
shock when the plane approaches the speed of 
sound That the wmg is the most important 
structural member of the airplane is dramatically 
demonstrated by the development of the so- 
called flying wmg, a craft m which fuselage and 
tail are almost entirely eliminated. For speeds 
beyond the sound barrier, the nontapered wing 
IS often the most efficient 
Taii Assembly The conventional type of tad as- 
sembly consists of two basic surfaces, horizontal 
and vertical, each of which has movable sec- 
tions contributing to control of the craft and 
fixed sections to provide stability The leading 
section of the horizontal surface is known as the 
horizontal stabdizer, and the rear movable sec- 
tion, as the elevator. The stationary section of 
the vertical surface is called the fm, and the 
movable section, the rudder Two vertical sur- 
faces are used m some aircraft; in that case a 
double rudder is used. The V-shaped tail com- 
bines the rudder and elevator functions in a sin- 
gle device Tails vary m size according to the 
type of aircraft, but in supersonic flight the tail 
should be as small as possible, and its complete 
elimination would be the ideal design 
Landing Gear Present-day landing gear is one 
of the most intricate of all aeronautical mecha- 
nisms, Its components include the oleo strut, a 
hydraulic arm connecting the wheel with the 
wing or fuselage, absorbing the shock of land- 
ing; the retracting mechanism, which raises and 
lowers the gear, the wheels, and the wheel 
brakes. A number of types of undercarriage are 
known, but two are most commonly employed 
the conventional two-wheel gear and the tri- 
cycle gear. The former consists of two large 
wheels located forward of the center of gravity 
of the plane with a small wheel at the tail. A tri- 
cycle gear consists of two large wheels behind 
the center of gravity and a third wheel, called 
the nosewheel, in front of the two main wheels, 
landing is easier with the tricycle gear because 
braking and maneuvering are improved and the 


301 



AIRPLANE 


danger of nosing over is diminished. Other 
forms of landing gear include a caterpillar tread 
for handling heavy loads on poor landing fields, 
a swiveling gear for landing in crosswinds, and 
a combination skt- wheel gear for use on ice and 
snow. 

Flight Control. The attitude of an airplane is 
determined by three control devices, each ol 
which provides for movement about a ditterent 
axis. The three include the movable sections of 
the tail, which are the elevators and rudders; 
and the movable sections of the trailing (aft) 
edge of the wing, known as ailerons. The con 
trol surfaces are operated from the cockpit by 
means of a control stick and rudder pedals or by 
a wheel on a column and rudcier pedals. Slick 
control is used in smaller, lighter airplanes, and 
the wheel, with its greater leverage, is used in 
larger airplanes. 

Elevators provide for pitching movement 
around the lateral axis. A backward pull on the 
control stick or wheel column raises the eleva 
tors, thereby depressing the tail at>d idling the 
nose of the plane for a climt). forward move 
ment of the stick or column fjrtnitK tw the oppo 
site effect, making the plane dive. 

Ailerons, usually placed far out on the wing 
control rolling movemtmi around the longitydc 
nal axis, leftward movement t>t the stick or turn 
of the wheel raises the left aileron and lowers 
the right, thereby banking the plane to the led 
The reverse tilt occurs when fhe stick is pushed 
or the wheel turned to tlH» right 

Rudders provide for turning movement 
around fhe vertical axis, changing ihe course <it 
the plane to the left or the right VAherr the right 
rudder pedal is pressed, the rydiiiv lyrns ihr* 
plane to the right arounri the vertii at axis Press 
ing the left pedal produtes a left turn 

To insure easier anti more ilefHmdable han- 
dling of all control surfaces, a number of vet 
ondary controls have been devwetl lorn lalw 
are used or> rudders, ehwauirs, and arh*rcins ss a 
means of adjusting the equilibrium, or tom, of 
the plane. Other controls mt lude flaps {on iraii 
Ing edges) and slots {on leading edges} m in- 
crease lift for takeoff or drag for landing, or to 
improve various other Ihghi charartefistics- 
Spoilers are surfaces that normally lie flush wnh 
the wing but can b<? raised to present a flat sui ■■ 
face to the airstr-eam and thi* hfi of the 

wing. Somewhat similar surfat'es are tailed air 
brakes and extend at right angles to fhe fyselage 
or undersurface of the wmg to slow the spi*f*d 
of the plane.

gine In the reciprocating engine, heat energy is 
utilized to move pistons operating within cylin- 
ders Cylinder arrangement is generally in-line, 
horizontal-opposed, or radial, and either air- 
cooling or itquid-cooling systems are used 
Nearly all aircraft reciprocating engines are gas- 
oline operated In general, the advantages of the 
reciprocating engine are reliability and fuel 
economy 

The compound engine consists of a recipro- 
cating engine combined with an exhaust-gas 
turbine (q.v ) that drives a super-charger The 
chief advantage of the compound engine over 
the reciprocating engine is its high-power ca- 
pacity at high altitudes The compound engine 
served as the chief engine in U S military air- 
craft during World War II, before the advent ot 
jet propulsion, 

Nonrec iprcK atmg aircraft engines, all of 
whi< h operate on the principle^ of jet propulsion 
include the turbojet, the turboprop, the ramjet, 
and thi* r(sck<'t engine, Iht* turf)oprop, turbojet, 
and turbotan engines, which are a modific^ation 
of the turbojet engines, are gas turbines (q.v.), 
where air is first cornpresstHi in a compressor. 
lue\ IS then adcicnl to burn the oxygen in the air, 
mtreasing the gas temperature* and its volume. 
The high pressure gas(*s are thtm fiartially ex- 
pantJed through a turbine which drives the 
comprc*ssor {and the propellc*r in a turboprop 
engine). The* residual gas, that ts now at an in- 
termediate pressure is accc*ferate<f by expansion 
through a rearwarci facing nozzle, to produce a 
high leaving velocity and, with it, the desired 
thrust, Turboprop engines are efficient for me- 
dium-sized planes at spetnis up to about ^00 to 
4CX) rn.p.h. At higher spc*eds, turbojet or turbo- 
fan engines give better performance At speeds 
above* about SCX) rn.p.h, the performance of a 
propeller becomes so inefficient that propellers 
arc^ discarded as propulsicm devices in favor of 
jet engines. 

The ramjet engine is an mternal-combustion 
engine, to which the air compression needed 
for combustion is obtained from the speed of 
forward motion alone. As m the turbojet, its 
total power output is delivered as the jet thrust 
of its expelled gases. Although the ramjet can be 
applied to piloted aircraft, its present rate of 
fuel consumption is so prohibitively high that it 
is used only in guided-missile applications; see 
CuiDfD MiSSllB 

Like the ramjcH, the rocket engine has its 
chief application in guided missiles. In aircraft 
it is used primarily for jet -assisted take-off 


(JATO), as supplementary initial power. How- 
ever, rocket engines for piloted aircraft are in 
the developmental stage and have appeared m 
several experimental models See Rocket 
Noise Pollution A major problem confronting 
the designers of supersonic aircraft is that of 
noise Engine noise of supersonic transports is 
louder and more high-pitched than that of 
subsonic jets, already a serious annoyance to 
airfield workers and residents of communities 
near airports Medical concern, moreover, has 
been expressed about the effect of sonic 
booms, which are produced each time a super- 
sonic plane exceeds the speed of sound As an 
aircraft flies, the air rushing toward the plane 
should be deflected smoothly about the wing 
and in subsonic flight this does take place As 
supersonic speeds are reached, however, the 
airflow can no longer adjust itself well ahead of 
the wing since disturbance signals "Earning'" 
the air cannot move faster than the speed of 
sound As a result, the air has to adjust itself 
suddenly in the proximity of the leading edge of 
the wing by a sudden pressure rise or shock 
coupled with a redirection of the flow The 
resulting shock front which travels with the 
aircraft extends over large vertical distances and 
reaches the ground with an impact which 
sounds like an explosion even if a plane flies at 
maximum altitudes The shock wave may be so 
severe that it can break windows on the ground 
far beneath the plane Attempts were being 
made m the middle 1970's by designers, manu- 
facturers and investigators of various govern- 
ment agencies, including the Federal Aviation 
Administration (q.v.) to curb both engine noise 
and sonic booms. 

Airplane Types and Uses. Airplanes may be 
categorized according to their function and 
field of operation into three mam types (1) 
commercial aircraft, including those for trans- 
portation of passengers and cargo by scheduled 
and nonscheduied air lines, (2) military aircraft, 
and (3) utility or general aircraft, which include 
all types of airplanes not included in the other 
two. The particular characteristics of each plane 
are determined by the nature of the services to 
be performed. Increasing specialization in usage 
has resulted in wide variation in design require- 
ments 

Commercial Airplanes Although the airplane was 
adopted for passenger-transport service in Eu- 
rope by 1919, It was not fully accepted as a com- 
mon carrier in the U.$. until some years later, 
the carriage of mail by the U.S. Post Office De- 
partment, however, laid the foundation in the 
years from 1918 to 1927 for domestic airline

AIRPLANE 


service The typical passenger aircraft evolved 
from two-engme propeller planes such as the 
DC-3, which carried 21 passengers and cruised 
at 190 m.p h., to the powerful four-engine 
planes of the 1950's, which could carry up to 100 
passengers at speeds of over 300 m p h. By the 
mid-1970% U,S airlines were carrying about 
246,000,000 passengers per year on domestic and 
international routes 

Different types of passenger planes are used 
depending on two factors, the volume of traffic 
and the distance between airports The distance 
between airports is known as the stage length. 
The greatest number and variety of planes can 
operate profitably over stage lengths between 
250 and 1000 mi 

Commercial passenger jets were first used on 
long-distance runs; the British DeHavilland 
Comet began service m 1952, and the Boeing 
707 in 1958. Also developed in the late 1950's 
were the DC-8 and the Convair 880 and 990. 
These planes cruised at about 550 m.p.h. and 
carried over 100 passengers. 

Smaller jets such as the French Caravelle and 
the Boeing 727, both of which used a design 
with engines in the tail, were built for medium- 
distance runs of from .500 to 1500 mi In the mid- 
1960'$, even smaller rwo-engine jets were built 
to operate on short runs. These include the 
Boeing 737, the DC-9, and the Fokker F-28 

The Boeing 747, which made its first flight in 
1970, was the first of the wide-bodied planes 
that now serve on high-densrty medium and 
long-distance runs. The 747 employs four turbo- 
fan engines that develop 45,000 lb. of thrust 
apiece, and flies at over 550 m.p.h. It usually is 
fitted for 385 passengers, but can accommodate 
500 seated 10-abreast. 

The DC-10 and the Lockheed 1011 "Tristar" 
are each capable of carrying more than 300 pas- 
sengers. Both use a three-engines-aft design; 
they were built for Chicago-los Angeles flights 
and comparable stage lengths. The DC-10 first 
flew in 1971, and the L-1011 in 1972. 

The most technofogicaify advanced passenger 
aircraft is the supersonic transport or SST, a 
plane capable of flying back and forth across the 
North Atlantic m less time than it takes an ordi- 
nary jet to fly across one way. The Soviet TU-144 
was the first of these planes to be put in service 
It began making scheduled freight hauls within 
the Soviet Union in 1975. 

The British and French governments signed an 
agreement in 1962 to build the supersonic Con- 
corde; the first test model flew in 1971. A certifi- 
cate of airworthiness was granted in 1975, and 
the first commercial flights were made on jan. 


21, 1976 The French plane flew between Pans, 
Dakar, and Rio de Janeiro, and the British from 
London to Bahrain 

From Its inception the SST had been criticized 
for being uneconomical and excessively noisy 
Despite such objections, service to the U S was 
commenced on May 24, 1976, with simulta- 
neous flights from London and Pans to Dulles 
International Airport near Washington, D C. But 
the Port Authority of New York refused to allow 
the Concorde to land at Kennedy International 
Airport, pending evaluation of the plane's per- 
formance at Dulles International Airport It was 
only after the British and French won a lengthy 
battle m the courts that the plane began service 
to New York on Nov 22, 1977. 

The future of the SST was still not assured by 
the late 1970's Operating losses on the Con- 
corde were m excess of $1 billion, and produc- 
tion of the plane was scheduled to stop m 1978 
The French plane had extended service to Cara- 
cas, Venezuela, from Pans, but other new routes 
were still in the negotiating stage 

The air-freight business has enjoyed an un- 
precedented boom since World War II. Leading 
commercial cargo planes include the Canadair 
CL-44 and the A-W Argosy, in addition to spe- 
cially modified versions of the larger passenger 
jets. 

Military Airplanes. Military planes of the U S 
may be divided into four categories combat, 
cargo, training, and observation planes. Combat 
planes comprise fighters and bombers for land, 
sea, and carrier operations. 

The F-4 Phantom aircraft, used by both the 
U S. Navy and the U S. Air Force, is a supersonic, 
missile-firing tactical bomber that can also de- 
liver small nuclear weapons It can be equipped 
with "smart" bombs that are guided to their tar- 
gets by laser beams; see Bomb. 

The F-111 is a jet fighter capable of flying at 
more than twice the speed of sound; a some- 
what larger version of the plane is used as a 
bomber New aircraft under development are 
the F-15, which excels at air-to-air defense tac- 
tics; the F-16, an all-purpose fighter, and the A- 
10, an attack plane designed for use m close 
support of troops on the ground. 

Aside from the F-4, the principal carrier-based 
aircraft in use by the U.S Navy are the F-14 
Tomcat, a swing-wing supersonic jet, and the A- 
6, an attack bomber. 

The B-52 Stratofortress, a subsonic plane first 
developed in the 1950's, is the principal long- 
range heavy bomber used by the U.S. Air Force. 
As part of the Strategic Air Command (SAC), it is 
capable of delivering nuclear weapons to any

The jumbo Air Force C-5A cargo airplane, 
which came into use in the early 1970's, is the 
largest and heaviest winged aircraft in the 
world It can rush 132 tons of troops and equip-

ful seaplane, a frc^nch design, flew in 1910. Air 
plane produc tic^n me reased considerably during 
World War I, when thi‘ military implications 
were rcnogni/ed. After the war, airlines were 
initiated, and a few yc^ars after the famous flight 
of the Amenc an aviator Charles Augustus Lind- 
bergh (qv.) to Fans in 1927, airline service 
girdled most of the globe. 

Rapid as theses developments were, none 
could compare* with the changes brought about 
at the c lose of World War 11 by jel propulsion

then Captain Charles E Yeager (1923- ) of the 
US Air Force, piloting the Bel! X-1 Another ex-

reached speeds m excess of 4500 m p h , when

and has been prolonged by refueling m midair 
Vertical takeoff of fixed-wing aircraft is a reality 
A revolutionary craft, known popularly as the 
flying platform and capable of both horizontal 
and vertical flight, was demonstrated m 1955 
Extremely simple to operate, the craft obtained 
both lift and propulsion through a set of con- 
trarotating propellers, which sucked air through 
holes in the frame 

One of the most advanced aircraft built by 
the U.S in the early 1960's is the strategic 
reconnaissance SR-71 "Black Bird", first revealed 
to the public late in 1974 A special titanium 
alloy was developed for the skin, which could 
withstand pressures of up to 200,000 lb per 
sq in at speeds estimated in excess of 2500 
m p.h and at altitudes of about 120,000 ft 
Equipped with powerful cameras, infrared sen- 
sors, and radio recorders, the SR-71 's were 
believed to be employed in monitoring military 
activities along the Soviet and Chinese borders

AIR POLLUTION, contamination of the at- 
mosphere by substances harmful to health. The 
contaminants may derive from natural sources, 
su(h as plant pollens or dust from open land 
However, most of the pollutants consist of the 
exhausts and waste created by motor vehicles, 
incinerators, and heating and electric-power 
systems Another important and dangerous 
source of air pollution is radioactive fallout. 

Between 2,000,000,000 and 3,000,000,000 tons 
of dirt and gaseous wastes drift into the atmos- 
phere each year in the U.S. About half the pol- 
lutants on the earth originate in 1 percent of the 
land area, which is occupied by 50 percent of 
the population If wind, temperature, and other 
meteorological factors do not permit the pollut- 
ing materials to disperse, respiratory and circu- 
latory complaints among the population may be 
expected to increase sharply 

The polluted air is often trapped by a phe- 
nomenon known as temperature inversion. Or- 
dinarily, warm air from the ground rises into the 
cooler air above But if a layer of warmer air 
forms above the air near the ground, or the air 
near the ground cools more rapidly than the air 
above it, the pollutants are trapped at ground

Health, Education, and Welfare to spend $428,- 
000,000 over a three-year period for expansion 
of Federal air-pollution control programs and 
for research and development of pollution-con- 
trol devices. The law allows each State to deter- 
mine its own air-quality standards, but entitles 
Federal authorities to establish controls should 
a State fail to act. 

In 1970 the U.S. Congress passed the so-called 
Clean Air Act that made it imperative for auto- 
mobile manufacturers to design engines that 
would eliminate 90 percent of the exhaust pol- 
lutants by 1975. To meet the petroleum shortage 
in the early 1970's, however, the deadline was 
moved back two years so that the automobile 
industry could design more efficient engines. 
Late in 1974, the manufacturers asked for a 
freeze on Federal automobile-emission stand- 
ards until 1980, and in january, 1975, President 
Gerald R. Ford (q.v.) expressed his support for 
such an extension. Environmentalists main- 
tained, nonetheless, that ''cleaner" engines 
could, with a more determined effort, be speed- 
ily designed and were preparing to fight the 
Issue in the U.S. Congress. 

See a/so Watir Poiiuhon, 

AIRPORT, terminal for landing and taking off 
of aircraft, with facilities and equipment for 
handling passt^ngers and cargo, and for servic- 
ing aircraft, large airports usually include the 
necessary facilities for aiding the operation of 
aircraft under both Instrument Flight Rules (I.F. 
R., whim visibility is so restricted that landings 
and takeoffs cannot be made visually), and Vis- 
ual Flight Rulers {V.F.R., when the weather per- 
mits safe flying by visual reference to the 
ground). See AiRiHANf ; Aviauon 

Airports, like other transportation terminals, 
have economic and social value; cities and 
towns are linked to the rest of the air-transpor- 
tation system by the airports. In the early 1970's 
more than 12,(XX) airports were operational in 
the United States, about bOO of them served by 
the regularly scheduled airlines. The Federal 
Aviation Administration (q.v.), or the F.A.A., 
which regulates the aviation industry for safety 
and operates the national public-air navigation 
system (see Airway) and air-traffic control sys- 
tem, anticipated an urgent need for several 
hyndred additional airports, including heliports 
and seaplane bases. By the late 1970's, the F.A.A. 
anticipated a commercial, business, and private 
air fleet of more than 175, (XX) aircraft, with 
about 260,000,000 paying passengers. In the 
early 197^0^s these figures were about 167,000 
and 202,000,000, respectively. 

About one third of U.S. airports are publicly 


owned and the rest are private, although many 
of the privately owned airports are open to pub- 
lic use as a business enterprise. They are oper- 
ated by individuals, corporations, special com- 
missions, terminal companies, or independent 
airport authorities. The Federal government 
owns and operates only two of the publicly 
owned airports, the Washington National Air- 
port and Dulles International Airport in subur- 
ban Virginia, which are operated by the F.A.A. 

In 1947 the Federal government began to en- 
courage the construction of new airports and 
the improvement of existing airports with 
matching grants. The Federal Aid-Airport Pro- 
gram (F.A.A.P.) is administered by the F.A.A., 
and only publicly owned airports are eligible for 
F.A.A.P. assistance. 

Facilities. Airport buildings are grouped under 
two broad headings, specifically, administra- 
tion-area buildings and hangars. An administra- 
tion or terminal building often includes offices 
and space for concessions, weather-bureau fa- 
cilities, traffic-control personnel offices, restau- 
rants, hotels, and airline ticket offices. In the ad- 
ministration-building area are the aircraft- 
parking zones, airplane-servicing facilities, 
and automobile-parking lots. 

Airport hangars are of two general varieties: 
large, multipurpose hangars capable of housing 
several aircraft, and small, T-shaped hangars for 
only one aircraft. Large hangars are often used 
as maintenance shops, and for storage of air- 
planes. 

Airports used exclusively by helicopters are 
called heliports; see Helicopter. Seaplane bases 
serve aircraft that can land on and take off from 
water. Airports operated by the military services 
are referred to as naval air stations, army air- 
fields, and air force bases. 

The arrival of the long-range commercial 
jetliners in the late 1950's required extension of 
existing airport runways. The best airfields in 
the U.S. provide at least one 10,000-ft. runway, 
and a few of the best equipped, such as O'Hare 
International, Chicago, 111., and Dulles Interna- 
tional near Washington, D.C, have parallel 
10,000-ft. runways for increased capacity. 
Longer runways are not believed to be needed; 
the so-called jumbo jets, such as the Boeing 747, 
and the airbuses, such as the Lockheed 1011 and 
McDonnell- Douglas DC-10, are expected to use 
existing runways. The increased weight of the 
jumbo jets, however, requires extensive 
strengthening of runways; the takeoff weight of 
the Boeing 747 may be over 700,000 lb. The su- 
personic transports (S.S.T.) are being designed 
to operate from facilities at the largest airports.

AIRPORT 


Problems of Air Traffic* 8y the early 19/irs, 
the growth in air traffic had generated ma- 
jor national problems in expediting the flights 
of commercial and business and pleasure air- 
craft at the major terminals. Lengthy delays 
had become commonplace during peak traffic 
periods, and the airlines had been forced to ad 
just some of their flight schedules as a tempo 
rary expedient. The long- range t>lan for automa 
tion of the traffic-control systt^m, t'xpecied to 
provide some relief, was well undtM’ way in i*n 
route control centers operated i>v tht‘ hA.A. and 
had started in the control towers, but a serious 
shortage of adequate airports remained. 

Noise Control* A major deterrent to the con*- 
struction of new airports in the 19?0*s was 
objection to aircraft noise. Existing airports, i>s- 
pecially after the introdut tion of jet »jirt raft, 
were besieged with complaints, Proposed new 
airport projects, in many kK at ions, were great ly 
delayed, as was the fourth major jetport tor the 
New York metropolitan t:omf){ex, or i am elled, 
Scientific measurements showe<i huh* increase 
in the total noise output of jet aircraft < ompared 
with the immediately prec eding piston and fur 
boprop aircraft, but the annoyanct^ ta< tor oi n*i 
noise was apparently greater. To rmniml/e dts 
turbance to those on the ground, all flights de 
parting from large airports in congested areas,

York City and Washington National, werr* re 
quired to rt^duce power and rate of climb after 
takeoff until the populated area was t leared, or 
to bypass highly populated areas. 

Some relief from jet-en-gine noise* W'tis m sight 
at the beginning of the ’I970N, as engirteers 
looked forward to a reduction ot about HI per 
cent with improved engine design and insula 
tion, but the ultimate solution appeared to Ih* 
better airport land-use planning for those air 
ports yet to be built. The supersonic transports, 
expected to be flying in regular s«*fvtce by the 
middle 1970's, were no noisier during landing 
and takeoff than the subsonic jets; see 
Propulsion; Suf««soHics, 

Short- Distance Tllghts. ft has been suggesteil 
that short takeoff and landing |S.I;0.id atreraft 
might provide some relief from the air and 
ground congestion in the T970N as these planes 
operate from, very short runway strips. These 
could bf! located near city centers or on saiellite 
fields around the major melropoiitan areas, and ,■ 
at major air terminals. Recent pubik opposition 
to the construction of new airfields near' large 
cities, however, has dampened the enthusiasm 
for. S.T.O.l. aircraft, and may give mm impetys 
to helicopf-er service using.iarger heiicoplers. In '

trollers were employed in all kinds of towers at 
any one time during this period. 

The equipment used by the controllers, in ad- 
dition to radar, includes light guns for commu- 
nicating with atrtraft that have no radio equip- 
ment, and a complex communications network 
of radio and telephone equipment. Computer- 
based automated radar terminal systems were in 
use at airports in the U.S. in the early 1970's. 

Tower service begins when the flier operating 
under V f .R. first radios in from about 15 to 20 
mi. away. If he is flying under l.f.R, and there- 
fore under the control of the f.AA. Air Route 
Traffic Control Center, the first call is made 
when the center controller transfers him to the 
approach controller in the fewer. 

After the lower controller acknowledges the 
airplane, he radios certain instructions to the 
pilot, prmc ipally direction and altitude of land- 
ing pattern, the active runway (the one to use, 
based on wind direction), wind direction and 
velocity, weather data, and altimeter setting. 
The pilot Is then directed to a position m the 
landing sequence. After landing, he is given 
taxiing instructions. The tower also assists the 
pilot in locating and identifying any other air- 
planes that he has to follow m the landing se- 
quence. 


The modem Charles de Caulle Airport, 12 mi north of 
Pans, was opened in 1974 The circular Terminal No 7, 
with Its seven satellite buildings, can handle up to 
10,000,000 passengers and 400,000 tons of freight annu- 

^lly, Adroport de Paris 

Generally, V.F R towers control air traffic 
within approximately a 5-mi. radius around the 
tower and up to any altitude In the case of ter- 
minal radar-control towers, the area is an irregu- 
lar shape of greater diameter The maximum 
altitude is usually limited to SCXX) ft or less 
Aids to Navigation. Bad-weather landings are 
facilitated by the radio-based Instrument Land- 
ing Systems (l.L S.), provided by the F A.A. at 
more than 300 airports in the early 1970's. The 
ground equipment transmits signals in two 
planes (vertical and horizontal, defining the 
landing path and the glideslope) Instruments in 
the aircraft cockpit indicate to the pilot how 
close he is to the landing path or the glideslope 
The LL.S. is used for the final portion of flight, 
from the time that terminal radar control has 
turned him onto the landing path 

Bad-weather takeoffs can be accomplished 
with only the instruments m the aircraft, in ad- 
dition to the instructions from radar departure 
controllers.

AIR PUMP 


AIR PUMP, See Am Compressor, 

AIRSHIP, !ighter-than-air craft equipped with 
a bag containing a gas to lift the ship, a means 
of propulsion, means for adjusting buoyancv, 
and one or more gondolas for the crew, passen- 
gers, and power units. The bag, usually contain- 
ing helium or hydrogen, is elongated or stream 
lined to enable easy passage through the air. 
The means of propulsion usually comprises one 
or more engines and propellers. A means tor re- 
leasing the ballast, usually sand or water, is used 
to increase buoyancy; and a means for releasing 
gas is used to reduce buoyancy. To sic‘er the air- 
ship, the pilot uses one or more vertically 
hinged rudders, and to control climb or descent 
employs one or more horizontally hirtged eleva 
tors. Airships, known also as dirigibles, were de 
veloped from the free i>alloof\ {q.vd. Three 
classes of airships are rect)gni/i»d; the nonrigiii 
commonly called blimp, in w^hich the form or 
the bag is maintained by prt^ssure the gas; the 
semirigid airship, in which, to rnamtain the 
form, gas pressure acts in conjunction wtih a 
longitudinal keel; and the rigid airship, in whi« h 
the form is delerminetl bv a rrgrd stryrtyfe, 
Technically all three classt^s mav be called dirrgr 
ble balloons, the word dingibk^ itemg derived 
from the Latin dirigfve, mt^uiing "to direr h to 
steer". 

The first successful airship was that t>r th«* 
French engineer and invemor Henri Oiffard 
(1825-1862), who in 1852 constructed a cigar 
shaped, nonrigid gas bag 141 ft. long, driven by 
a screw propeller rotated by a 1 h.p., steam en- 
gine. He flew over Paris at a S|ieed cil alMiyi h 
m.p.h. Giffard's airship c ould be s!i*4»fi‘d only m 
calm or nearly calm weather. The first airship to 
demonstrate its ability to return to its siarong 
place in a light wind was the la france, devef- 
oped in 18M by the french mvenlcirs Charlies

tured were surrendered to the Allies by the 
terms ot the Treaty of Versailles (q v,) in 1919 At 
the outbreak of the war, France had a fleet of 
semirigid airships, developed by officers of the 
French army The experience ot the war, how- 
ever, m disclosing the vulnerability of airships to 
airplane attack, caused the abandonment of the 
dirigible for offensive military purposes Non- 
rigid airships continued to be used for aerial ob- 
servation, coastal patrol, convoying, and locat- 
ing enemy submarines and mines, because ot 
their advantages over the airplane m being able 
to hover over a given location and to remain in 
the air for a longer pencxl See diso World War 
I Aircraft Operations (1914-13) 

Toward the end of World War I, the British 
began intensivt* dr^velopment ot rigid airships, 
stimulateti by the prosfKHt that noninllammable 
helium (qv.) gas would soon be available in 
quantity suffuient to inflate large ships. The 
R34, with a length ot f>41 ft anci a gas capac ity of 
1,980,IXX) cu ft, was commissioned in 1919 It 
made the first transatlantic flight of an airship, 
flying by way of Newfoundlanci from East For- 
tune, Scotland, to MincHila, N V,, and returning 
to Fulham, f ngland Ifx* total flying time for the 
rounci ifip was UH hr and IS mm., anci the ag- 
gregate' mileage about 7(KK) In 1921 the

< ornf>k'tc*ly wrc'ckc'd in a wind storm, with the' 
Icjss of tourtc'C'n cre'w membe'rs. The twenty- 
nine' survivors yndoubte'cJly owed their lives to 
the use e)l noru'xplosive he'lium for inflation. In 
1924 the U.S. Navy fc'cc'ivt'd dc'livery of the 
later christe'ned the' Los Angeles, made by the 
Zeppelin works in Ck'rmany as a partial payment 
of war reparations, fhis airship was 650 ft long 
and had a gas capacity of 2,47S,(XX) cu.ft. The 
control gondola also c arm'd accommodations 
for thirty passengers, with sleeping facilities 
similar to thene of a Pullman car The Los An- 
geles made about 250 flights, me ludmg trips to 
Puerto Rko and Panama, and sc'veral trips

across the continent It was decommissioned in 
1932 

In 1926 the Italian airship Norge, a semirigid 
craft of about 650,000 cu ft capacity, flew from 
Spitsbergen, Norway, over the North Pole to 
Teller, Alaska, where the ship was dismantled 
Another polar flight was attempted two years 
later in a similar ship, the Italia, but, after pass- 
ing over the Pole, it was wrecked on the return 
flight, with the loss of eight lives, see Arctic Ex- 
ploration 

The German Zeppelin plant in 1928 produced 
the Graf Zeppelin which had a length of 772 ft 
and a gas capacity of 3,710,000 cu ft It flew a 
total of more than 1,000,000 mi in nine years of 
service, crossing the Atlantic Ocean to North or 
South America 139 times, and making a com- 
plete trip around the world with stops only at 
Tokyo, )apan, Los Angeles, Calif , and Lakehurst, 
N) 

About the same time, the British resumed 
construction of rigid airships, launching the 
R100 and the RW1 in 1929 With lengths of 707 
ft and 724 ft respectively, these dirigibles had a 
gas capacity of 5,000,000 cu ft each The R101 
was powered by five 650 h p diesel engines, 
and had dining, sleeping, and recreational ac- 
commodations for 100 persons built into the 
hull. In October, 1930, on a flight to India, it 
crashed during a violent ram storm into a hill 
near Beauvais, France, and was completely de- 
stroyed by fire, 46 of the passengers and crew 
lost their lives The R700, which m the preced- 
ing August had made a round trip to Montreal, 
Canada, was scrapped after the destruction of 
the RWI, and the British government aban- 
doned construction of dirigibles 

Meanwhile, m 1928, the U.S. Navy purchased 
two dirigibles, each with a length of 785 ft , a 
gas capacity of 6,500,000 cu ft. of helium, and 
eight 560 h.p. engines. A novel feature of the 
design was provision for a hangar compartment 
in the ship capable of accommodating five 
scout airplanes, which could be released or 
taken aboard in flight. The first of these airships, 
the Akron, was completed in 1931, and was 
wrecked in a storm off the New Jersey coast m 
1933. The second ship, the Macon, was com- 
pletc'd in 1933, and wrecked in 1935 Since the 
Macon, the U S. has built no rigid airships 

The last and largest of the notable dirigible 
airships was the German-built Hindenburg, It 
had a lertgth of 804 ft., and a gas capacity of 6,- 
710,000 cu ft. After making ten transatlantic 
crossings m regular commercial service in 1936, 
it was destroyed by fire m 1937 when it was 
landing al Lakehurst on its first trip of the sea-

Since the construction of the Hnnhmbuf^, an 
ship activity has been confineti Uy the* nonrigid 
type of crafts. In 19^^ all military hlimps in the 
U.S, were placed und(*r Na\> junsdii tion, with 
the Naval Air Station at lak(*hyrst as ermter of 
operations. During World War II, bhrnps were 
employed for patrol, scouting, convov. and an 
tisubmarine work. In addition to mihtarv craib a 
private commercial firm in the 11 S. has devt*! 
oped several small nonrigid airships, that are 
used chiefly in carrying large displav signs tor 
advertising purposes and for tarrving lelevision 
crews and equipment for taking aerial vh*vvs of 
sports events and other ncgable occasions. 

After World War II the U,S. Nass t ontinyed to 
develop the airship for such purposes as an 
tisubmarine warfare, intc^rmcHliaie search rniS"' 
sions, and early warning missions, I he largest of 
Navy airships, the ZPC^l type, was 124 ft, long 
and had a capacity of B75.CXX) cu fi of helium.. 
An airship of this type stayed aloft without re- 
fueling for more than 2C'XI hr, the U.S Navy dis-'

tions and rapidly developed by a number of 
near Eastern and Asian countries Cooperative 
agreements among air-transport companies of 
different nations were concluded, and the Inter- 
national Civil Aviation Organization (q v ) was 
formed in 1947 to establish international stand- 
ards and regulations 

Air-carner operations in the U S were mod- 
ernized during the first postwar decade The 
change in equipment began in 1946, when sur- 
plus military tour-engine air<ratt became availa- 
ble for airline use Subsequently, new multi- 
engine designs, featuring pressurized cabins 
and improved instrumentation, were intro- 
duced The total number of air transports in 
1946 was approximately 67S, mostly two-engme, 
piston-dnven types I hese were supplanted first 
by four-engine piston-cinven planes and later by 
jet-propelled planes In the mid-1970s about 
2360 transport airplanes were in service, of 
which about 2070 were jet-propelled craft In 
addition to use on long-distance, nonstop 
flights, jet-propelled airliners had come into 
extensive use for shorter hauls. 

The number of domestic passengers earned 
by U S, airlines increasc^d from about 12,000,000 
in 1946 to about 1 78,CKX),(XX) in the middle of the 
1970S.

which compares favorably with the best safety 
records of omnibus lines and railroads and is 
considc*rably better than that for private auto- 
mobiles. Some twenty years later, the rate had 
further declined to a third of that in 19ST In 
1959 the Civil Aeronautics Administration was 
absorbed by the* newly forrneti Tecferal Aviation 
Agency, which assumed responsibility for regu- 
lation of civil aviation in the U.S. The National 
Transportation Safety Boarci has responsibility 
for investigating aircraft accidemts See FfDtftAi 
Aviation Aoministraiion 

The schc*dyled airliners in the early 1970's had 
an investment of about $1 2,CXX),0CX),000 and 
employed approximately 300, (XX) persons. With 
the introduction of jet propulsion, the airlines 
of the world entered a period of overcapacity, a 
term embracing ail the industry's major ills* 
excessive competition, rising sc**at-mile costs, 
and decreasing aircraft-utilization rates To rem- 
edy this situation, a number of airline mergers 
were carried out m the early 1970's, together 
with a cutback in operations over existing 
airlme routes. 

The U.S. far exceeds other countries in the 


number of passenger-miles regularly flown, with 
about 115,350,000,000 domestic passenger-miles 
flown annually in the early 1970's The world is 
also covered with an intricate network of routes 
by such airline services as British Airways, of 
Great Britain; Air France, of France, Sabena, of 
Belgium, Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS), of 
Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, Lufthansa-Ger- 
man Airlines, of West Germany, Japan Air Lines 
(JAL), of japan, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, of the 
Netherlands, and Aeroflot, of the Soviet Union 
In the early 1970's about 4,393,000,000 miles 
were flown annually by members of the Interna- 
tional Civil Aviation Organization, including the 
US 

Passenger and Crew Safety Measures. As 

commercial airlines fly faster and higher, meas- 
ures to improve passenger and crew safety are 
constantly being studied and implemented Un- 
like military aircraft, commercial airliners are 
not equipped with parachutes and ejection 
seats Most jet airliners cruise at altitudes of 
about 30,000 ft , and safe bailout at such an alti- 
tude without pressure suit and oxygen mask 
would be very unlikely 

Because of the high cruising altitudes, consid- 
erable attention is paid to maintaining safe and 
comfortable cabin pressure Oxygen-pumping 
equipment is regularly checked Recent F A A 
regulations for new jet airliner designs require 
reciuced window area The objective is to limit 
cabin decompression to a tolerable level in the 
event of a window failure Various means of 
minimizing injuries during emergency landings 
are being studied and tested Seating passengers 
facing rearward was considered, but the practi- 
cal values of this seating are questionable, and it 
IS considered psychologically undesirable. An- 
other alternative is to secure the passengers very 
firmly by some means during an emergency 
landing. In one procedure, passengers are in- 
structed to place pillows and rolled blankets be- 
tween them and the seats in front of them The 
success of this procedure has also prompted 
studies of various inflatable cushioning devices, 
which could normally be stored inconspicu- 
ously in the backs of seats and inflated auto- 
matically if needed Inflatable slide chutes have 
also been successfully used in emergencies to 
help passengers leave aircraft rapidly

bombing. Strategicalty, air warfare includes the 
bombardment of the enemy's factories, commu- 
nications systems, and population centers, and 
securing and maintaining command of the air. 
18th and 19th Centuries, lighter-than-air bal- 
loons were the first vehicles of air warfare. In 
1794, eleven years after the first balloon ascen- 
sion at Versailles, France, French army observers 
at Fleurus during the wars of the French Revolu- 
tion helped direct artillery fire against the Aus- 
trians while floating above the battlefield ir^ 
tethered balloons. 

The United States first used military balloons 
in 1862-63 during the Civil War when the Army 
of the Potomac was able to observe Confeder 
ate movements. When Paris was under siege 
during the Franco-German War (q.v.), sixty four 
balloons crossed over the German lines, 
carrying about 4, OCX), (XX) letters, eighty eight 
passengers (induding leun Gambetta (q.v.) 
minister of the French Republic), and a great 
many homing pigeons which returned to the 
city with messages. A balloon sent to Cuba 
during the Spanish-American War (q.v.) was 
used to direct American artillery fir(‘ at the 
battle of San Juan. 

Early 20th Century. 8y the tregnmmg of the 
20th century, the aeronauts ('ount Ferdinand 
von Zeppelin and Alberhi Santos Dumont 
(qq.v.) had developed cylindfH al shaped, inter 
nally reinforced balloons with attac hed, engine 
driven propellers that wt^re capable of dim tml 
flight (see AiRSHie). The Germans had two /ep- 
pelins when World War I staned, but hyrnedly

ain aftc*f the defeat of France ir"i 1940, they de- 
stroyed fn*ithc*r the* British capacity to produce 
nor the* will to tight. With the* help of the newly 
developed radar (cpv.), British fighters com- 
pelled the* CaTinans to afiandon day attacks and 
resort to less i*ff<Htive night bombings. 

In 1942, bombe*fs of the Royal Air Force, Stir 
lings, Haltlaxcw, and laruastc*rs, together with 
American B I7S and B i4's based m Fngland, 
laun(hc*d a Combmed B(Knbc*f Offensive 
against (Germany and C^erman held targets in 
Europe. British night bombers made saturation 
attacks against Gc^rman cities and large* indus- 
trial complexes. American bombers carried out 
daylight attacks of precision bombing against 
specific industrial aneJ mifiiary targets. The 
American planes suffer<*ci heavy losses until late 
1943, when long-range fight<*r escorts-P-51 
Mustangs and P-47 Ihunderbirds-became avail- 
able. Bombers could then fly deep into Ger- 
many with relative impunity. 


In World War !, American air units in France 
had carried out 150 separate bombing attacks 
and dropped 138 tons of bombs In World War 
11, the Combined Bomber Offensive dropped 
about 2,700,000 tons of bombs on enemy tar- 
gets Strategic bombers occasionally gave close 
tactical support to ground troops, notably at 
Monte Cassino, Italy, and Caen and Saint-L6, 
France 

German developments indicated the future of 
air warfare, when the V-1, a pilotless plane pro- 
pelled by a pulse-jot engine and carrying 2000 
lb ot explosives was launched against English 
targets in June, 1944 (see Guided Missiles) The 
V-2, a true guided missile about 47 ft long, 5 5 
ft. in diameter, and weighing 27,000 lb , was first 
used m September, 1944 It developed 55,000 lb 
of thrust and earned about 1650 lb of explosives 
a maximum distance of 200 mi The first jet air- 
craft, the German Messerschmitt 262, flew m 
combat in 1945, but in insufficient numbers to 
have any appreciable effect. See a/so Jet Pro- 
pulsion, Rockfi 

The war in the Pacific similarly showed the 
importance of air power, from the Japanese at- 
tack on Pearl Harbor, through the naval battles 
ol the Coral Sea (qv), Midway (see Midway 
I siANDs), the Solomon Islands, and Bismarck Sea, 
to the decisive Battle of Leyte Gulf 

The major purpose of capturing the Marianna 
Islands (q.v.) was to obtain a base from which 
B-29 bombers could attack Japan The Battle of 
Iwo Jima too, was fought to secure a landing 
field for damaged bombers returning from raids 
and for escort fighters The B-29 bombers began 
Fjombing Japan systematically in 1944, and by 
1945 a senes ot large-scale incendiary attacks 
had destroyed Japan's major cities The first 
atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima by a 
B-29 on Aug 6, 1945, and the second was 
droppt'd on Nagasaki three days later 
Postwar Era* After the war, the German 
scientists who had developed the V-1 and V-2 
guided missiles emigrated to the U S and the 
Soviet Union in large numbers. By the 1950's, 
families of surface-to-air, surface-to-surface, air- 
to-air, air-to-surface missiles, and missiles fired 
from underwater were adopted by the armed 
forces of major nations. See Guided Missiles 

Since the early I950's, air power has been 
considered the decisive form of power, first be- 
cause manned bombers could carry atomic 
weapons, and later because rockets and guided 
missiles could strike targets anywhere with great 
accuracy and overwhelming force. By the 1960's, 
the manned bomber had become obsolete as a 
strategic weapon.

The liniJteci wars fought since World War II 
show a continuing ust‘ ten’ ta< tical rnannc‘d air- 
craft. Thc‘ Korean War marked the transition 
from prof>eller (inve^n to \vi aircraft It also 
marked the first large* sc ait* ust* of h(*lKopters to 
perform tht* functions of liaison, observation, 
fire control, transportation of troops and weap- 
ons, and mtniical t'vacualton; these functions 
had previously been carri<*d out by winged air- 
craft Heli<.c^pters were used even more inten- 
sively in the Vietnam conflict, becoming the 
primary air weapon for the close support of 
ground troops. 

The wmged fighter bombers sue h as the U.S. 
Navy A-7's ami the U.S. Air Force f-4 Phantoms 
and F-10SS wcw used in Vietnam primarily to 
soften enemy concentrations with tactical 
strikes or for precision bombing of urban tar- 
gets. The high-altitude B-S2 strategic bombers 
were used for the so-called carpet-bombing 
missions.

AIRWAY^ originally defined as a straight line 
conncH img navtgational-radio transmitting sites, 
or the intersection of straight lines connecting 
two sites; by the beginning of the 1970'$, the 
term '"airway'" had bc*come obsolete. See Radio 
Aids io NAViciAtiON Although the Federal Avia- 
tion Administration (q.v.), or F.A.A., still defined 
and maintained over 200,000 mi. of airways m 
the airspace over the continental United States, 
a new area-control concept had been Intro- 
duced in 1960. By 1970 virtually all the airspace

over the continental US above 24,000-ft alti- 
tude was defined as A P C (Area of Positive 
Control) airspace In the heavily traveled cen- 
tral-northeastern portion, the A P C altitude is 
above 18,000 ft. All flight in this airspace, 
whether on established airways or not, is under 
ground control of the F.AA Air Route Traffic 
Control Centers, and pilots must fly by Instru- 
ment Flight Rules (I F.R.) and have relatively ad- 
vanced electronics communication and identifi- 
cation equipment (radar transponder) 

Governmental agencies such as the Civil Aer- 
onautics Administration (q v ), now the FA.A, 
were established for the regulation of civil 
routes and air-traffic control Commercial air- 
craft are required to follow approved flight 
plans specifying routes, speeds, altitudes, and 
reporting points along the route 
Once the aircraft has left the vicinity of the 
airport, and is making its transition to the en 
route portion of flight, control of its route pas- 
ses to the nearest Air Route Traffic Control Cen- 
ter if It IS flying under an I F R. flight plan The 
Air Route Traffic Control Centers are responsi- 
ble for providing the distance between 1 F R air- 
craft flying in the controlled airspace 

The plane remains the responsibility of an in- 
dividual center until it leaves the jurisdiction 
(about 300 to 500 mi.) of that center, then the 
plane is turned over to the next center, and so 
on. At designated points along his route, the

pilot radios his position to the (ontroller, who 
enters this information on the tlight progress 
strip that represents that particular flight These 
progress strips are then placed on a sloping 
board m front of the controller In those «ireas 
having radar coverage, the controller sees the 
airplane he controls on a raciar screen with a 
range of approximately 2{X) mi, PiU>t and con 
troller c^ornmunicate by voice on radio. Vifhen 
the airplane is approximately 20 mi from its

AKIBA BEN JOSEPH (about 50-117) Jewish 
rabbi and martyr, resident in Palestine, During 
his youth, according to tradition, he was a shep- 
herd. He began the stueJy of the law at the com- 
paratively advanced age of forty years, but he 
rose to a preeminent position as "the father 
of rabbinic Judaism", He regarded the Jewish 
leader Simon Bar Cocheba (q.v.), who headed 
the great Jewish revolt against Rome during the 
reign of Emperor Hadrian (q.v.), as the promised 
Messiah and applied to him the title "son of the 
star", Akiba was imprisoned for transgressing 
Hadrian's edict forbidding the practice and 
teaching of the Jc'wish religion; he was subse- 
quently flayed to cieath in the ancient Palestin- 
ian city of Caesarea. Akiba is om* of the "ten 
martyrs" named m ihe penitential prayers of the 
Jews, 

Akiba laid the basis of the Mishnah (q.v.) by 
beginning the* systematization of Jewish oral 
law. In addition he cultivatc'd a method of scrip- 
tural exegesis that ts a characteristic feature of 
Talmudic literature. He taught that love one has 
for one's fellow man is the* central command- 
ment, that man has free will, and that God's atti- 
tude toward the world is compounded of jus- 
tice and mercy.

ALABAMA 


Black Warrior, and Alabama rivers. The Alabama 
R, with Its tributaries, the Coosa, Tallapoosa, 
and Cahaba rivers, drains a larger area of the 
State than any other river; it joins the Tombig- 
bee about 44 miles n, of Mobile to form the Mo- 
bile R The Conecuh, Choctawhatchee, and 
Chattahoochee rivers flow s into the Gulf of 
Mexico, the last-named river forming part of the 
Alabama-Georgia border. Other artificial lakes 
in Alabama are Martin lake on the Tallapoosa 
R., Lay and Mitchell lakes on the Coosa, and 
Bankhead Lake on the Black Warrior. 

Climate. Alabama has a temperate climate, 
which becomes subtropical near the coast. The 
summers are long, hot, and humid, with little 
day-to-day temperature change. In the ne, 
higher altitudes help to cool the summer nights, 
and from late lune through mid-August occa- 
sional afternoon thumfershowers bring cool

Wf fCONOMfy 

Alabama has a diversified economy. The per 
capita persona! income in 1976 was $5105, com- 
pared with thc^ U.S, average of $6441. Agricul- 
tural workers made up about 7 percent of em- 
ployees, and nonagricultural workers were 
employed, tn descending order of numbers, in 
manufacturing, government, wholesale and re- 
tail trade, service industries, construction, trans- 
portation and public utilities, and finance, real 
estate, and insurance 

Between 1970 and 1977 the State's population 
increasecJ by about 7 percent, a bit more than 
the national average. Its percentage of working- 
age population was somewhat less than that of 
the U.S. as a whole. Civilian workers numbered 
1,4B0,00D In thi^ mid- 1970% a sizable proportion 
of them employed by the lextite and primary 
metals industries. The Federal government em- 
ployed 56, .500.

Manufacturing, industrial growth m Alabama 
has been rapid in recent decades, largely be- 
cause of the abundance of mineral resources 
and labor and the availability of waterpower 
and inland navigable waterways. Industrial 
growth during the period 1%4-69 totaled $2 4 
billion and added 112,000 new jobs. According 
to a recent survey of manufactures, production 
workers in Alabama in the mid-1970's totaled 
51T,000. Most of them were employed in textile 
mills, apparel manufacture, primary metals in- 
dustries (iron and steel), and in lumber and 
wood products plants About one fifth of the 
workers were employed in the Standard Metro- 
politan Statistical Area of Birmingham; a little 
less than half of these worked m the city of Bir- 
mingham Other manufacturing centers are 
Huntsville, Mobile, Columbus, Tuscaloosa, and 
Gadsden. The Birmingham-Bessemer-Gadsden 
district constitutes one of the major iron- and 
steel-producing sections of the country. The 
value added by manufacture (see Value) m the 
largest industries totaled $1.19 billion for pri- 
mary metals, $743,800,000 for paper and allied

products, and $610,5CX),000 for food and food 
products The textile and apparel manufacturing 
industries, although most Important in terms of 
numbers of workers employed, were of lesser 
importance in terms of value added, accounting 
for $501,900,000 and $464,300,000, respectively 
The value added by all manufacture in Alabama 
was about $6 62 billion annually 
Agriculture. Alabama ranks twenty-sixth 
among all States in value of cash receipts from 
agriculture About 94,000 people are employed 
on some 77,000 farms covering 14,500,000 acres. 
The average size of a farm in Alabama is 188 
acres The most important agricultural com- 
modities are broiler chickens, cattle, soybeans, 
and eggs Alabama's total cash receipts from ag- 
riculture in the mid-1970's were about $1 62 bil- 
lion, of which $993,226,000 came from livestock 
and $624,722,000 from crops. Poultry production 
has been the State's fastest growing agricultural 
enterprise, increasing by some 3000 percent 
since 1947. Alabama is seventh in the nation in 
cotton production and second in peanuts. 
Fishing. Alabama has fisheries that provide 
significant catches of shrimp, oysters, crabs, 
mullet, and menhaden. The oyster and crab fish* 
enes are centered in Mobile Bay and the Missis- 
sippi R estuary, shrimp are found m the same 
waters and in the Gulf of Mexico. The c atch var- 
ies considerably from year to year; in the mid- 
1970's it was about 31,000,000 lb. annually, val- 
ued at about $21,000,000. About 2150 fishermen 
are employed m the State 
Mining. Alabama ranks eighteenth among the 
States in value of mineral production. In the 
mid-1970's the annual value of minerals pro- 
duced was about $%9,000,000. The principal 
products, in order of value, are bituminous coal, 
petroleum, cement, and stone. 

Energy. In the mid-1970's Alabama produced 
56 6 billion kw hours of electric energy annually, 
more than half of it generated by private com- 
panies. The Tennessee Valley Authority and util- 
ity companies operated five nuclear-power reac- 
tors as well as four hydroelectric plants of more 
than 150,0CX)-kw capacity. 

Forestry. The forest land of Alabama is about 
two thirds softwoods and one third hardwoods. 
Primarily under private ownership, the forest 
land comprises some 21,700,000 acres. It pro- 
duces a net annual cut of sawtimber of some 2.9 
billion bd.ft. 

Transportation. The first railroad in Alabama 
was the Tuscumbia Ry., inaugurated on June 12, 
1832, and now part of the Southern Ry. In addi- 
tion to the Southern, the Stale is served fay sev- 
eral other Class 1 railroads; there are about 4500

ALABAMA 


HISTORY 

in prehistoric times the region comprising pres- 
ent-day Alabama was inhabited by Indians who 
lived in a Stone Age culture Many tribes built 
mounds as burial places and sometimes for de- 
fense purposes Some of the mounds are still 
standing, notably in Moundville, Hale County, 

The first white men to penetrate the region 
were the Spanish explorers Alonso de Ptfieda, 
who entered what is now Mobile Bay in 1519, 
and P^nfilo de Narvaez (1480? -1528), who in 
1528 explored the southern part of the region 
Hernando de Soto (q.v ) reached a site near the 
present-day city of Mobile on Oct. 18, 1540, 
after winning a costly victory over the Choctaw 
Indians in the battle of Maubila, 

The first permanent settlement was estab* 
Itshed by Jean Baptiste Lemoyne, Sieur de Bien- 
ville (q.v.), French governor of Louisiana, when, 
in 1702, he transferred the seat of the colony 
from Biloxi to Mobile Bay. Not until 1711, how- 
ever, did the French lay out the site of present- 
day Mobile, which with the surrounding terri- 
tory was then considered part of Louisiana. In 
1763 France ceded the territory to Great Sfilam 
under the Treaty of Paris, the peace settlement 
that terminated the French and Indian War. In 
1783 Great Britain ceded the southern part of 
the region, including West Florida, to Spam. All 
of southern Alabama except the region project- 
ing south of the 31st parallel was ceded to the 
United States by Spain in 1795. In 1813 the U.S. 
annexed the remainder of Spanish-held Ala- 
bama, basing its action on the provisions of the 
Louisiana Purchase (q.v,), Alabama was organ- 
ized as a Territory in 1817 and admitted as a 
State in 1819. 

On Jan. 11, 1861, without a popular vote 
having been held, Alabama seceded from the 
Union and joined the Confederate States of 
America (q.v.). The Confederate government 
was organized on Feb. 4, 1861, at Montgomery, 
which served as the capital of the Confederacy 
until June of that year After the close of the 
Civil War a provisional governor was appointed 
in June, 1865, by U.S. President Andrew Johnson 
(q.v.). 

At a constitutional convention (Septem- 
ber, 1865), the act of secession was repealed, a 
new State constitution was adopted, and slavery 
was abolished. Following the November elec- 
tions, the national government recognized the 
State legislature; the governor-elect was inaugu- 
rated in December after the State had ratified 
the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution 
of the United States (q.v.). The United States 
Congress, however, under the influence of the 

334 


'Tadicais" (as the Repul>lHans vvere known), re- 
fused to seat the newlv elected Alabama delega- 
tions The State was placetJ under Federal mili- 
tarv control on Marc h 2, \Bb7, In June, 1868, 
Congress readmitted Alabama to the Union 
after a nev\ State constitution had been drawn 
up and the Fourteenth Amendment to the Con- 
stitution had been ratified. The Fifteenth 
Amendmemt was ratified bv Alabama on Nov 
16, ]870, 

During the Rec onstfy< non (q v ) period fol- 
lowing the Cisfl War, Alabama was torn by 
party dissension ancJ extravagance and dishon- 
esty in official circles. The election of the Dem- 
ocratic leader George S Houston as governor m 

1874 herakied the end of the Reconstruction pe- 
riod 

following the restoralHm ut home rule in Ala- 
bama, tht‘ Slate entered an era of industrial de- 
velopment that has charatlen/ed its history to 
the present time. I he dec ade between 1880 and 
1890 saw the iron and steel industry rise to a 
dommmi position Ihe first blast furnace in 
Alabama began operaiicMi m Birmingham in 
1880, ami eight vears later steel was rolled at 
Bessemer This was one also of rapid de- 

velopment in coal mimng 1hc‘ following cJec- 
ade, 189f) to was a period of rapid growth 
of the cotton textile industry 

farm lenanc y was a st'ocuis problem between 

1875 and IN' liasu ciifluyloes were the 
prevalence of unskilled laborers and the scarcity 
of money and credit The landowners, who had 
little mor\4*y, wcfrked tml share arrangements 
wtih their tenants, whc> knew no way to make a 
living except farming, As fate as 1915, sixty-four 
out of lOd Alabama farmers were sharecroppers. 
Federal aid plus the growth of private industry 
and Its demamJ for lalKrr greaily reduced farm 
ler^anry Bv 1941 Alabama agriculture had 
reached a lurning pome Since that year de- 
creases have occyrred m the number of farmers 
and farms and the liJtai farm ac reage; but farm 
income and size, value of crtips, and mechani- 
zation have increased 

Following the 1954 decision of the Supreme 
Court of the United States (q v.) on school seg- 
regation, Alabama politics was dominated by 
ihe rate issue In 19% the Rev. Martin Luther 
King, |r (q.v.b emerged as the leader of a bus 
boycott m Mimtgomerv that contributed to the 
ending of so-called lim Crow segregation laws. 
King's effons m Birmingham and Seima pro- 
duced violence that attracted national attention 
and conifibuled to the passage of the 1965 Civil 
Rights Act in reaction to Federal intervention, 
white Alabamians turned to the leadership of 



ALABAMA, UNIVERSITY OF 


George Corley Wallace (q v.), who served as 
governor from 1%3 to l%7 and as adviser to his 
wife, Lurleen Burns Wallace (1926-68), who was 
elected in 1966 Wallace formed a third party, 
the American Independent Party, and ran un- 
successfully for President in 1%8 Wallace again 
was elected governor in 1970, and he was re- 
elected in 1974. 

Both in State and national politics, Alabama 
has been a stronghold of the Democratic Party 
The Democrats earned the State m every Presi- 
dential election from 1876 to 1960 except in 
1948 Because they opposc^cj the civil-nghts pro- 
gram of President Harry S Truman (q v,), about 
half of the Alabama delegation left the National 
Convention of the Democratic Party m 1948 
These cielegates later joined Democrats from 
twelve other Southern States to form the States' 
Rights Democratic Party. In the election the 
regularly elected Democratic electors in Ala- 
bama voted for the States' Rights candidates. But 
beginning in 1%4, the State's voting pattern 
changcHi dramatic ally, when Barry M Goldwater 
became the* first Republican Presidential candi- 
date to carry Alabama since I872. 

in th(' early 1^)60's Alabama entered a period 
of gre^at social and economic change. There 
have been steaciy <‘ffcjrts to attract industry to 
the State; to improve health, educational, and 
other social and economic services; to seek 
greater interracial coc^peration; and to enlarge 
Alabama's transportation network. These efforts 
have been coupled with improved employment 
opportunities for Blacks, notably in the State's 
public service sector. Although race relations re- 
main an important issue, Alabama's Blacks are 
slowly gaining an evc*f stronger voice in State 
and local politics. 

ALABAMA, Ofie of the prmc ipal rivers of the 
State of Alabama, formed by the junction of the 
Coosa and Tallapoosa rivers at a point 10 miles 
N.f of the city of Montgomery. It is about 315

American Civil War. The claims were made to 
compensate the U.S. for damages inflicted on 
American property by the Confederate steam- 
ship Alabama, a T040“ton vessel that was built at 
Birkenhead, Cngland. lust before the British gov- 
ernment issued an order calling for her deten- 
tion in port, the ship put to sea, became a 
raider, and captured or destroyed seventy U.S. 
ships. When the Alabama reached Cherbourg, 


France, for refitting on June 11, 1864, the U.S 
warship Kearsarge engaged her m battle outside 
the port and succeeded in sinking her. 

The Alabama claims were not completely set- 
tled until 1885 The U.S claims were based 
chiefly on the alleged failure of the British gov- 
ernment to prevent the building of the Alabama 
and other Confederate ships, and on the fur- 
nishing of supplies to the Confederate ships at 
British ports A tribunal of arbitrators, appointed 
by representatives of the US, Great Britain, 
Italy, the Swiss Confederation, and Brazil, met m 
Geneva from 1871 to 1872, and decided that 
Great Britain should pay the U S damages of 
$16,145,830. Subsequently two courts of com- 
missioners, appointed by the Congress of the 
U.S, sat {1874-76 and 1882-85) to determine the 
distribution to injured individuals and firms of 
the funds received through the Alabama claims 
Congress also determined the distribution of 
other funds, included within the award of the 
Geneva tribunal, based on depredations by the 
Confederate privateerships Florida and Shenan-

ALABAMA, THE UNIVERSITY OF, a system of 
three coeducational State-controlled institu- * 
tions of higher education, with campuses at 
University, near Tuscaloosa, Birmingham; and 
Huntsville. The university was established m 
1820 and opened in Tuscaloosa in 1831. In 1943 
a medical college was established in Birming- 
ham, and m 1966 a branch campus in Huntsville 
In 1%9 the three campuses received autonomy, 
but a single board of trustees was retained. The 
Tuscaloosa campus comprises colleges of arts 
and sciences, education, commerce and busi- 
ness administration, community health sciences 
and engineering; the division of continuing ed- 
ucation; graduate school; graduate school of li- 
brary service; The New College; and schools of 
home economics, law, mines, and social work. 

At Birmingham, the major divisions are the 
Medical Center, with schools of community and 
allied health resources, dentistry, medicine, 
nursing, optometry and the university hospitals 
and clinics; and the University College, with 
schools of arts and sciences, business, educa- 
tion, and engineering The Huntsville campus 
includes schools of nursing and allied health 
sciences, humanistic studies, and science and 
engineering, and graduate and research studies, 
as well as a division of continuing education. 
Degrees of bachelor, master, and doctor are 
granted. In 1972 the libraries housed more than 
1,500,000 bound volumes. Student enrollment in

ALABAMINE, former name of the element as- 
tatine (q.v.) 

ALABASTER, name of two marbleiike miner- 
als. One variety. Oriental alabaster, was exten- 
sively used by the ancient Egyptians. It is a vari- 
ety of catcite (q v.), with hardness 3; it is usually 
white and translucent, but is often banded with 
dark or colored streaks. The other mineral, 
called modern alabaster, is a variety of gypsum 
(q.v), usually snow-white in color with a uni- 
form, fine grain. Modern alabaster is softer 
(hardness 1 5) than Oriental alabaster, and is 
easily carved into intricate shapes. Deposits of 
fine gypsum alabaster are found in Italy and 
England. 

ALACOQUE, Saint Marguerite Marie (1647- 
90), French nun, born in Lauthecourt, France. 
She attributed her recovery from paralysis to the 
Virgin Mary, and entered the convent at Paray- 
le-Monial in 1671. Her visions of Christ, m 
which He revealed to her His bleeding and 
compassionate heart, gave impetus to the mod- 
ern Roman Catholic practice of devotion to the 
Sacred Heart She was beatified m 1864 and 
canonized in 1920; her feast day ts Oct. 17. 
ALADDIN, hero of the story '^Aladdin and the 
Wonderful Lamp'' in the Oriental folklore col- 
lection known as the Arabian Nights (q.v.). 
Aladdin, a poor Oriental boy, comes into pos- 
session of a magic lamp. By rubbing it, he can 
always summon the genie of the lamp, who ful- 
fills such extravagant demands as winning Alad- 
din a princess as his bride and building a mag- 
nificent palace in a single night. Later incidents 
in the tale include the loss of the lamp to a cun- 
ning African magician. Eventually, the magician 
is slain and the lamp recovered, and Aladdin 
and the princess are restored to their palace.

ALAIN DE LILLE or ALANUS AB INSULIS or 
ALANUS DE INSULIS (1114?-1203?), Flemish 
theologian and philosopher, famous for the ex- 
tensiveness of his knowledge. He received his 
name from the town of Lille, Flanders (now 
France), probably his birthplace. Comparatively 
little is known of his life. He lived at Montpel- 
lier, France, and eventually entered a Cistercian 
monastery. He wrote, chiefly in verse, on al- 
chemy, natural philosophy, and theological 
subjects. His works include De Fknctu Naturae, 
(about 1160-70; Eng. trans.. The Complaint of 
Nature, 1908), a satire on human vices, and Anti- 
daudianus (about 1182, Eng. trans., 1935), a trea- 
tise on arts and morals. 


ALAIN-FOURNIER, pen name of HENRI 
ALAIN FOURNIER (1886-1914), French writer, 
born m la Chapefle-d'Angillon. He was the au- 
thor ot only one novel, Lo Grand Meaulnes 
(1913, Eng. trans, Ihe Wanderer, 1958), which 
with its mystic tweriones and spiritual quality 
differed greatly from the realistic and naturalis- 
tic fiction ot hfs contemporaries and exerted 
great influence on succeeding writers. His 
promising c areer was < ut short by World War I; 
he was reported missing alter the fighting of 
Sept. 22. 1914, in Frame, and was presumed 
dead. Most ot his writing was published after 
his death. Mirac/es (1924) is a collection of his 
early verse and prose, much of which had been 
published previously in various periodicals.

ALAMO, THE, former Franciscan mission m 
San Antonio, Texas, erected about 1722, later 
used as a fort, and now preserved as a State 
monument. The Alamo was the site of the most 
heroic episode of the Texan war of independ- 
ence against Mexico (see Texas History), On 
Feb. 23, 1836, a Mexican force of about 40CX) 
men commanded by Antonio Lopez de Santa 
Anna (q.v }, general and later president of Mex- 
ico, reached the outskirts of San Antonio, which 
had been captured by the Texan insurgents the 
previous December The San Antonio garrison, 
only 155 men under the command of Colonel 
William Barrett Travis (q.v,), withdrew to the 
Alamo. Santa Anna deployed his troops around 
the structure and, when his artillery arrived, 
launched an intensive assault The Texans, who 
were reinforced by 32 men on March 1, with- 
stood the Mexicans until March 6, when the 
enemy succeeded m breaching the mission 
walls, Travis, his chief aides, including the 
American frontiersmen David (''Davy") Crock- 
ett and James Bowie (qq.v.), and the remainder 
of the garrison perished in the savage hand-to- 
hand struggle that followed. Of the 187 Texan 
defenders of the Alamo only six survived the 
siege, and General Santa Anna ordered each of 
them killed. At the subsequent battle of San Ja- 
cinto, in which Santa Anna was defeated, the 
battle cry of the Texans was "Remember the 
Alamo!"

ALANS or ALANI^ Iranian-speakmg nomadic 
tribe of the ancient world, one of the peoples 
known as Sarmatians (q.v,). They first appeared

ALANUS AB INSULIS. See Alain de lille 
ALARCON, Hernando de (fi 16th cent ), 
Spanish navigator and explorer in America On 
May 9, 1540, Alarcbn sailed to the head of the 
Gulf of California and completed the explora- 
tions begun by the Spanish explorer Francisco 
de Ulloa (d 1540) in the preceding year During 
this voyage Alarcdn proved to his satisfaction 
that there was no open-water passage between 
the Gulf of California and the South Sea, or Pa- 
cific Ocean Subsequently he entered the Colo- 
rado R, which he named the Buena Guia He 
was the first European to ascend the river for a 
distance considerable enough to make impor- 
tant observations. On a second voyage he prob- 
ably proceeded past the present site of Yuma, 
Ariz, A map drawn by one of Alarcbn's pilots is 
the earliest accurately detailed representation of 
the gulf and the lower course of the river. 
ALARCON, Pedro Antonio de (1833-91), 
Spanish writer and politician, born in Guadix, 
and educated in Jesuit schools After a brief pe- 
riod of military service he entered the national 
legislature, called the Cortes, as deputy for his 
native town and worked for the restoration of 
the constitutional monarchy. In 1875, after the 
monarchy was restored, Alfonso XII (see under 
Alfonso), King of Spain, made Alarcbn a coun- 
cilor. Alarcbn was noted in his own time for his 
religious novels El Escindalo (1875; Eng. trans, 
The Scandal, 1945) and La Prodiga ("The Prodi- 
gal", 1882); the former, a defense of the Jesuits, 
caused widespread public discussion. He is now 
chiefly remembered, however, for his stones 
and sketches of rustic Spanish life and manners, 
the most important of which are collected m El 
Sombrero de Tres Picos (1874; Eng. trans., The 
Three-Cornered Hat, 1891) and El Niho de la 
Ba/a(1880; Eng. trans., The Infant with the Globe, 
1955). 

ALARCON Y MENDOZA, Juan Ruiz de 

(about 1581-1639), Spanish dramatist of the 
Golden Age, born in Mexico. He studied law in 
Spain, and in 1626 became a member of the 
Council of the Indies, the governing body for 
the Spanish colonies. He wrote about twenty 
plays; however, his main contribution to Span- 
ish literature was the so-called comedies of eth- 
ics, plays with a moral purpose. He demon- 
strated how lying and slander bring disaster to

ALARIC, name of two kings of the Visigoths. 
See Goths Visigoths. 

Alaric I (about 370-410), King of the Visigoths 
(395-410), born on an island m the delta ot the 
Danube R. During his youth the Visigoths mi-* 
grated westward, under attack from the Huns 
(q.v.) at their rear. The Visigoths were used as 
auxiliary mercenary troops by the Roman em» 
peror Theodosius 1 (q.v.), and Alaric first ap- 
pears in history m 394 as a leader of these 
troops. Upon the death of Theodosius m 395 the 
Visigoths renounced their allc'giance to Rome 
and acknowledged Alanc as king. He led his 
troops into Greece, sacked Corinth, Argos, and 
Sparta, and spared Athens only in return for a 
heavy ransom. After being defeated by the 
Roman general Flavius Stihcho (q.v.), Alant re- 
tired with his plunder and secured from the 
new Eastern Roman emperor, Arcadius (177?- 
408), a commission as prefect of the Roman 
province of lllyricum In 402 Alaric invaded 
but was again defeated by Stilicho. Subse 
quently Alaric was persuaded to jom forces with 
the Western Roman emperor Honorius {3B4- 
423), who was convinced that war with the East 
ern Empire was inevitable. 

When Arcadius died in 408 Rome abandoned 
its projected move against the East, whereupon 
Alanc demanded 4000 lb. of gold as indemnity. 
On the insistence of Stilicho, the Roman gov 
ernment agreed to this demand, but soon 
thereafter Hononus had Stilicho executed on 
charges of treason and abrogated the agree- 
ment, Alaric then Invaded Italy, besieged Rome, 
and exacted a vast ransom. In 410 his troops 
captured and sacked the city A disastrous storm 
forced Alaric to abandon his next campaign, an 
invasion of Sicily and North Africa. 

Alaric II (d, 507), King of the Visigoths (484- 
507), succeeding his father Eun'r (d. 484), He 
ruled all Gaul beyond the Loire and Rh6ne riv- 
ers, and most of Spain. Alaric believed in the 
philosophy of Arianism (see Arius); his heresy 
gave the Frankish king, Clovis I (q.v,), who was 
an orthodox Christian, an excuse for making war 
on him. The forces of Alaric were completely 
routed near Poitiers, and he himself was over- 
taken and slain by Clovis. This defeat brought to 
an end the rule of the Visigoths m Gaul. Alaric is 
also known for the Breviary of Mark (q.v.J, an

Bristol and Kuskokwim bays, and Norton and 
Kotzebue sounds, between which lies the Sew- 
ard Peninsula (q.v.). Cape Prince of Wales, at the 
tip of the Seward Peninsula, is the westernmost 
point in North America. 

Geographically, Alaska is usually divided into 
six regions, as follows. (1) Northern Alaska, lying 
within the Arctic Region, is dominated by the 
Brooks Range, a part of the Rocky Mts. system. 
North of the mountains the terrain declines into 
the arctic slope, a region of frozen tundra (qw.). 
(2) Western Alaska, in the area of the deep 
sounds and bays, is principally tundra, broken 
by many hills. The St Lawrence, Nunivak, and 
Pribilof islands fie off the w, coast. (3) South- 
central Alaska is roughly bounded by the Alaska 
Range in the n., Cook Inlet in the w., and the 
Panhandle in the L In the Alaska Range are Mt. 
McKinley (20,320 ft.), the highest peak in North 
America (see McKiNifiV, Mount), and Mt. For- 
aker (17,395 ft.). In the t part of the region are 
the Chugach and Wrangell mountains. The latter 
are marked by three high peaks, Mt. Bona 


An active volcano in the Katmai National Monument, 
in southern Alaska, Shelly Qiro«*man-Wooclfin Camp & Aaaociates 

Alaska Peninsula, is the volcanic Mt Katmai, 
which has one of the largest craters in the world. 
Adjoining it is the Valley of Ten Thousand 
Smokes, about 17 mi. long and 4 mi wide, so 
named because of the innumerable steam vents 
with which it IS dotted. (5) Southeastern Alaska 
encompasses the Panhandle, including the is- 
lands of the Alexander Archipelago. Its border 
with Canada Is marked by the Coast Range, with 
elevations up to 15,000 ft. (6) Interior Alaska, 
lying between the Brooks Range and the Alaska 
Range, forms the drainage basin of the Yukon 
River (q v.), the largest river of the State. A 
deeply dissected and eroded plateau, it consists 
mainly of rolling uplands. 

Glaciers, which are numerous on the seaward 
slopes of the coastal ranges, are a prominent 
feature of Alaskan topography. Notable among 
them are Malaspina Glacier, about 1500 sq.mi. in 
area, and Muir Glacier, about 350 sq.mi., both m 
the St. Elias Range. See Glacier Bay National 


(16,421 ft.), Mt. Sanford (16,208 ft.), and Mt, Monument. 

Blackburn (16,523 ft.), and by Mt. Wrangell Rivers and Lakes* The Yukon R and its tribu- 


(14,006 ft,), the highest active volcano in Alaska. 
Separating the south-central region from the 
Panhandle Is part of the Saint Elias Range, domi- 
nated by Mt. St. Elias (18,008 ft.); to the w. the 
Kenai Mts. run the length of the Kenai Peninsu- 
la. (4) Southwestern Alaska comprises the Alaska 
Peninsula, with the Aleutian Range running 
down its s. side, the Aleutian Islands, and Kodi- 
ak and Afognak islands in the Gulf of Alaska. In 
the Aleutian Range, near the n. end of the 


tanes, including the Porcupine, Tanana, and 
Koyukuk rivers, form the major watercourse of 
Alaska, flowing across the State from e. to w, and 
emptying into the Bering Sea. The Kuskokwim 
R. empties into Kuskokwim Bay; the Colville and 
Noatak rivers drain into the Arctic Ocean; and 
the Susitna, Matanuska, and Copper rivers, flow 
into arms of the Pacific Ocean. The largest lake 
is lliamna, n. of the Alaska Peninsula. To the n. 
of lliamna is Clark lake, and to the $. are Nak-

nek, Becharof, and Ugashik lakes On the Kenai 
Peninsula are Tustumena, Skilak, and Kenat

Climate. Alaska may be divided into four ma- 
jor climatic zones. (1) the region of maritime 
influences, (2) the region of transition from 
maritime to continental influences; (3) the re- 
gion of continental climate; and (4) the region 
of arctic influence. 

The region of maritime influences comprises 
the islands and coastline of the S.L, the coast of 
the Gulf of Alaska, the offshore islands, and the 
Aleutian chain Characteristic climatic features 
are small temperature variations, high humid- 
ities, frequent fog, and abundant precipitation 
Summers are cool and winters mild, and the o< - 
casional extremes of temperature are localized 
and brief. The region has frequent strong but 
very localized winds, readings of 70 to 90 m.p.h 
occurring occasionally during the winter. Pre- 
cipitation IS abundant, occurring as ram in sum- 
mer and frequently even in winter; however, a 
permanent snow cover accumulates during the 
winter, to varying depths depending on occa- 
sional periods of above-freezing temperatures. 

In the transition region, comprising a bell ex- 
tending across and including the Copper R., 
Cook Inlet, Bristol Bay, and the west-central pan 
of the State, temperature variations become 
more pronounced, and humidity and precipita- 
tion decline Temperatures range from 40® F. to 
70® F. in summer and from -40® F. to 10® F. m 
winter Precipitation varies depending on the 
presence or absence of sheltering mountains, 
but the entire region receives a generally perma- 
nent snow cover during the winter months. The 
permafrost (q.v ) area of peref^ntally frozen 
ground extends southward well into the transi- 
tion region. 

The region of continental influence is af- 
fected by two climatic factors, the distance from 
the ocean and the surrounding topographic bar- 
riers that prevent the inland movement of mari- 
time air The record high and low temperatures 
for the State were both recorded in this region:

reindeer were imported to Alaska at the turn of 
the century by the U S. government. Herds are 
the exclusive property of the native residents. 
Of marine mammals, the most important is the 
fur seal of the Pribtlof Islands. Early in the 20th 
century the species was threatened with extinc- 
tion by commercial hunters* Stringent protective 
measures were adopted by the U.S. government 
in 1910, and the open-sea killing of seals was 
prohibited in the following year by an agree- 
ment among the U.S., Great Britain (for Can- 
ada), Russia, and Japan {see B£Ring Sea Contro- 
versy; Seal). The sea otter is another valuable 
species that has responded favorably to protec- 
tion, Other varieties of marine animals found in 
Alaskan waters are whales, porpoises, sea lions, 
and walruses. Numerous species of fish, includ- 
ing cod and halibut, occur in coastal waters, and 
the streams abound with salmon and trout. 
Three species of ptarmigan are widespread in 
Alaska, and waterfowl and many other species 
of bird are abundant in summer,

Sports. Alaska offers a wide variety of fishing. 
The many rivers and lakes contain trout, salmon, 
grayling, whiteftsh, and pike, and the coastal 
waters provide salmon and halibut Big-game 
animals hunted in the State include black, 
brown, grizzly, and polar bears, mountain 
sheep, mountain goats, moose, and caribou. 
Small game is also plentiful. Skiing begins m 
October and lasts until May; resorts include Al- 
yeska and Arctic Valley, near Anchorage, and 
Cleary Summit, near Fairbanks. The St. Elias, 
Wrangell, and Alaska ranges all have majestic 
mountains of interest to climbers. 

THE PEOPLE 

According to the results of the 1970 decennial 
census, the population of Alaska was 302,173, an 
increase of 33.6 percent over the 1960 popula- 
tion. The urban segment comprised 145,512 per-

sons (48 4 percent of the total), compared with 
37.9 percent In I960- The rural segment com- 
prised 154,870 (51 6 percent of the total), com- 
pared with 62,1 percent in 1960, Ethnically, the 
1970 population was distributed as follows, 
white persons, 236,767, nonwhites, 63,615, in- 
cluding 16,276 Indians, 8911 Negroes, and a few 
Filipinos, Japanese, Chinese, and others. In 1960 
there were more than 28,000 Eskimos and Aleuts 
The percentage of American-born residents in 
1970 was 97,4; of foreign-born, 2.6, The major 
countries of origin of the foreign-born were 
Canada, Germany, and Great Britain. The 1970 
population density averaged 0.5 per sq.mi., 
compared with 0.4 in 1960. 

The chief cities are Juneau, the capital and 
third-largest city, a seaport and airline hub and a 
commercial fishing center; Anchorage, the larg- 
est city; a center of air and rail transportation 
and trade, and Fairbanks, the second-largest 
city, a distribution center for agricultural and 
mining products, and the site of the University 
of Alaska

macoNOMY 

Alaska has a diversified economy. The per capita 
personal income m 1976 was $10,178, the high- 





est in the U.S., compared with S6441 for the 
country as a whole. Agri( ulturai employment is 
negligible. Nonagnt ulturai workers are em- 
ployed, in descending order of numbers, in gov- 
ernment, construction, servic.e industries, 
wholesale and retail trade, transportation and 
public utilities, manufacturing, and fina^cc^ real 
estate, and insurance. Tourism is a major con- 
tributor to the economy. In recent years, con- 
struction and operation of the first oil pipeline 
have increased employment and also the State's 
population— the latter by four times the rate in 
the U.S. as a whole. 

Manufacturifig* According to a recent survey 
of manufactures, production workers in Alaska 
m the mid-l970's totaled 6300. The largest 
groups were f*mploy«^d in food processing, in 
lumber and wood products, and in stone, clay, 
and glass products. The two largest manufactur- 
ing centers were* Anchorage, with about one 
fifth of the workers, and Fairbanks. The value 
added by manufacture (see Vaiui) totaled 
$101,300,000 for lumber and wood products, 
$91,500,000 for food processing, and $17,600,000, 
for printing and publishing. The value added by 
all manufacture in Alaska m the mid-1970's was 
about $449,200, eXX) annually. 

Agrictilture. Agriculture is relatively unimpor- 
tant in Alaska, which imports about 90 percent 
of its food. The most important commodities 
produced m the State are dairy products, hay, 
and potatoes. More than half of Alaska's farm

products are grown in the Matanuska Valley 
north of Anchorage. There were about 300 farms 
In Alaska m the mid-1970's, covering some 
1,710,000 acres. The average size of a farm was 
5700 acres. Total cash receipts from agriculture 
were about $9,000,000 annually, of which 
$5,000,000 came from livestock and $4,000,000 
from crops. 

Fishing. Alaska, one of the Pacific Coast States, 
has excellent fisheries that provide crab, floun- 
der, halibut, herring, mackerel, salmon, shrimp, 
and tuna Although ranking fourth m total catch, 
Alaska is the leading State in value of commer- 
cial fishing. In the mid-1970's, the catch 
amounted to about 34,132,000 lb. annually, with 
a value of $145,220,000. 

Mining. Petroleum is Alaska's most important 
mineral product Production of oil from the 
Prudhoe Bay oil field began in 1977, and the first 
oil was delivered through the Trans-Alaska pipe- 
line that summer. Estimated recoverable reserves 
of petroleum at Prudhoe Bay are about 10 bil- 
lion bbl; m addition, the field contains an esti- 
mated 24.5 billion cu.ft. of natural gas. The U S. 
and Canada agreed in 1977 to construct a natu- 
ral gas pipeline from Prudhoe Bay across Canada 
to Alberta, where it would connect with existing 
pipelines to the U.S. Structural materials such as 
stone, cement, and gravel are other important

mmerals. The value of mineral production m 
Alaska In the mld-1970\ before the pipeline 
opened, was about $481,000,000 annually. 
Energy. Electric energy produced in Alaska 
amounted to some 2.8 billion kw hour anrtyally 
m the mid-1 970's Both production and capacity 
were rising steadily. Only 3,2 percent of produc » 
tion and 4.7 percent of capacity were privately 
owned. 

forestry* The forest land of Alaska, mostly un- 
der Federal control, consists primarily of soft- 
woods, The commercial land, about 5 percent of 
the forest area, comprises some 5,640,000 acres. 
It produces a net annual cut of sawtimber of 
some 1,000,000,000 bdJt 
Tourism. Alaska is visited each year by some 
150,000 tourists, who spend some 530,000,000, 
The cities most visited are Anchorage, Fairbanks, 
and juneau. 

Transportation* The first railroad In Alaska

was the White Pass ^ Yukon Railway, opened 
iuly21,1898 There are about 670 mi of track m 
the State. There are about 4f>tX) mi. of rural and 
municipal roads and stjrne mi. of Federally 
assisted primary' and secondary mads Small air- 
planes are by far the most important means of 
transport In the mid-1970\ Alaska was served 
by 11 international and 10 kxal and interstate 
airlines; there were about publx and 223 
private airports Anchorage and Ketchikan are 
the leading ports

Evidence exists, m the form of old maps, that the 
coast of presenMiay Alaska was know^n to ex- 
plorers as early as 1S79, Systematic exploration 
of the region did noi however, until 1741. 
In that year an expedition under the command 
of the Russian-employerl Danish navigator Vitus 
Bering |c| v | reached the mamlancJ, in the vicin- 
ily of modern Sitka, and ciisccjvered many of the 
off-lying islands in 1781 the Russians estab- 
lished i setflemeni cm Kodiak Island. A large 
section of the loasl had been surveyed, mean- 
while, by the British navigator James Cook {q.v,). 



Other British e*xpiorer\ notably George Vancou- 
ver and Alexander Mackenzie (cjq.v,), made Im- 
portant dfscovenes rn the region. In 17^^) a Rus- 
sian fur-trading organization, the Russian- 
Amencan Company, ohtainiKi by royal charter a 
monopoly, extemiing as tar south as SS® N. lat., 
over the natural resources of the region then 
called Russian America. 1he company was man- 
aged by the Russian fur trader Aleksandr Andrc^- 
yevKh Baranov (1747-1819), Under his leader- 
ship the company founded a number of 
settlements, including New Archangel (1799), 
later known as Sitka, and maintained its primary 
interest, the fur tracie. In 182S, following a juris- 
dictional dispute, the Russian and British gov- 
ernments concluded an agreement on the 
boundaries of Russian America. The royal char- 
ter of the Russian-American Company was al- 
lowed to lapse m {)ec ember, 1861, and during 
the next few years Russian America was admin- 
istered by an imperial governor. 

The U*S. Acquires Alaska. After the close of 
the American Civil War the United States gov- 
ernment, under pressure from influential west- 
coast fishing interests, began to negotiate with 
the Russian government for the purchase of 
Russian America. I he negotiations were brought 
to a successful conclusion on March K), 1867, by 
William Henry Seward (q.v.), U.S. Secretary of 
State, Under the terms of a treaty signed on that 
date by the two governments, Russian America 
was ceded to the U5. in exchange for $7,200,- 
000, Many American politicians and journalists 
critiied the purchase, dubbing it ^'Seward's Foi-

alakshak or alayeksa (''a great country") Cere- 
monies marking the transfer of Alaska to the 
U.S. were held at Sitka on Oct. 18, 1867 
The Congress of the ' ^ed States failed to 
provide Alaska with a civil government until 
1884. During the intervening period the posses- 
sion was governed successively by the United 
States Army, a customs collector, and the United 
States Navy. Although American settlers in 
Alaska had petitioned Congress to establish the 
possession as a Territory, the enactment of 1884 
made it a District, The legislation contained 
many shortcomings, such as the failure to pro- 
vide for a strong executive, representative gov- 
ernment, and powers of taxation Attempts to 
secure modifications from Congress proved 
fruitless until after the discovery (August, 18%) 
of gold in the Klondike of Canada and, subse- 
quently, in the Yukon R, valley m Alaska Begin- 
ning in 1898, Congress adopted a series of bills 
designed to remedy various evils in the District 
Popular demands for a Territorial form of gov- 
ernment were ignored, however, until 1912, 
when the Organic Act approved the establish- 
ment of Alaska as a Territory. Meanwhile, at- 
tempts by certain American corporate interests 
to acquire control of natural resources in Alaska 
had precipitated violent controversies m District 
and national political circles. Evidence of gov-

ernmental collusion and fraud was uncovered m 
subsequent investigations, with the result that 
far-reaching Alaskan conservation measures to 
protect the Territory's resources were ultimately 
promulgated (see Pinchot, Gifford). 

Economic and social conditions improved 
steadily m Alaska during its first quarter century 
as a Territory. Measures were taken to better the 
lot of the aborigines. The fishing-canning mdus* 
try flourished. In 1923 the Fairbanks-Seward rati- 
way was completed. Although copper produi • 
tion, formerly a major source of wealth, 
dropped alarmingly after 1926, gold production 
increased, especially after 1933. The Federal gov- 
ernment initiated an extensive program of de- 
fense construction in the Territory following the 
outbreak of World War tl. This program was 
enormously expanded after the Japanese attack 
on Pearl Harbor m 1941. Huge military, naval, 
and air bases were established in many parts of 
the Territory, and work on the Alaska Highway 
(q.v.) was accelerated. In June, 1942, Japanese 
forces occupied Kiska and Attu, the most west- 
erly of the Aleutian Islands. The invaders were 
expelled by an American-Canadian task force m 
August, 1943. 

The strategic importance of Alaska in national 
defense planning became increasingly apparent 


in the postwar |M»riod Varunis military estab- 
lishments in th<‘ l«*rriiofv were kept m opi^ration 
after the close ol hostilities, and in subsequent 
years several new* air bases were built. The 
United Stales House of Representatives had 
meanwhile apprcweti legislation making 

Alaska the fortv^ninth fiiate of the Union. This 
measure, whiih had imm previcwsly endorsed 
by the Alaskan ehniorate, tailed to receive the 
approval of the Unifwl States 5Wma!e. In 19S0lhe

duced m the Congress early in 1955 and was 
rejected by ihe Houm* on May 10. On Nov. S, 
195$, a conslilytionai convention met to draft a 
constitytion lor the proposeeJ State of Alaska. 
The convemion also adopted an orclmance pro- 
viding for Ihe immediate election of two Sena- 
tors and one Represeniaiive to represent Alaska

in the United States Congress. The draft consti- 
tution was approved by Alaskan voters on April 
24, 1956, but no action was taken by Congress to 
admit Alaska as a State 

In early 1958 President Dwight D. Eisenhower 
(q V.) urged passage of an Alaskan-Statehood 
bill Such legislation was passed m the House on 
May 15 by a vote of 318 to 51, approved by the 
Senate on June 30 by a vote of 64 to 20, and 
signed by President Eisenhower on July 8, 1958 
In a special election held on Aug. 26, 1958, Alas- 
kans voted their approval of Statehood by a 
margin of five to one. In another election, on 
Nov 25, 1958, Democrats won the major Alas- 
kan political offices, including two U S, Senate 
seats, one seat m the House, and the governor- 
ship On Jan. 3, 1959, President Eisenhower 
signed a proclamation granting Alaska State- 
hood, making it the first new State since 1912 

At first, Statehood proved economically bur- 
densome, as Alaska had to assume public ser- 
vice expenditures formerly borne by the Federal 
government. Further hardship arose when the 
most powerful earthquake ever recorded m 
North America struck Alaska in March, 1964, 
causing about 120 deaths and $1 billion in dam- 
age. 

The 1968 discovery of vast petroleum and 
natural gas deposits on northern Alaska's North 
Slope, a region between the Brooks Range and 
the Arctic Ocean, at last promised economic re- 
lief During 1975-77, an SOO-mL oil pipeline was 
built from Prudhoe Bay, an arm of the Arctic 
Ocean, to Valdez, a port on the Pacific Ocean. 
Large-scale oil production began in late 1977, 
with the prospect of annual oil revenues reach- 
ing hundreds of millions of dollars. 

But since Alaska contains America's only im- 
portant Arctic wilderness, efforts are under way 
to reconcile the State's new economic, social, 
and political realities with the need to preserve 
environmental integrity through the judicious 
application of land-use management. 

ALASKA HIGHWAY^ section of the Pan 
American Highway (q.v.) that links Dawson 
Creek, British Columbia, Canada, with Fair- 
banks, Alaska, by way of Whitehorse, Yukon 
Territory. In the S. the highway joins a road that 
serves Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, and in the n. 
it is joined by highways that serve Valdez and 
Anchorage, Alaska. The Alaska Highway is 1527 
mi. long, and extends in a generally n.w. direc- 
tion along the L edge of the Rocky Mts. across 
extremely rough terrain. Construction was be- 
gun shortly after the United States entered 
World War H to provide an overland supply 
route to the U.S. armed forces in Alaska. The 


highway was completed between March and 
October, 1942, at a cost of $139,000,000 It was 
maintained by the U S as a military road until 
1946, when the Canadian section (1221 mi ) was 
turned over to the Canadian government for 
maintenance In 1948 the highway was opened 
to civilian travel. Known as the Alcan Highway 
until 1945, the Alaska Highway has an all- 
weather surface (gravel in Canada; paved in 
Alaska) and is open to traffic the year around. 
Travel conditions vary according to weather and 
season, however Snow and sub-zero tempera- 
tures often block the road in winter, and spring 
floods frequently cause damage to the many 
bridges along the route Gasoline stations, 
sleeping accommodations, roadside facilities, 
and telephone and telegraph service are avail- 
able at regular intervals along the entire route 
ALASKA RANGE, one of the principal moun- 
tain ranges in the State of Alaska It extends in a 
generally n l direction from the base of the 
Alaska Peninsula to the frontier of Yukon Terri- 
tory, Canada. The range averages about 50 mi in 
width; it forms the parting between the Pacific 
drainage basin of Alaska, on the s , and the Ber- 
ing Sea drainage basin, on the n and w ; the 
highest peak is Mt. McKinley (20,320 ft.)

on the Mure§ R , about 110 miles f of Arad The 
city consists of an upper town, or citadel, con- 
structed by Charles VI (q.v.), Holy Roman Em- 
peror, between 1716 and 1735; and a lower 
town, which contains a noted cathedral and the 
Batthyaneum, a museum founded in 1794. Con- 
structed in the 11th century, the cathedral was 
rebuilt in the 15th century in the Gothic style. A 
library, an observatory, and a museum are m the 
Batthyaneum. Alba lulia occupies the site of the 
Roman colony Apulum, and many Roman relics 
are in the museum The tomb of the Hungarian 
patriot J4nos Hunyadi (q.v,) is in Alba lulia. Pop.

ALBA LONGA, one of the oldest cities of 
Italy, in ancient latium. According to Roman 
legend, it was founded by Ascanius, son of the 
Trojan hero Aeneas (q.v.) The city was long the 
head of the ancient confederacy known as the 
Latin League, but was destroyed by the Romans 
under TuKus Hostilius (673-441 bc), the legend- 
ary third king of Rome, and was never rebuilt. 
Alba Longa was located on a rocky ridge above 
Lake Albano. Scholars disagree as to whether it 
was located on the e. or w. shore of the fake; the 
latter site seems more likely, for an ancient ne- 
cropolis containing tombs built about 1100 bc 
was found there,

Christian some time during the late 3rd or early 
4th century. The feast day of Saint Alban is June

ALBANIA (Albanian Shqipal, "'Eagle's Coun- 
try"'), nation of Europe in the w part of the Bal- 
kan Peninsula, bounded on the n w, n., and e. by 
Yugoslavia; on the Si, and s by Greece; and on 
the w, by the Adriatic Sea. Albania lies between 
lat. 39*^38' N. and lat, 42Mr n. and long, 19^16' i 
and long. 21*^03' e. The smallest of the Balkan 
countries, Albania has a maximum length from 
N to s. of about 215 mi. and a maximum width of 


about 90 mi The total area of the country is 
11,(Y>h sq mi. 

THE lAND 

Albania is mostly mountainous, but the terrain is 
broken bv a wide belt of coastal lowlands 
backed bv rugged uplands One of the principal 
mountain ranges is the North Albanian Alps, a 
continuation ot the Dinaru Alps of Yugoslavia 
Many moimtams in Albania rise abruptly from 
the lowlands to above 8(XX1 ft fhe highest ele- 
vation in the < ountry is Korab Ml, (^1068 ft.). In 
central and sf Albania the mountains are inter- 
spersed with high plateaus and basins. The Al- 
banian lowlands consist ot plains interrupted by 
hilly ridges. 

The rivers of Albania usuallv rise at a high alti-

tude in the interior and descend swiftly to the 
coastal plain through steep gorges. The longest 
river of Albania is the Drm Other important riv- 
ers are the Shkumbt, Semeni, Arzen, Mati, and 
the Vijose. The Bojana, the only navigable river 
of Albania, marks part of the border with Yugo- 
slavia. Three large lakes he on the borders of the 
country: Lake Scutari in the nw , and Lake Ohrid 
and Lake Prespa m the st 
Climate. Albania lies m two climatic zones. 
Along the coast the climate is typically Mediter- 
ranean, with mild, humid winters and dry sum- 
mers, The uplands have a more northerly cli- 
mate, with marked seasonal extremes m 
temperature. Winters are quite severe in the up- 
lands; the summers are hottest m the s.e. intra- 
montane basins The heaviest precipitation is in 
the mountains, with as much as ICX) in, a year in 
the N. uplands. The central and n, sections of the 
coastal strip average about 40 in. of rainfall a 
year, most of which occurs during the winter. 
Droughts are common m the s. lowlands. 
Natural Resources* Albanian resources are 
mainly agricultural. Mineral resources have be- 
come increasingly important since exploitation 
began m 1945. 

Plants and Animals. The native plant life of 
the Albanian coast consists chiefly of thickets of 
bushes and dwarf trees, much of which has 
been cleared for cultivation, Forests cover about 


INDEX TO MAP Of ALBANIA 






45 percent of the land Among the most com- 
mon trees are oak, elm, pine, and birch. The 
eagle (for which Albania Is named) is still fairly 
common m the mountain recesses. Wolves, 
bears, boars, deer, and wildfowl abound. 

Soils. The lowlands of Albania are mainly allu- 
vial and therefore are quite fertile, but their util- 
ity IS lessened by many swamps and lagoons 
The soils deposited along the large lakes and 
numerous rivers are more productive. Two 
thirds of the area of the country is made up of 
vast stretches of unproductive badlands that are 
characterized by eroded surfaces of porous 
limestone and scant vegetation 
Waterpower. A great potential capacity for 
the production of cheap hydroelectric power 
exists in Albania because of the many torrential 
streams and waterfalls. In 1971 six hydroelectric 
plants were In operation: the Lenin plant near 
Tiran§, the Karl Marx plant on the Mati R,, the 
Friedrich Engels plant at Shkopeti, two plants at 
Brstritca, and the most recent, opened at Fier In 
1968. The total power production in the mid- 
1960's averaged annually about 341,000,000 kw 
hours. 

THE PEOPLE 

The Albanians are believed to be descendants 
of the Thracians and ancient Illyrians. Most of 
the people today are divided Into two branches, 
the Ghegs and the Tosks. The Cheg branch lives 
N. of the ShkumbT R., and the Tosk branch lives s. 
of the ShkumbT R., in the Albanian sector of Epi- 
rus. The principal minority group consists of 
about 20,000 to 30,000 Greeks living in the 
Gjinokast^r region adjacent to Greece. Other 
scattered minorities Include the Vlachs, Gypsies, 
Montenegrin Serbs, and Bulgars. Many Albani- 
ans continue to live in tribal organizations; the 
mountain-dwelling Malissores are the best- 
known group. 

Population. Albania is the most sparsely pop- 
ulated of the E. European countries. The popula- 
tion of Albania (census 1960) was 1,626,315; the 
United Nations estimated (1970) 2,168,000. The 
overall population density is about 187 per sq. 
mi, (U.N. est. 1%9), 

Political Divisions and Principal Cities. Al- 
bania is divided into 27 districts, 198 localities, 
13 towns, and 1300 villages. Largest cities are the 
capital and chief city Tirana, with a population 
of 169,300 (1%7 est.); the nearby port of Durr^s, 
53,000; the ancient town of Shkoder, 50,000; and 
the seaport of Vlon§, 50,000. 

Religion. About 70 percent of the people are 
Muslims. Albania is the only European country 
in which a majority of the population is non- 
Christian. Muslim Albanians are affiliated with

themes began to develop An important writer 
during this period was )eronim de Rada 
(1813-1903), who wrote poetic epics based on 
the ancient folk songs and heroic folk tales he 
collected. Another writer of verse of national 
themes was Zef Schird (1865-1927) 

The leaders of the movement for liberation 
from Turkey fought both as writers and as active 
revolutionaries. In the front rank of these writers 
was Naim Frash§ri (1846-1900), who Is known 
for his version of the story of the Albanian na- 
tional hero Scanderbeg (q v ). 

After independence in 1912, poets of the 
Gheg north became prominent. An outstanding 
Gheg poet was Gjergj Fishta (1871-1941), who 
also excelled as a political writer and as an edi- 
tor Fan Stylian Noli (1881 -1%5) translated the 
works of William Shakespeare and other foreign 
authors into Albanian. Noli also edited an Alba- 
nian newspaper in Boston, Mass. Other leading 
20th-century literary figures include the symbol- 
ist poet Lasgush Poradeci, the playwright Kristo 
Floqj, and the novelist Foqion Postoli. 

THE ECONOMY 

Albania is considered the poorest and least de- 
veloped country in Europe. Under the Commu- 
nist regime national productivity has been in- 
creased by means of a series of five-year plans 


initiated in 1951 During the fifth such plan 
(1971-75) industrial production increased by 52 
percent and agricultural production by 33 per- 
cent The sixth five-year plan was initiated in 
1976. 

Virtually all of Albanian industry is national- 
ized under either the central government or or- 
gans of local government. About 90 percent of 
all farms have been collectivized The 1977 bud- 
get showed estimated revenues of about $1.78 
billion and expenditures of some $1 54 billion. 
Agriculture. Before Albania's liberation in 
1944, 87 percent of its population worked in ag- 
riculture; by the late 1970's about 65 percent 
were still so engaged Since 1960 Albania has 
increased its arable land by 45 percent Over 
sixty reservoirs were built during 1971-75, plac- 
ing 115,000 acres of land under irrigation. In 
1975 more than 34,000 acres of new land were 
opened for cultivation. The major crops (with 
estimates of 1976 production) include wheat 
and spelt (390,000 metric tons), maize (280,000), 
sugar beets (140,000), potatoes (122,000), grapes 
(69,000), rice (18,000), and tobacco (14,000) 

Animal husbandry forms a large part of the 
Albanian economy. In 1976 the livestock popu-

iation included 1,163,000 sheep, 470,000 cattle, 
117,000 pigs, 52,000 asses, and 42,000 horses 
Sheep and goats provide hides, wool, mohair, 
milk, cheese, and meat. Egg production reached 
4400 metric tons m 1976 
Forest and Fishing Industries. Timberlands 
cover about 30 percent of the forested areas and 
constitute an important natural resource of the 
country. The output of wood for fuel or for con- 
version into lumber, veneer, or other products 
was 1,%2,000 cu.yd in 1975 Fish are plentiful 
off the Adriatic coast and m the takes and rivers. 
The fishing industry is managed by the state and 
cooperatives; the annual catch averages some 
3000 tons. 

Mining. Petroleum is the chief mineral wealth 
of Albania, in the mid-1970's the annual output 
of crude petroleum was 2,300,000 metric tons 
Major oil fields are at Qyet^ Stalin, Patos, Pe- 
kishte, and Selenice. Albania is also rich in chro- 
mium and copper, producing some 320,000 met 
ric tons of chromium ore and 7000 metric tons 
of copper annually. Other minerals include lig- 
nite, limestone, asphalt, rock salt, bauxite, and 
pyrites 

Manufacturing. Prior to 1925 practically no 
industry existed in Albania. By 19^ light mdus 
try was operating on a small scale, manufactures 
included soap, beer, textiles, cement, and con 
sumer goods. Since the initiation of the five-year 
plans, greater emphasis has been placed on the 
development of industry. In the late 1960\ with 
Communist Chinese assistance, chemical engi- 
neering plants were built to produce cement, 
fertilizer, and paper. Other new plants include a 
copper smelter, a textile combine, several cotton 
gins, and sugar and oil refineries. In the mici* 
1970's, some of the principal manufactures were 
cement (517, OCX) metric tons), petroleum prod- 
ucts including asphalt (1.8 billion metric tons), 
and wine (4, 225, OCX) gal.). 

Currency and Banking. The monetary unit of 
Albania is the new lek, introduced m 1965 {4 
leks equal U S.$1; 1977). The Bank of the Alba- 
nian State was organized in 1945 and is the sole 
issuing bank; it controls all foreign transactions 
and aids in the preparation of financial plans for 
the economy. All banking and credit institutions 
in the country are nationalized. 

Commerce and Trade. Trade relations are al- 
most entirely with the Communist countries, 
particularly the People^^s Republic of China. The 
principal imports are Industrial machinery and 
raw materials, vehicles, and consumer goods. 
Exports include crude oft, pig copper, chrome 
ore, tobacco, wine, fruits, and vegetables. In the 
mid-1960% according to the latest available sta-

histone times (See also Illyria) Some Greek 
colonies were founded along the coast. 

(Ilynan pirate ships were a danger to Roman 
trade In 168 B c, during the Third Macedonian 
War, Rome conquered the kingdom ot illyrta 
and divided it into three dependent confed- 
eracies. The Romans also seized Epirus m south- 
ern Albania The country later passed to the Byz- 
antine (Eastern Roman) Empire, which 
partitioned it into the provinces of Dyrrachium 
and Nicopohs. 

The Ostrogoths held the country during the 
4th and 5th centuries a.D., but in 535 Emperor 
Justinian 1 (qv) reconquered it for the Byzan- 
tine Empire. The land was later invaded by the 
Slavs and Bulgars; the Bulgars still held part of 
the country in the 9th century. Foreign rule nev- 
er became fully entrenched in the interior, how- 
ever, and some of the fierce mountain tribes 
continued to live in virtual independence. From 
1014 to 1204 southern Albania was again under 
Byzantine rule. 

The kings of Sicily ruled central Albania from 
1271 to 1368, during which the Serbs made in- 
roads from the north. Under the Serbian ruler 
Stephen Dushan (1308?-55), a large part of Alba- 
nia was subdued by 1344, but the empire dism 
tegrated after the death of Dushan. During this 
time, Venetians had become firmly established 
on the Albanian coast, notably at Durres and 
Shkoder. The Venetians had enjoyed commer- 
cial privileges m these cities since the 11th cen- 
tury. 

Turkish Rule. In the mid-15th century, when 
the Ottoman Turks threatened to subjugate Al- 
bania, the native tribes rallied under the leader- 
ship of the patriot Scanderbeg (q.v.) and with- 
stood the Turks. After the death of Scandert>eg 
in 1468, however, the Ottomans soon gained the 
upper hand, even though their rule was never 
completely effective. During the period of Otto- 
man dominance a great many Albanians emi- 
grated to southern Italy and Sicily. The mafority 
of the population converted to Islam, and many 
Albanians distinguished themselves m the ser- 
vice of their Turkish rulers. In the 18th and early 
19th centuries independent native princes ruled 
the country for a brief period. One of the fore- 
most native lines was the Bushati dynasty 
(1760*1831) of northern Albania. Ali Pasha 
(1741-1822), a Turkish ruler, resisted Ottoman 
power in centra! Albania. During the 19th cen- 
tury the Albanians rose repeatedly m open re- 
bellion against the Turks.

In fanuary, 1920, an assembly of Albanian 
leaders established a provisional government 
(regency coum it) Upnsir^gs agamsi the Italidf^s 
subsequently m curred m many pans of Albania. 
In August Italy agreed m evacuate ds forces and 
lo recognize Albanian independence. The 
French had meanwhile (June, 1920) alMndoned 
the Kory# region fernionat disputes with 
Gfef*ce and Yugoslavia were adfudirared during 
the next lew years 

Ixecubve aythonty in Albania was exercised 
by the regency council unitl lanuary, 192S. In 
that month a National Assembly, dominated by 
Ahmed Sey Zogu |1§9S-1%1}, premier of the 
provisional government, abolished the regency 
council and proclaimed a repoblic, with Zogu as 
president The republic coniinoed uniii Aug. 25, 
1928, when a new constitytion proclaimed Aiba- 




nia a democratic, independent monarchy and 
Ahmed Zogu ascended the throne as Zog 1. On 
the domestic front a broad program of cultural 
and economic reforms was instituted by the 
new monarch. His foreign policy was character- 
ized by dose collaboration with Italy. Through 
financial subsidies, military missions, and other 
means, Italy soon attained a dominant position 
m Albanian affairs. 

Belated efforts by King Zog to halt Italian pen- 
etration of his coufttry brought quick reprisal 
Italy marched into Albania on April 7, 1939. Zog 
I was forced into exile, and King Victor Emman- 
uel til (see under Victor Emmanur) of Italy was 
proclaimed king of Albania a few days later. 
From bases of operation in Albania, Italian 
troops invaded Greece, which repelled them 
and, in turn, invaded Albania, German troops 
came to the assistance of the Italians and in 
April, 1941, compelled Greek forces in Albania 
to surrender (see GR£ECf : Modem Greece). Alba- 
nian guerrilla troops, steadily increasing in num- 
bers, operated against the Germans until No- 
vember, 1944. In that year, because of their 
worsening position on other fronts, the Ger- 
mans were forced to withdraw from the Balkans. 
The Albanian German -dominated government, 
which in December, 1941, had declared war on 
the U.S,, was deposed. 

The Confimuiitst Regfme* A provisional gov- 
ernment was formed by Premier Enver Hoxha 
(1908- ), commander in chief of the resistance

forces and head of the dominant, Communist- 
controlled National Liberation Front Party On 
Jan. 12, 1946, at Tirana, a new Constituent As- 
sembly, all seats of which had been gamed by 
Hoxha's party m a one-slate election, pro- 
claimed a new People's Republic of Albania. 
Hoxha, who resigned as head of the provisional 
government on Jan. 13, was then reinstated as 
prime minister and minister of foreign affairs of 
the constitutional government On Jan. 28 the 
United Nations Security Council rejected the Al- 
banian request for U N. membership, which had 
been sponsored by the U.S.S.R. and Yugoslavia 
With the formal adoption of the new consti- 
tution on March 14, 1946, the Albanian Con- 
stituent Assembly renamed itself the People's 
Forum of the People's Republic of Albania. Hox- 
ha again resigned, and was commissioned to 
form a new government. All officers of the new- 
ly formed government were Communists; Hox- 
ha became prime minister, minister of foreign 
affairs, and minister of defense. Albanian for- 
eign relations were characterized by close align- 
ment with the U.S.S.R. and by disputes 
with Great Britain and Greece. The mam 
sources of the quarrels with Greece were the 
latter's claim to a region in southern Albania 
(Gr., North Epirus) and its contention that Al- 
bania was arming anti-government Greek

ALBANIA 


forces In April, 1948, Albania refused the offer 
of the U N. Balkan Commission to mediate this 
dispute. 

Albania adopted a hostile attitude toward Yu- 
goslavia following the denunciation (June, 1948) 
of Yugoslav premier Tito (q.v.) by the Commu- 
nist Information Bureau (Cominform), an asso 
ciation of the Communist parties of Europe (see 
Yugoslavia History), On July 3, 1948, it severed 
trade relations with Yugoslavia, from which it 
had been importing most of its food. Yugoslav 
cultural, military, and economic missions were 
expelled from Albania, and wholesale arrests of 
pro-Tito Albanians were carried out 

Albania was receiving substantial economic 
aid from the U.S.S.R Before the end of 1950 sev- 
eral thousand Soviet technicians were at work 
on various Albanian projects, notably the con- 
struction of large naval installations near Vione. 
Political purges, arrests of alleged spies, and ex- 
ecutions dominated internal politics during the 
year, and relations with Yugoslavia and Greece 
remained tense throughout 1950 and 1951. 

Albania resumed diplomatic relations with 
Yugoslavia in December, 1953, and m February, 
1954, the two governments conciuded agree- 
ments providing for cessation of border inci- 
dents and for resumption of trade. Deputy Pre- 
mier Mehmet Shehu (1913- ) replaced Hoxha 
as premier in July, 1954, although Hoxha re- 
tained his position as head of the Communist 
Party. Late in 1954 Albania participated in a 
Moscow conference that drafted plans to estab- 
lish an eight-nation Communist-defense system 
in the event of the remilitarization of West Ger- 
many. The system was organized m May, 1955, 
shortly after the admission of West Germany to 
the North Atlantic Treaty and Brussels Treaty or- 
ganizations In 1955 Albania was admitted to the 
U N, in 1957 visitors from non-Communist 
countries were admitted to Albania for the first 
time since World War 11. 

Alliance with China. Beginning in 1959, Al- 
bania and Communist China drew closer to- 
gether During the November, 1960, conference 
of Communist parties in Moscow, the Albanian 
party was the only European party reported to 
have sided with Communist China m its conten- 
tion that world Communist domination could 
be achieved only through war. The stated Soviet 
view was that communism could be spread by 
peaceful persuasion and economic pressure. Al- 
bania was excluded from the next international 
Communist conference, held in Moscow m Oc- 
tober, 1%1, at which Albania was subjected to 
bitter denunciations that were interpreted 
widely as indirect attacks on Communist China.

tions with Albania. Albania signed aid and trade

Dutch fur traders established a blockhouse, 
called Fort Nassau, near the site of present-day 
Albany m 1614 but abandoned it in 1617. Colo- 
nization of the site began with the founding of 
Fort Orange in 1624; Beverwyck, the community 
that developed around the fort, thus became 
the second permanent settlement (after Plym- 
outh) in the region later comprising the thirteen 
colonies. In 1664, when Great Britain seized 
New Netherland from the Dutch, Beverwyck 
was renamed Albany in honor of the duke of 
York and Albany, later James II (q.v.), King of 
England. It was granted a t ity charter in 1686. In 
1754 it was the scene of the Albany Convention 
(q.v.). Albany became the State capital m 1797,

ALBANY REGENCY, popular name for a 
group of Democratic Party politicians whose ac- 
tivities were centered in Albany, N Y., and who 
took a leading part in national and New York 
State politics between 1820 and 1850 The Re- 
gency was one of the earliest effective political 
machines in the United States. Most of its mem- 
bers simultaneously held -public offices and 
party positions, using both to bolster their own 
private fortunes and those of their party. Among 
Its prominent members were Martin Van Buren 
(q v.), who rose from State office to the U.S 
Presidency, and William Marcy (q.v), who be- 
came governor of New York State and cabinet 
officer under Presidents James Knox Polk and 
Franklin Pierce (qq v.). A split m the New York 
Democratic Party after 1844 weakened the Re- 
gency, and It eventually was dissolved

ALBATROSS, common name applied to large 
seabirds of the family Diomedeidae in the order 
Procellaniformes, which includes also the petrel 
and the shearwater (qq.v.) The bill of the alba- 
tross IS characterized by a markedly hooked 
upper mandible with tubular nostrils protruding 
from the base. The feet are strongly webbed and 
lack a hind claw; the wings are long and narrow. 
Thirteen species of albatross can be found 
mainly throughout seas of the Southern Hemi- 
sphere, from the Antarctic region north to the 
tropics. 

Albatrosses are nomadic birds that spend 
months wandering great distances over the 
oceans. They sleep on the ocean surface, drink 
seawater, and feed on cuttlefish, other small 
marine animals, and refuse from ships. They re- 
turn to land only to breed, at which time they 
perform a stylized courting ritual of elaborate 
bowing and posturing. The albatross nests on 
barren islands, close to shore; the nest usually is 
a depression in the ground containing a single 
egg. When hatched, the nestling is covered with 
brownish down, and it grows to adulthood rela- 
tively slowly. 

The ability of some species to zigzag across a 
strong headwind has long fascinated manners. 
Albatrosses often follow a ship for days, diving 
steeply into the water to recover refuse from the 
wake of the ship. The birds are easily caught 
With baited hook and line; captured birds usu- 
ally are released, however, because of a super- 
stition commonly held by sailors that killing an 
albatross brings bad luck. The superstition forms 
the theme of The Rime of the Ancient Mariner

Well-known species include the wandering 
albatross, Diomedea exulans, a huge bird with a 
12-ft. wingspread. The plumage of this seabird is 
white with black wing tips, and there are pink 
or orange patches on the sides of the head. The 
Laysan albatross, D, immutabilis, is a smaller, 
brown-winged species with a sooty4)la<k spot 
near the eyes and a gray bill. Another smaller

ALBERT I (1875-1934), King of Belgium, 
nephew of Leopold II (see under iHwaio), King 
ot Belgium. He was born in Brussels and edu- 
cated privately and at the Fcole Militaire. Before 
his accession to the throne he bore the title 
Count of Flanders His democratic manner 
made him the most popular member of the 
reigning house He traveled widely and was a 
student of politics and economics In 1898 and 
again in 1919 he visited th(* United States Dur- 
ing 1900 he made an extended lour of the Bel- 
gian Congo and upon his return to Belgium 
urged the need of railroad development and of 
reform in the treatment of the Congolese; when 
he became king he ordered many improve- 
ments in the administration of this colony (see 
ZAiRf, RfPUBiic Of). On the death of leopold II in 
1909, Albert became king ot Belgium. 

Albert was the first luropean ruler to warn of 
the impending World War 1. During 1913, while 
visiting in Germany, he was informed of the 
plans for war by William II (q.v.), Kaist^r of Ger- 
many, He immediately warned France, and on 
July 31, 1914, sent a personal letter to the kaiser 
informing him that Belgium would remain neu- 
tral When the letter was ignored and German 
troops poured into Belgium, Albc^rt assumed ac- 
tive command of hts army and directed a suc- 
cessful delaying action against the invasion. He 
remained with his troops for the duration of the 
war. 

After World War I he played an active rote in 
the reconstruction of his country, and in 1919 
made a plea to the Allies for the abolition of the 
Treaty of tendon, which made Belgium neutral 
ground and thus vulnerable to invasion. The ap- 
peal was granted by the Allies, and the abolition 
of the treaty was incorporated mto the Treaty of 
Versailles (see Virsaiuis, TufAtv oi). Throughout 
the 192D's Albert supported general industrial 
expansion and the development of a strong 
merchant fleet as the best methods of national 
recovery* In 1934 he was killed by a fall while 
mountain climbing. He was succeeded by his 
eldest son as Leopold III (see under Liopoto). 
ALBERT^ name of two Holy Roman emper- 
ors. 

Albert I (1250?-1308), Holy Roman Emperor 
(12%-1308), Duke of Austria (1282-1308). He re- 
ceived the duchy of Austria in 1282 from his fa- 
ther, Rudolf I of Hapsburg (q.v.), King of Ger- 


many and Holy Roman Emperor. After Rudolfs 
death in 1291, the German Imperial Electors re- 
fused to recognize Albert's claims to the throne 
and named Adolf of Nassau (1250?-98) king of 
Germany With the help of a coalition of Ger- 
man princes, Albert deposed and succeeded 
Adolf in 1298 Pope Boniface VIII (see under 
Boniface) recognized him as Holy Roman Em- 
peror in 1303, but he was never crowned Dur- 
ing his reign he adopted measures beneficial to 
the serfs, Jews, and the mercantile class, ob- 
tained the crown of Bohemia for his son, and in 
1307 waged an unsuccessful war against Thurin- 
gia (q V.). He was murdered by a nephew whose 
inheritance he had withheld 
Albert II (1397-1439), Holy Roman Emperor 
(1438-39), and Duke of Austria as Albert V 
(1404“39) He inherited the duchy in 1404 and 
in 1437 succeeded his father-m-law, the Holy 
Roman Emperor Sigismund (q.v) as King of Bo- 
hemia and Hungary In 1438 he became king of 
Germany. Although recognized as Holy Roman 
Emperor, he was never crowned During Al- 
bert's brief reign, the Poles and Turks invaded 
Bohemia and Hungary, respectively 
ALBERT (1828-1902), King of Saxony (1873- 
1902). He was noted for his military ability At 
the age of twenty-one he served as captain in 
the army of the duchies of Schleswig and Hol- 
stein in their war against the Danes (see 
ScHUSWic-HotSTEiN). In 1866, during the Seven 
Weeks' War (q.v.) between Austria and Prussia, 
Albert commanded a Saxon corps which distin- 
guished Itself at the decisive battle of Kon- 
iggr^tz (now Hradec Kr^lov6, Czechoslovakia) 
by a firm stand against the Prussians In the 
Franco-German War (q.v.) of 1870-71, in which 
Saxony fought on the side of Prussia, Albert 
commanded the Saxon army which helped de- 
feat the French at Gravelotte, France. He was 
then placed in command of the so-called Fourth 
Army, which fought at Sedan, France, and took 
part in the siege of Pans, After the armistice, Al- 
bert commanded the German army that occu- 
pied France, and upon the declaration of peace 
he became an inspector general and field mar- 
shal of the German army. 

ALBERT HI (1414-86), Elector of Brandenburg 
(1470--66), born in Tangermunde. He was nick- 
named Achilles or Ulysses, because his extraor- 
dinarily shrewd mind and unusual physical 
strength gave him m contemporary eyes a re- 
semblance to these Greek heroes. In 1440, on 
the death of his father, Frederick I (1372-1440), 
the territorial possessions of the Hohenzollern 
family were divided among Frederick's three 
sons. Brandenburg went to Albert's brother

ALBERT 


Frederick, who became the Elector Frederick U 
( 1413 ^ 71 ); the principality of Bayreuth went to 
Albert's brother )ohn (d 1464); and Albert re- 
ceived the principality of Ansbach. The lands ot 
his brothers eventually came into Albert's pos* 
session, he inherited Bayreuth from iohn, and 
received Brandenburg through the abdication 
of Frederick II in 1470. Albert strengthened the 
Hohenzollern hold on Brandenburg by warring 
against independent towns and princes and by 
providing against a possible dispersal of the 
family lands after his death Ho sc'cured the fu- 
ture of Hohenzollern lands by his Di^posnio 
Achillea ("The Political Testament of Achilles"), 
made public in 1473, by which he provided that 
Brandenburg should at his death go intact to his 
oldest son, and the Franconian lands (see Fran 
conia) of the Hohenzollerns go intact to the 
younger, and that in all succeeding generations 
both parts of the family holdings should de- 
scend only to oldest sons. By this dec laration AL 
bert established among the noble familfes of 
Germany the principle of primogeniture (q.v,). 
ALBERT (1490-1545), known as AlBERf Of 
BRANDENBURG, Archbishopof Magdeburg and 
Archbishop and Elector of Mainz. He was the 
younger son of the elector of Brancienburg, In 
1513 he became archbishop of Magdeburg. The 
following year he became archbishop and elec • 
tor of Mainz, and in 1518 he was named a cardi- 
nal. In order to pay the expenses involved m ob- 
taining high office, he was granted permission 
by the pope to sell indulgences. Among his 
agents in this enterprise was the German monk 
Johann Tetzel (q.v,), against whom the theses of 
the German religious reformer Martin luther 
(q.v.) were directed. In the ensuing struggle be- 
tween Catholics and Protestants, Albert adhered 
to the Roman Catholic Church, but acted as 
peacemaker between the two factions at the 
Imperial Diet at Augsburg m 1530. Albert was 
the first German ruler to receive Jesuits in his 
dommions. Despite his loyalty to the Church, he 
granted religious liberty to his subiects, many of 
whom were Protestants, on condition that they 
pay his debts of about half a million florins

Clinftale. Throughout the year the climate var- 
ies considerably from n. to s. In the n. and cen- 
tral regions the mean annual temperature is 35® 
F.; s. of Calgary the annual mean is 40® F., except 
in the Rocky Mts., where it is 30® F. Winters are 
severe throughout the province; the lanuary 
mean temperature ranges from -10® F, in the n. 
to 7® F. at Edmonton, 14® F. at Calgary, and 16® 
F. at Lethbridge, In the summer the July mean is 
6S® F. throughout the province, except in the 
extreme n.w. and the Rockies, where it averages 
55® F., and in the s.i., svhere if is about 70® F. 
The average frost-free period varies from 90 days 
in the n. to 130 days ir^ the s. 

The amount of precipitation varies likewise 
from N, to s. The area of the province h. of a line 
running westward from the lip of lake Atha-

Plants. Short and mixed grasses grow in the re- 
gion s. of Calgary and e. of the foothills. Be- 
tween Calgary and Edmonton, in a band that 
widens like a cornucopia opening on the Sas- 
katchewan boundary, is a wide variety of wheat, 
brome, and reed grasses, flowering cinquefoil, 
anemone, vetch, and sweet pea. Larger vegeta- 
tion consists of aspen, black poplar, Saskatoon 
bush, highbush cranberry, wiHow, bur oak, 
Manitoba maple, elm, and green ash. These spe- 
cies also are found in patches m the province, 
particularly in the Peace R. area. From Edmon- 
ton northward, except for the n.e, corner, a mix- 
ture of deciduous and coniferous woods is 
found. Including poplar and spruce, lodgepole 
pine, Alpine fir, whitebark pine, Alpine larch, 
Douglas fir, willow, hazel, cranberry, and rose. 
West of Edmonton poplars and evergreens are 
found. Mosses and lichens are common and 
form a spongy muskeg. In the s.e. region the 
Cypress Hills are an island of mixed woods in 
the grass plains. In the n.e. area white spruce, 
balsam fir, black spruce, tamarack or larch, jack 
pine, and white birch cover vast tracts of land. 
£r>ge!mann spruce grows on the mountain 
slopes. The forests of Alberta are of great impor- 
tance because they retard the runoff on the e.

Animals. Much of the province is a natural 
fur-producing area Larger animals of Alberta in- 
clude the caribou, bison, antelope, moose, deer, 
elk, and bear. Timber wolves, coyotes and foxes, 
muskrats, squirrels, beavers, weasels, and smaller 
rodents, such as mice and gophers, are com- 
mon Ducks, geese, and upland fowl, such as 
praine chicken, partridge, and pheasant, are 
abundant in the summer and fall. Whitefish, 
lake trout, pike, pickerel, and tullibee are the 
common fish in Alberta lakes. 

Parks and Other Places of Interest The four 
national parks in Alberta cover a total area of 
20,792 sq mi. Banff National Park, in the S.w set - 
tion of the province, totals 2564 sq.mi. in area 
and attracts tourists from many countries, lasper 
National Park, a larger mountain park 21S miles 
w. of Edmonton, has an area of 4200 sq.mi. Wa* 
terton Lakes National Park (203 sq.mt.) is contig 
uous with Glacier National Park in the State of 
Montana. Elk Island National Park (7*5 sq.mi.) is a 
fenced game preserve m central Alberta, about 
30 miles E. of Edmonton. In the far n , divided by 
the border between Alberta and the Northw«»st 
Territories, is Wood Buffalo National Park. The 
park covers 17,3(X) sq mi., of which 13,650 sq.rni

Education and Cultural Facilities. The educa- 
tional system of the provmce provides for pub- 
lic and separate schools from the first grade 
through high school. The separate schools usu- 
ally are Roman Catholic; but in areas where the 
Roman Catholic population predominates, the 
public school is Catholic and the Protestant 
school, if population is sufficient to warrant one, 
is the separate school. Education in provincially 
supported schools is compulsory and free. The 
curriculum is selected and supervised at the 
provincial level, with administration of plant 
and staff conducted at the local level. 
Elementary and Secondary Schools. In the 
mid-1970's, Alberta had 1300 elementary and 
secondary schools with an annual enrollment of 
about 417,800 students. Courses in the pure, 
practical, and social sciences are provided by 
the high schools, as are optional courses in the 
technical, business, and homemaking fields. 
Colleges and Universities, In the mid-l970's 
total enrollment in Alberta's colleges and uni- 
versities was about 30,000 students. The most 
important schools are the University of Alberta

(enrollment, 20,166) in Edmonton, the Univer- 
sity of Calgary (enrollment, 10,982) In Calgary, 
and the University of Lethbridge (enrollment, 
1,336) in Lethbridge. There are a number of pub- 
lic junior and community colleges that offer a 
year or two of study beyond high school; Atha- 
basca University offers extension courses. 

Courses in the fine and performing arts are 
offered by the Banff School of Fine Arts, associ- 
ated with the University of Calgary, and by the 
Alberta College of Art and the Southern Alberta 
Institute of Technology, both m Calgary 
Libraries and Museums. Alberta has more than 
150 public libraries. The University of Alberta 
campus is the site of Rutherford Library, which 
includes the faculty libraries and an extension 
library. The provincial government maintains 
the legislative library in the legislature buildings 
in Edmonton, and the Alberta Law Society has 
law libraries in major centers of the province 
Among the main museums is the Banff National 
Park Museum of Natural History in Banff. Civic 
art centers are located in Calgary (the Allied Arts 
Centre and Art Gallery, Coste House) and Ed- 
monton (the Edmonton Museum of Arts)

ALBERTA 


THE ECONOMY 

The economy of Alberta was almost completely 
agricultural until 1947, when the discovery of 
large oil pools resulted m the establishment of 
new industries. In the mid-1970's about 14,3 per- 
cent of the total labor force was engaged m ag- 
riculture, 4.4 percent in other primary industries, 
9.6 percent in manufacturing, 7 4 percent m 
construction, 9.0 percent in transportation, 17,3 
percent in trade, and 38.0 percent in service, 

Hydroelectric power potential has been ex- 
tensively developed on the Bow, Cascade, and 
Kananaskis rivers. The Big Bend development on 
the Brazeau R. has an installed annual capacity 
of more than 300,000 kw. Despite these re- 
sources, thermal power accounted for about 87 
percent of all power generated in the province 
m the mid-1970^s. A coal-fired generating station 
was under construction at Dodds, S,£. of Edmon- 
ton. Total generating capacity was 3,300,000 kw. 
Manufacturing. The total value of shipments 
of manufactured goods in the mid-1970'$ was 
about $3.4 billion. Food and beverage process- 
ing and manufacturing accounted for $1.2 bil- 
lion, about 38 percent of the total output. Other 
important industries were petroleum refining 
($433,000,000); primary metals and metal fabri- 
cating ($425,000,000); wood products ($172,000,- 
000); nonmetallics, mainly structural materials 
($153,000,000); transportation equipment 
($153,000,000), printing and publishing 
($126,000,000); and paper manufacturing 
($119,000,000). 

Meat processing and packing constitutes a 
major part of the food industry in the province; 
canning and freezing produce from S, Alberta 
comprises another large sector of the food-pro- 
cessing industry. Beer and liquor making, break- 
fast-cereal production, flour milling, and sugar- 
beet refining are also Important. With the devel- 
opment of the petroleum industry, oil refineries 
were established for the production of lubricat- 
ing oils and gasolines. Natural, gas is broken 
down and constituent parts are used in the pro- 
duction of cellulose acetate fibers, chemicals, 
and plastics. Other industries include box mak- 
ing, the processing of dairy products, garment 
making, lumber milling, and the manufacture of 
glass and pottery. Cement plants are located 
near Banff and Edmonton. 

Agriculture. About 238,000 persons were liv- 
ing on more than 62,500 farms in Alberta, ac- 
cording to the 1971 census. Farms of 560 acres or 
larger numbered over 16,000. Total cash receipts 
from farm operations in Alberta in the mid- 
1970's were nearly $2 billion annually. The total 
was divided almost equally between crops

($992,000,000) and livestock production 
($921 ,000, (XX)). The growth at farm income in 
the province has been rapid, m 1970 total re- 
ceipts were only S70S,tXX).(XX) AibertaS agricul-

the mid-l97DS there w^ere at^oyf 28, 5<X>,{X)0 acres 
of improvcHl farmland m the province, of which 
18,100,(XX) were under cultivation Most of the 
rest was improved pasture or summer fallow. Al- 
berta has about l/X)0,CXX) beef c attle, roughly 32 
percent of the total for C*anacJa. It also produces 
about Si percent of Canada's barley (24S,CX)0,000 
bu.), ll percent of the oats OmmiOm by.), 
and 22 percent of the whc*at {ia2,CXX),CXX) bu.). 

Wheat IS the preciominani crop m the dry- 
land area m the s,i part cd the prcwime. The 
most extensive wheat ^ growing regions, compris- 
ing some 4,CX)0,CXX) ac res, are found m the semi- 
circular band that surrounds the dry^-land area. 
Where the land is ynsyitabte for c ultivation, cat- 
tle and sheep are raised on ranges where 
grasses, although vcaru% have a high nutritive 
value. In the s pintmm wbeai growing or rattle

MJiilfig. Alberta fi by far Canada's leading 
province m the producbon of mineral lytls. The 
value of crude oil, naiyral gas, and natural ps 
by-products in the mici-1970*s was tS,64 billion, 
about 89, 8 percent of the total lor the country at 
targe. 

The first maior oil disc'overy m the province 
was made at Tomer Valley in the 192ffs; the next 
importani field, ieduc, was opened up in 1947. 
Since that time nomeroys other discoveries 
have been made, mclyding ihe world's largest 
known reserve of oil-bearing tar sands, known

as the Athabasca deposit, near Fort McMurray. 

Oil protJuction in the miti-1970's was about 
446,400,000 bhl per day. The annual value of 
production was $T.2*i billion. Production from 
the Athabasca sands deposits was about 50,000 


Ciant excavator. Great Canadian Oil Sands Plant, Al-

Alberta has vast reserves of natural gas. Gas is 
still used to a significant extent to fuel homes 
and industry within the province, but most of it 
is now exported to other provinces and to the 
U.S. through a system of pipelines built since 
the T950's. Annual production of gas in the mid- 
1970's was 2..58 billion cu.ft., with a value of $1.6 
billion. 


than 94,CXX) sq.mi., or about 37 percent, is pro- 
ductive forest land. The forests not only support 
an important lumber industry but are also of 
great value to individuals as fuel and building 
material. White spruce accounts for about 75 
percent of the timber cut annually in Alberta. 
Tourism. Main tourist attractions include Cal- 
gary, Edmonton, and the national parks Some 
3,800,000 persons travel through Alberta each 


Alberta is also Canada's leading producer of 
coal, accounting for about 39 percent of the 
country's output. Annual production in the mid- 
1970's was 10,500,000 tons, with a value of about 
$185,000,000. The most important mines are lo- 
cated in the Rocky Mt. foothills. 

Virtually no metals are mined in the province, 
but Alberta does supply about 96 percent of 
Canada's elemental sulfur, a nonmetallic ore. 
Small deposits of gold, iron, lead, silver, and 
zinc are found, and there are extensive deposits 
of clay, gravel, and lime. Silica sands are found 
in the Peace R. region. 

Forestry. Approximately 107,000 sq.mi., or 


year, spending about $330,000,000. 
Transportation. Alberta is served by several 
transcontinental airlines, interprovincial airlines, 
and a number of charter- flight companies that 
fly principally out of Edmonton into the arctic 
region. More than 185 land and 20 seaplane 
bases are located in the province, with good air- 
fields near all of the major cities An interna- 
tional airport was opened in 1960 at a site about 
15 miles s. of Edmonton. Several U.S. airlines 
have passenger privileges in Alberta. 

In the years following World War II the prov- 
ince concentrated on a program of highway im- 
provement, and by the mid-1970's Alberta had 


373 


ALBERTA 


about 87,800 mi of highways and roads, ot 
which about 6900 mi are paved highway. 

The three major railroads operating in Al- 
berta, with more than 6200 mi of track, are the 
Canadian National Railway, the Canadian Pa- 
cific Railway, and Northern Alberta Railwavs, 
which IS owned jointly by the other two sys- 
tems. The Great Slave Lake Railway links the 
province with the Northwest Territories. 
Communications. There were private ratiio 
stations in operation in the mid-1970\ incfud 
ing 1 French-language station in Fdmonton. In 
addition 2 stations are operated by the Canadian 
Broadcasting Corporation and 2 others are 
owned by the provincial government. There 
were 7 private television stations and 2 Car>a 
dian Broadcasting Corporation stations, I of 
which operated in the French language. Direct 
telecasts from eastern Canada were received late 
in the 1950'$ by way of the trans-Canada mic ro- 
wave system. The domestic satellite communi- 
cations system came into operation in 197T, sup- 
plementing the existing microwave systems; see 
Canada: Communications. 

Daily newspapers, with a combined circula 
tion of more than 380,000, are published in Ed- 
monton, Calgary, Grande Prairie, Lethbridge, 
Medicine Hat, and Red Deer. The province has 
about 105 weekly and semiweekly publications, 
chiefly newspapers. 

GOVERNMENT 

The government of Alberta comprises the lieu- 
tenant governor, the executive council, or cabi- 
net, and the legislative assembly. The lieutenant 
governor is appointed by the Federal govern- 
ment as agent for the governor-general of Can- 
ada, who, in turn, is the representative of the 
British Crown in Canada. The head of the gov- 
ernment is the premier, The premier, leader of 
the major political party in the legislature, se- 
lects the members of the executive council from 
among the members of his party in the assem- 
bly, The executive council is responsible to the 
legislature. The legislature is patterned after 
both the British and Canadian House of Com^ 
mons, and derives authority from the British 
North America Act of 1867, as subsequently 
amended. One legislator Is elected from each of 
the 75 electoral districts. Alberta has 19 elected 
members in the Canadian House of Commons 
and 6 appointed members m the Senate. The 
provincial judicial system includes the Alberta 
supreme court. All magistrates, judges, and jus- 
tices are appointed officials,

World War I! was an economic turning point. 
War industries were attracted to Edmonton and 
Calgary, near which oil had been found In 1947 
a new oi) discovery at Leduc made the province 
a major oil and gas producer The Social Credit 
Party, led by Premier £. C. Manning, occupied 
itself with transporting oil and natural gas to 
markets in the east. In 1958 a gas pipeline to 
eastern Canada was completed. As industries

ALBERTI, Leon Battista (1404-72), Italian ar- 
chitect and writer, born m Venice. He received 
the best education available in the ISth century, 
first at the school of Barsi^ia at Padua, and then 
at the University of Sologna. He became profi- 
cient in the Greek language as well as in mathe- 
matics and the natural sciences. As a poet, a 
philosopher, and one of the first organists of his 
day, Alberti greatly influenced his contempo- 
raries. In 1432 he was appointed a papal secre- 
tary by Pope lugenius IV (see under Euginius), 
Alberti's architectural training began with the 
study of antique monuments during his first stay 
in Rome, from 1432 to 1434. Subsequently he 
joined the papal court in Florence, where he be- 
came intensely involved with the artistic life of 
the city. Among his friends and associates were 
the great architect Filippo Brunelleschi and the 
renowned sculptor Donatello (qq.v.). Probably 
at this time he discovered the mathematical 
laws of linear perspective (q.v.), which were of 
inestimable value to the pamters of his own and 
succeeding generations. Alberti took an active 
part in the literary life of Florence, and cham- 
pioned the use of the native longue Instead of 
Latin. After spending nine years in Florence and 
other parts of Italy, he returned to Rome. He 
was secretary to six popes. Under Pope Nicholas 
V (see under Nichoias), he was in charge of the 
projects for rebuilding Saint Peter's Basilica and 
the Vatican. 


ALBERT, LAKE 

Although his buildings rank among the best 
architecture of the Renaissance, Alberti was a 
theoretical rather than a practical architect He 
furnished the plans of his buildings but never 
supervised their construction His art is the most 
strictly classical of the early Renaissance and 
prepared the way for the architectural style of 
Bramante (q.v.) and other architects of the High 
Renaissance. The purity of Alberti's art is evi- 
dent in the fagade of the church of San Fran- 
cesco at Rimmi, adapted from the arch of Au- 
gustus at Rimmi, Alberti had a number of pupils 
and associates, who earned out his plans for the 
facade of Santa Maria Novella and the Rucellai 
Palace (1446-51), both in Florence, and other fa- 
mous buildings. His De Re /Edificatoria ("Con- 
cerning Architecture", 1485) was the first 
printed work on architecture of the Renais- 
sance. He also wrote manuals on architecture, 
statuary, and painting; his treatises on painting 
were the most Important for the study of that 
form of art before Leonardo da Vinci (q v ) 
ALBERTI, Rafael (1903- ), Spanish poet, born 
in Puerto de Santa Maria, and educated at the 
local Jesuit academy. He studied painting in 
Madrid from 1918 to 1924 when he turned to the 
writing of poetry. His first volume, childhood 
recollections of the sea entitled Marinero en 
Tterra (1924; Eng. Trans., "A Sailor on Land"), 
won the Spanish National Prize for Literature in 
1925, Subsequently he traveled in France, Ger- 
many, and the Soviet Union. Meanwhile he 
wrote poetry characterized by an inventive 
treatment of folk themes as m the collections La 
Amante (1926; Eng. trans., "The Lover") and El 
Alba del Alhelf (1927; Eng. trans,, "The Dawn of 
the Gillyflower"). In Cal y Canto (1929; Eng 
trans., "Lime and Stone") he utilizes complex 
baroque verse forms in expressing his view of 
20th-century civilization. His masterpiece, Sobre 
hs Angeles (1929; Eng, trans., "Above the An- 
gels"), 1$ a surrealistic allegory in which angels 
represent various forces in the real world. 

Alberti supported leftist causes in the early 
1930's, and during the Spanish Civil War he 
served with the Loyalist air force; see Spain. After 
the war he emigrated to Argentina. His subse- 
quent writings in general have been considered 
inferior to his earlier work. He received the 
Lenin Peace Prize in 1%5.

ALBERTUS MAGNUS, Saint, called AlBfRl 
THE GREAT (1206-80), German scholastic theo- 
logian and scholar, born in iauingen. He en- 
tered the Dominican order m 1223, taught m 
Cologne and Pans, served as bishop of Ratisbon 
(now Regensburg, in West Germany) from 1260 
to 1262, and continued active thereafter as an 
influential teacher, ecclesiastical administrator, 
and preacher. His most noted pupil was the Ital- 
ian scholastic philosopher Thomas Aquinas {see 
Aquinas, Saint Thomas). Albert's immense schol- 
arly labors made it possible for the medieval 
Christian world to know Greek and Arabian 
science and philosophy. He is especially known 
for his attempts to reconcile Christian theology 
with the teachings of the ancient Greek philos- 
opher Aristotle (q.v.). In addition, he engaged in 
biological research and reported at length his 
observations and speculations in various other 
scientific fields. His chief works are Summa de 
Creatum ('Treatise about Mankind"), which 
deals mainly with man and his immortal soul, 
and Summa Theologiae ("Treatise on Theolo- 
gy"), an unfinished account of God as the cause 
and goal of all creatures. Pope Pius Xi {see 
under Pius) declared him a Saint and a doctor of 
the Church m 1932; his feast is Nov. 15. See

ALBINO# mcJfvicfyai with hereditary defi-

cies. The pigment melanm, primary cause of 
normal human coloratitm, is abscmt m the 
tissues of human albmos binause the enzyme 
tyrosinase, required lor ds lotmatmn, is lacking* 
As a result, albinos have pale skm, white or light 
yellow hair, and eyes which, although actually 
colorless, appear pink because the blood vessels 
of the retina are visible. Lacking the protection 
that pigmem affords against strong light, albinos 
are phoiophobic (shunning light) and, in ordi- 
nary illuminabon are inclined to squint. Ab- 
sence of melanm m certain bram tissues is prob- 
ably the cause of the nystagmus (oscillation of 
the eyeballs), characienstic of most albinos.

ALBUMIN 



Animal albtmsm i$ cauwd by a lack of the pigment 
melanin, Such animals, weakened and easily sighted by 
enemies, rarely survive in their natural habitat, upi 


Albinos occur in all races ol humans, most 
frequently among certain Indian tribes of the 
southwestern United States, but nowhere m 
large numbers. Albinism is transmitted as a re- 
cessive characteristic Several types of partial al- 
binism exist, including dominant piebald albi- 
nism, dominant white forelock, and 
chromosomal sex-linked ocular albinism. See 
Heredity: Dominance; Linkage; Mendel's Law. 

Animal albinism, similar to that of humans In 
its cause, effects, and transmission, has been ob- 
served in most species of domestic animals anci 
in a wide variety of other mammals and birds. 
The white rabbits, white rats, and white mice 
common in biological laboratories are true albi- 
nos. Forms of albinism cxcur in cold-blooded 
animals, but their causes are different. Albinism 
m frogs and certain salamanders, for example, is 
apparently caused by hormonal deficiency, be- 
cause it can be cured by an injection of pituitary 
hormone. In fish, complete or spotty melanism 
(atypical black color) or albinism can be in- 
duced by merely severing certain nerves. Most 
cases of so-called albinism m insects are prob- 
ably color variations rather than the complete 
absence of pigmentation characteristic of albino 
mammals. Albinism in plants is always quickly 
fatal, because the plant cannot manufacture its 
food without the pigment chlorophyll (q.v.). See 
also Pigment, Ni*M.

ALBRIGHT, William Foxwell (1891-1971), 
American archeologist and educator noted for 
his work in the Middle East 

Born of missionary parents May 24, 1891, in 
Coquimbo, Chile, Albright studied at Upper 
Iowa University and earned his ph d in archeol- 
ogy and linguistics at Johns Hopkins University 
m 1916. He became director of the American 
School of Oriental Research m Jerusalem in 
1921. In 1929 he was made professor of Semitic 
languages at Johns Hopkins, a post he held until 
he acquired emeritus status in 1958 Albright 
was one of the leading Biblical archeologists of 
his time, heading numerous expeditions in Pal- 
estine, southern Arabia, and adjacent regions 
An expert in reconstructing past civilizations 
from their artifacts, he gained a wide reputation 
for his identification of "lost" Bible towns and 
his use of potsherds to date archeological finds 
His more than 800 publications included From 
the Stone Age to Christianity (1940) and Yahweh 
and the Cods of Canaan (1968). Albright died 
Sept, 19, 1971, in Baltimore, Md. 

ALBUMIN, one of a class of simple proteins 
(see Protein), composed of carbon, hydrogen, 
oxygen, nitrogen, and a small percentage of sul- 
fur. Albumin IS coagulable by heat, mineral 
acids, alcohol, and ether and is soluble in water 
and in a weak salt solution An important article 
of diet, albumin is present in such animal tissues 
as egg white, milk, and muscle, and is found in 
blood plasma (see Blood: Composition of 
Blood* Plasma); it occurs also in plants, especial- 
ly in seeds. During World War II pure human- 
blood-serum albumin was prepared in large 
quantities for use in transfusions (see Blood* 
Blood Transfusion: Transfusion of Plasma), Be- 
cause albumin coagulates when heated to 
160*^ F. (71^ C), It is useful for removing cloudy 
precipitates, thus clarifying solutions in sugar re- 
fining and other processes. With many metallic 
salts, such as bichloride of mercury, sulfate of 
copper, and nitrate of silver, albumin forms in- 
soluble compounds or albuminates, and is 
therefore used as an antidote to these poisons.

an oil refinery, packing and canning plants, and 
brickworks are among the principal industrial 
establishments. The city is a popular health and 
vacation resort It is the site of the University of 
New Mexico (1889, coeducational), which in 
the mid-1960's had an enrollment of about 12,- 
000 students and a faculty of about 675. Albu-

ALBUQUERQUE, Affonso de, called AF- 
FONSO O grande or affonso THE GREAT 
(1453-1515), Portuguese navigator and states- 
naan, and founder of the Portuguese empire in 
the Orient, born in Alhandra, near Lisbon. He 
spent his youth at the court of Alfonso V (q.v.), 
King of Portugal, and later took part in the expe- 
dition against the Turks that culminated in a 
Christian victory of Otranto, Italy, in 1481. In 
1503 he made his first trip to the East, traveling 
with a Portuguese fleet around the Cape of 
Good Hope to India. Three years later Emanuel 
(q.v.), King of Portugal, appointed him viceroy 
of all Portuguese possessions in Asia. His prede- 
cessor, the Portuguese colonial governor Fran- 
cisco de Almeida (q.v.), refused to give up his 
office, and imprisoned Albuquerque from 1508 
to 1509 The new viceroy was eventually re- 
leased to assume office when a fleet arrived 
from Portugal to free him. As viceroy, Albuquer- 
que captured the district of Goa, tnciia, in 1510, 
and completed the conquest of Malabar, Cey- 
lon, the Sunda Islands, the peninsula of Ma- 
lacca, and the island of Hormuz at the entrance 
to the Persian Guff, He maintained strict military 
discipline in the territories under his control, 
but was respected and beloved by his subjects. 

In spite of his valuable services, Albuquerque 
was the victim of intrigue at the Portyguese 
court. In 1515 King Emanuel, who had become 
suspicious of the viceroy, appointed one of Al- 
buquerque's personal enemies as his successor. 
Although he was offered assistance to help him 
resist Emanuel's arbitrary decree, Albuquerque 
would not violate his allegiance. A few days

after receiving notice that he had been super-

Pittacus, whereupon he seems to have returned 
to Mytilene little is known about hts later life. 
Of the ten books of hts odes, only a few poems 
in fragmentary form are extant, these, all com- 
posed in the Aeolic dialect, are for the most part 
concerned with his grief over the state of Les- 
bos, his hatred of tyrants, and his own misfor- 
tunes; in some of the poems he praises love and 
wine. Alcaeus was the uwentor of the Alcaic 
stanza, which the Roman poet Horace (q.v.) 
subsequently adapted to I atm lync poetry.

ALCHEMILLA. See Lady's Mantle 
ALCHEMY^ ancient art practiced especially in 
the Middle Ages, devoted chiefly to discovering 
a substance that would transmute the more 
common metals into gold or silver, and to find- 
ing a means of indefinitely prolonging human 
life Although its purposes and its techniques 
were dubious and often illusory, alchemy was in 
many ways the predecessor of modern science, 
especially the science of chemistry. 

The birthplace of alchemy was ancient Egypt, 
where, in Alexandria, it began to flourish m the 
Hellenistic period; simultaneously, a school of 
alchemy was developing in China. The writings 
of some of the early Greek philosophers might 
be considered to contain the first chemical 
theories, and the theory advanced in the 5th 
century b.c by Empedocles (q.v ), that all things 
are composed of air, earth, fire, and water, was 
influential in alchemy. The Roman emperor 
Caligula (q.v) is said to have instituted experi- 
ments for producing gold from orpiment, a sul- 

- - - 


fide of arsenic, and the emperor Diocletian (q 
V ) IS said to have ordered all Egyptian works 
concerning the chemistry of gold and silver to 
be burned in order to stop such experiments. 
Zosimus the Theban (about 250-300 ad) dis- 
covered that sulfuric ‘acid is a solvent of metals, 
and he liberated oxygen from the red oxide of 
mercury. 

The fundamental concept of alchemy stem- 
med from the Aristotelian doctrine that all 
things tend to reach perfection Since other 
metals were thought to be less "perfect" than 
gold, It was reasonable to assume that nature 
formed gold out of other metals deep within 
the earth, and that with sufficient skill and dili- 
gence an artisan could duplicate this process in 
his workshop Efforts toward this goal were em- 
pirical and practical at first, but by the 4th cen- 
tury AD, astrological and magical theory and rit- 
ual had begun to gain prominence. 

A school of pharmacy flourished in Arabia 
during the caliphates of the Abbasids from 750 
to 1258; see Caliph. The earliest known work of 
this school is the Summa Perfectionis^ or "Sum- 

Two alchemists arc portrayed m this woodcut from the 
earliest retards on chemistry, Summa Perfectionis 




ALCHEMY 


mit of Perfection'^ written m the 8th century by 
the Arabian scientist Geber (Jabir tbn-Hayyan, 
fl. 721-76); the work is consequently the oldest 
book on chemistry proper in the world, and is a 
collection of all that was then known and be- 
lieved The Arabian alchemists worked with 
gold and mercury, arsenic and sulfur, and salts 
and acids, and became familiar with a wide 
range of what are now called chemical reagents 
They believed that metals are compound 
bodies, made up of mercury and sulfur in differ- 
ent proportions. Their scientific creed was the 
potentiality of transmutation, and their methods 
were mostly blind gropings; yet, in this way, 
they found many new substances, and invented 
many useful processes. To the Arab alchemists 
we owe the terms alcohol, alkali, borax, and 
elixir 

From the Arabs, alchemy found its way 
through Spain into Europe generally. In the 
Middle Ages it was chiefly the monks who oc- 
cupied themselves with alchemy. The earliest 
authentic works extant on European alchemy 
are those of the English monk Roger Bacon and 
the German philosopher Saint Albertus Magnus 
(qq.v.); both believed in the possibility of trans- 
muting inferior metals into gold This idea ex- 
cited the imagination, and later the avarice, of 
many persons during the Middle Ages. They be- 
lieved gold to be the perfect metal, and that 
baser metals were removed by various degrees 
of imperfection from gold. Thus they sought to 
fabricate or discover a substance, the so-called 
Philosopher's stone, so much more perfect than 
gold that it could bring the baser metals up to 
the perfection of gold. 

Roger Bacon believed potable gold (gold dis- 
solved in aqua regia) to be the elixir of life. Ai- 
bertus Magnus had a great mastery of the practi- 
cal chemistry of his time. The Italian Scholastic 
philosopher Saint Thomas Aquinas, the Catalan 
churchman Raymond Lully (qq.v.), and the sup- 
posed Benedictine monk Basil Valentine (11. 
15th cent.) also did much to further the progress 
of chemistry, although along alchemical lines, m 
discovering the uses of antimony, the manufac- 
ture of amalgams, and the Isolation of spirits of 
wine, or ethyl alcohol. 

Important compilations of recipes and tech- 
niques in this period included De fa Pkotechnia 
("The Pirotechnia", 1540) by the Italian metal- 
lurgist Vannoccio Binnguccio; de re Metatlica 
("Concerning Metals", 1530) by the German 
mineralogist Georgius Agricola (q.v.); and Al- 
chemia (1597) by Andreas LIbau (d. 1616), a Ger- 
man naturalist and chemist. 

Most famous of all was the 16th-century Swiss 


alchemist Phtitppus Paracehm (q.v ). Paracelsus 
held that the elements of compound bodies 
were salt, sulfur, and mercury, representing re- 
spectively earth, air. and water, tire he regarded 
as imponderable, or nonmatenal He believed, 
however, m the existence of one undiscovered 
element common to all, ot which the four ele- 
ments of the ancients were merely derivative 
forms. This prime element ot creation Paracel- 
sus termed alkahest, and he maintained that if it 
were found, it would prose to be the philoso- 
pher's stone, the universal medicine, and the ir- 
resistible solvent 

After Parac elsus, tht^ ak hemists ot Europe be- 
came divided into two groups. One group was 
composed of men who earnestly devoted them- 
selves to tht" scientitK dtscoverv ot new com- 
pounds anci reactions, and who were the legiti- 
mate ancestors of modern c hernistry as ushered 
in by the* work of the Frcmch chemist Anton 
Laurent Uvoisier (q.\.), see CnIiMistry: History, 
The othc^r group tcK>k up the visionary, meta- 
physical side of the older alchemy and devel- 
oped It into a prac lie e based on imposture, nec- 
romant y, and fraucf, from which the prevailing 
notion of alchemy is derived S.Z.L.

duced the Athenians to undertake an expedi- 
tion agamst Syracuse, for which he was elected 
one of the commanders. Before the departure of 
the expi»dition, afl the statues of the god 
Hermes (q.v.) in Athens were mutilated in a sin- 
gle night; the blame for the sacrilege was laid 
upon Akibtades, who was charged with impiety 
and recalled from the expedition. On his return 
he landed at Thurii and fled to Sparta, where he 
divulged the plans of the enterprise and helped 
the allied Spartans and Syracusans to defeat the 
Athenians, For this act of treason, a sentence of 
death was recorded against him at Athens and 
his property was confiscated. 

In 414 8C Akibiades went with the Spartan

expedition to the island of Khios (q.v.), where 
he incited an Ionian revolt (see Ionians) against 
the Athenians. Difficulties with the Spartan 
leaders led to a plot to assassinate Alcibiades 
On learning of the plot, Alcibiades fled to the 
Persian provincial governor Tissaphernes (fl. 3rd 
cent. BC) and attempted without success to win 
him over to the Athenians on the ground that it 
was in the interest of Persia to prevent Sparta 
from gaming complete ascendancy over Athens. 
Alcibiades then offered to bring Persian support 
to the Athenians if they would revoke the de- 
cree making him an exile. His offer was ac- 
cepted, but he wished to render some service to 
Athens before returning. He therefore remained 
abroad and won important victories for the 
Athenians, including the capture of the cities of 
Cyzicus, Chalcedon, and Byzantium. Alcibiades 
returned to Athens in 407 bc and was received 
with general enthusiasm. He was again sent to 
Asia with a hundred ships, but the expedition 
was defeated at Notium m 406 s.c As a result his 
enemies brought a new accusation against him, 
and he was relieved of his command. He there- 
upon again fomed the Persians, taking refuge in 
Phrygia, At the request of the Athenian govern- 
ment, and with the approval of the Spartans, Al- 
cibtades' residence was set on fire during the 
night, and, as he fled, he was killed by a volley 
of arrows. See Ostracism.

ALCIPHRON, (fl. about 180), Greek rhetori- 
cian, best known as the author of 118 extant 
epistles, written in correct and elegant Attic 
speech (see Greek Language: Ancient Creek) 
The letters are ostensibly written by fishermen, 
peasants, courtesans, beggars, and other com- 


moners of Athens m the 4th century bc, they 
are valuable for their character sketches and for 
their representation of Athenian morals, man- 
ners, and customs of the period Some of the 
epistles of the courtesans are believed to be 
based upon lost comedies of the Greek play- 
wright Menander (q v ) and have been used to 
recreate the plots of the plays 
ALCMAEON. See Seven Against Thebes 
ALCMAN (fl about 625 bc), Greek poet, born 
in Sardis, in Lydia. Aleman was one of the ear- 
liest of the famous lyric poets of Greece, and 
the first known to write choral lyrics m strophic 
form (see Ode) According to tradition, he was a 
slave who was freed and made a citizen of 
Sparta He wrote, m the Doric dialect, Parthenia 
(songs for choruses of virgins), bridal hymns, 
and verses in praise of love and wme. (see Greek 
Language. Ancient Creek) Only fragments of 
his poems are extant, the longest fragment is 
part of a song that was found on a papyrus in 
Egypt in 1855.

reer in aviation began when he obtained an avi- 
ator's certificate in 1912. During World War 1 he 
served as an officer with the Royal Naval Air 
Force and in 1917 took part in the bombing of 
Constantinople (now Istanbul), Turkey. In June, 
1919, he and Lieutenant Arthur Whitten Brown 
(1886-1948), another British aviator, made the 
first nonstop flight across the Atlantic Ocean, 
flying from Saint John's, Newfoundland, to Clif- 
den, Ireland, in 16 hr. and 12 min. Alcock was

ALCOFORADO, Marianna (1640-1723), Por- 
tuguese nun and writer, born in Beja. She had 
been a nun m the Franciscan convent of the 
Conception in Beja for nine years when, in 1665, 
she met and formed a romantic attachment to 
No^l Bouton, later the Marquis de Chamilly 
(1636-1715), a French official on duty near Beja. 
As a result of the scandal that developed when 
their relationship was discovered, Bouton de- 
serted her and returned to France, Her five let- 
ters to him, written during the next two years 
and published anonymously in France as Lettres 
Portugaises (1669; Eng trans , The Letters of a 
Portuguese Nun, 1678), are among the most 
beautiful and touching ever written. The despair 
and anguish of the nun are exposed with un- 
flinching honesty and perceptive self-analysis. 
Some critics have cast doubt on the authenticity 
of the letters, chiefly because the Portuguese 
originals have never been found Other critics.

ALCOHOL 


however, accept them as genuine on the basis 
of strong historical evidence of the romance be- 
tween Marianna and Bouton. 

ALCOHOL (Ar al-kuhuf) term applied to 
members of a group of chemical compounds, 
and, in popular usage, to the specific compound 
ethyl alcohol The Arabic word denoted kohl, a 
very fine powder of antimony that Egyptian and 
Arabian women used as an eye makeup. The 
word alcohol originally denoted any fine pow- 
der, the alchemists of medieval Europe later 
used the word for essences (ultimate, purified 
substances) obtained by distillation, and this led 
to the current usage 

Alcohols are a class of organic compounds 
containing the hydroxyl group, OH, attached to 
a carbon atom If this same carbon atom is also 
attached to two other hydrogen atoms, the alco- 
hol IS a primary alcohol, if it is attached to only 
one other hydrogen atom, a secondary alcohol; 
and if the carbon atom is attached to no other 
hydrogen atom, a tertiary alcohol. Ordinary 
ethyl alcohol is a primary alcohol Alcohols, al- 
though analogous to inorganic bases, are nei- 
ther acid nor alkaline and are neutral to test pa- 
pers. Alcohols are chara< tenzed by many 
common reactions, the most important ot 
which IS the reaction with acids to form sub 
stances called esters (q.v.), analogous to inor- 
ganic salts 

Alcohol is a normal by-product m assimilation 
and digestion; it is found m the tissues and 
fluids of the human body and in plants. 

Wood Alcohol* Methyl alcohol, or methanol 
CH3OH, is the simplest of all the alcohols; it has 
m.p. -144° F. (-97.8° C) and b.p. 148.9° F. 
(64.%° C) It was formerly made by the destruc- 
tive distillation of wood; however, almost 90 
percent of the methanol produced at present 1$ 
synthetic, made from hydrogen and carbon 
monoxide Methyl alcohol is used as a denatu- 
rant for alcohol, as an antifreeze, as a solvent for 
gums and lacquers, and in the synthesis of many 
organic compounds, particularly formaldehyde 
(q.v.). When taken mternally, by either drinking 
the liquid or inhaling the vapors, methyl alcohol 
is a violent poison (q.v.). 

Ethyl Alcohol Ethyl alcohol QH5OH, is 
known also as gram alcohol, ethanol and 
methyl carbinol It has sp-gr. at 60° F. (153° C) 
of 0.794, b.p. 173 3° F. (78.5° C.), and m,p. about 
...179° F. (-1173° C). Ethyl alcohol is a limpid, 
colorless liquid, of burning taste, and character- 
istic, agreeable odor. Because of its low freezing 
point. It has been used as the fluid in thermom- 
eters for temperatures below -40° C, the 


freezing point ot mercur\', and for other special, 
low-temperature purposes, such as for anti- 
freeze m automobile radiators. Soiling points of 
solutions of alcohol m water containing more 
than BS percent alcohol are fowler than that of 
pure alcohol The lowest boiling point (78,174° 
C.) IS obtained with a mixture containing 95,57 
perc eni ak ohol by weight (97.2 percent by vol- 
ume) Alcohol IS normally concentrated by dis- 
tillation ot dilute solutions, but the concentra- 
tion cannot proceed bevond 97,2 percent by 
volume Commerciaf akohol contains 95 per- 
cent by volume ot ak ohol and S percent of 
water Dehydrating agents art* used to remove 
the remaining water ancf produc e absolute alco- 
hol. 

Ethyl akohol has been made since prehistoric 
times by the termentatiun of sugars. All bever- 
age ak ohol and moo* than half of industrial al- 
cohol IS still made by this process. Starch from 
potatoes, c orn, or other < i*feaK can be the raw 
material; see FotMtNUOON The veast enzyme,

com^entrated to 95 pen cmt by a series of distil- 
lauons. In the producbcm of beverages such as 
whiskey (q v ) and brandy some of the impun- 
ties,whK h supply the flavor, are of great value 
Much nondrinkmg alcohol is now made syn- 
thetically, either frcjm acetaldehyde made from 
acetyfcme, or from ethylene made from petro- 
leum A small amount is also made from wood 
pulp 

Ethyl akohol can in* oxidized to form first 
acetaldehyde and them acetic acid (q.v,). It can 
be dehydrated to form ether (q.v ). Butadiene

tured alcohol contains small amounts, 1 percent 
or 2 percent each, of several different unpleas- 
ant or poisonous substances The removal of ail 
these substances would involve a series of treat- 
ments more expensive than the Federal excise 
tax on alcoholic beverages These denaturants 
render alcohol unfit for many industrial uses In 
such industries especially denatured alcohol is 
used under closer Federal supervision Many 
formulas for special types of denatured alcohol 
are approved by the United States government 
Higher Alcohols* Fiigher alcohols, those of 
greater molecular weight than ethyl alcohol, 
have many specifK and general uses. Isopropyl 
alcohol IS used extensively as a rubbing alcohol; 
butyl alcohol is a base for perfumes and fixa- 
tives, and alcohols are important flavoring 
agents and perfumes. Polyhydric alcohols, those 
containing more than one — OFl group, are also 
important, as, for example, the tnhydnc alcohol 
known as glycerin (q.v.).

ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, or A.A., fellow- 
ship founded in 1935, the purpose of which is 
'"to help the sick alcoholic recover if he wishes'". 
Regular meetings are held by about 22, (XX) 
Alcoholics Anonymous (A.A.) groups located in 
the United States and foreign countries. World 
membership in 1975 totaled 725, OCX). The only 
membership requirement is for the self-admit- 
ted alcoholic to express a sincere desire to stop 
drinking. Members follow the A.A. program, 
consisting of twelve steps of recovery based on 
principles of human conduct found in medi- 
cine, psychiatry, religion, and in their own expe- 
rience. A.A. IS entirely supported by voluntary 
contributions from its members. A board of 
trustees, the General Service Board of A.A., 
serves without compensation. The World Serv- 
ice Office IS in New York City. 

ALCOHOLISM, chronic and progressive dis- 
ease thought to be of physiological, psychologi- 
cal, social, and genetic origins, characterized by 
an increasing dependence on or addiction to 
alcohol, and often leading In its late stages to 
brain damage or early death. It has long been 
known that the excessive consumption of alco- 
hol produces severe toxic effects, with eventual 
damage to body tissues. Only in recent years, 
however, has medical science recognized alco- 
holism as a chronic illness that responds to 
physical and psychological therapy. The disease 
affects about 6 percent of all consumers of 
alcoholic beverages; such persons, finding m 
alcohol relief from their problems and tensions, 


gradually develop an uncontrollable need, or 
even a physiological craving, for alcohol. 
Among the early symptoms of alcoholism are an 
inordinate need for alcohol at specific times of 
the day, a phenomenon known as pattern drink- 
ing, and asocial drinking. In later stages morning 
drinking becomes a necessity, and the individ- 
ual undergoes a physical, psychological, and 
social deterioration that damages his relation- 
ships with other people and reduces his capac- 
ity to earn a living. Other symptoms may in- 
clude lack of interest in food and alternate 
periods of frantic drinking and total abstinence 
In the acute stages, the alcoholic suffers succes- 
sive periods of total physical and mental ex- 
haustion Serious, and often fatal, complications 
of alcoholic poisoning may result from the 
excessive consumption of alcohol. See Delirium 
Tremens; Intoxication, Alcoholic 

The modern treatment of alcoholism in- 
cludes, particularly in the acute phase, intensive 
vitamin and nutritional therapy, the administra- 
tion of sedatives and tranquilizers, drugs that 
counteract metabolic disturbances, and suppor- 
tive psychotherapy (q.v,). Antabuse, a drug that 
produces a violent intolerance for alcohol, is 
widely used. Appropriate tranquilizers and sed- 
atives are effective in the acute stage, as m cases 
of delirium tremens. During the later stages of 
treatment, individual or group psychotherapy 
may help to resolve basic personality conflicts. 

Extensive research on alcoholism was first un- 
dertaken by the Laboratory of Applied Physiol- 
ogy at Yale University in the late 1930's, and 
subsequently by numerous other institutions 
throughout the country. Other significant ef- 
forts have been made by such national volun- 
tary organizations as the National Council on 
Alcoholism, organized in 1944, and Alcoholics 
Anonymous (q.v.). These activities finally suc- 
ceeded in establishing a new approach to alco- 
holism as a major public-health problem in the 
United States, afflicting nearly 9,000,000 people. 
By 1%9 forty-eight States had instituted pro- 
grams for the control and prevention of the dis- 
ease. The U.S. has over 200 special outpatient 
clinics for diagnosis and treatment, and an in- 
creasing number of general hospitals now ac- 
cept patients for short-term treatment of the 
acute phase of the disease. Hundreds of transi- 
tional residential facilities for extended care 
have been established. The principal arm of 
Federal Involvement in the study of alcoholism 
is the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and 
Alcoholism. It formulates and recommends na- 
tional policies and goals for the prevention, 
control, and treatment of alcoholism, and devel- 


383 



ALCOTT 


Ops programs to realize these goals The most 
immediate aim of the institute is to aid local 
communities m making available high quality 
treatment and rehabilitation services. 

Public education through public meetings 
and seminars, and in the press, radio, and 
television helps to erase the stigma and increase 
understanding of alcoholism. Early recognition 
of the disease allows victims to seek treatment 
before irreversible mental and physical damage 
occurs, but fundamental to successful rehabili- 
tation IS an understanding and enlightened 
environment

ALCOTT, name of two American writers who 
were father and daughter. 

Amos Bronson Alcott (1 799-1 8BB), American 
educator and philosopher, born in Wolcott, 
Conn. He developed a method of teaching 
young children by means of conversation, and 
m 1828 established a school at Boston, Mass., in 
which this system was employed The school 
was criticized by the press and regarded by the 
general public as a revolutionary innovation. In 
1836 Alcott closed the school and moved to 
Concord, Mass. Thereafter he became widely 
known as a lecturer. He was a prominent aboli- 
tionist and one of the leaders of the philosophic 
doctrine of Transcendentalism (q.v.). His writ- 
ings include Observations on the Principles and

Methods ot infant instruction (1830), Conversa- 
tions with Children on the Gospels (1837), 
Concord Days (1872), Table-Talk (1877), and 
Sonnets and Canzonets (1882) 

Louisa May Alcott (1832-88), American writer, 
born m Germantown, Pa, She was raised m 
Boston, Mass,, and was tutored by the American 
writers Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David 
Thoreau (qq v.) While serving as a nurse during 
the American Civil War she wrote letters to her 
family that were later published as Hospital 
Sketches (1863). Her most famous works, Little 
Women (1868), an autobiographical novel of 
her childhood, and one ot the sequels, Little 
Men (1871), are considered classics for children. 
These works are characterized by a deep sense 
of family loyalty and intimacy Her other writ- 
ings include fiower fables (1854), Moods (1864), 
An Old-fashioned Girl (1870), Work (1873), 
Spmning-Wheei Stones (1884), and lo's Boys 
(1886). 

ALCUINof ALBINUS (7^5-804), English scholar 
and ecclesiastic, born m Yorkshire, and edu- 
cated at the cathedral school of York He be- 
came the heaci of the school m 778. During a 
mission to Rome m 780. became acquainted 
with Charlemagne (q.v,), King of the Franks and 
later Holy Roman fmpercK, At the request of 
Charlemagne, Akum directed an educational 
program among the franks from 781 to 790, 
thereby exercising an important and lasting in- 
fluence upon the intellec tual life of the Western 
world. In 794 at the count il held at Frankfort he 
led the successful fight against adoptionism 
(q.v.), a heretical belief then dividing the Catho- 
lic Church. After a brief visit to his native coun- 
try, he retyrnecj to France, where he was made 
abbot of fours m 7%. He wrote many letters, 
works on rhetoric, and poems. His letters are 
among the most valuable sources of mformation 
about the social life and humanistic learning of 
Sth-ceniury* France. The impetus given to 
humanistic studies by Akum and his successors 
led not only to a revival of learning, but also to 
the devefopmeni of the Carolmgian, or Caro- 
line, minuscule, a script that influenced the 
handwriting of the Renaissance m Italy and, in- 
directly, the Roman letters of the early Italian 
typesetters, from which modern type is derived;

ALDEN, John (1599?-1687), one of the Pilgrim 
Fathers (qv), born in Southampton, England. 
He came to America on the Mayflower (q v.) in 
1620 and was a signer of the Mayflower Com- 
pact He was one of the founders of Plymouth 
(q.v), the first permanent English settlement in 
New England In 1623 Aldcn married Priscilla 
Mullens (1602?-85?), the daughter of another 
Pilgrim Father. In 1631, together with the Plym- 
outh colonist Myles Standish (q v ), he founded 
Duxbury, where he lived until his death. Alden 
was active m the affairs of Plymouth Colony, 
serving alternately as assistant to the governor 
and as deputy from Duxbury. He lived longer 
than any of the other signers of the Mayflower 
Compact. 

Alden's fame rests chiefly on the romantic 
tale written by the American poet Henry Wads- 
worth Longfellow (q.v.), 'The Courtship of 
Myles Standish'' (1858). In the poem, Alden, 
deeply in love with Priscilla Mullens, suppos- 
edly proposes to her on behalf of his shy friend 
Standish, whereupon she inquires, "Why don't 
you speak for yourself, John?" 

ALDER, any plant of the genus Alnus in the 
Birch family (Betulaceae). The alders are trees or 
shrubs, natives of cold and temperate climates. 
Because the wood resists decay under water it Is 
used for bridge pilings. Dye was formerly ob- 
tained from the bark of many species. The black 
alder, A. glutmosa, is a native of Europe. It 
reaches a height of about 30 to 70 ft. Among the 
varieties of alder used for ornamental planting 
are the golden alder, with bright golden-yellow 
leaves, and the cut-leaved alder, with narrow, 
deeply incised leaves. The gray alder, A mcana, 
has acute leaves, downy underneath but not

ALDER, Kurt (1902-58), German chemist, edu- 
cated at the University of Kiel. Under the guid- 
ance of the German chemist Otto Diels (q v ), 
his chief instructor at Kiel, he specialized in 
diene synthesis (later known also as the Diels- 
Alder reaction), which is essentially the analysis 
and formation of plastics and other similarly 
complex organic compounds As early as 1928 
he and Diels coauthored a paper on this proc- 
ess. In 1934 Alder was appointed professor of 
chemistry at the University of Kiel. He subse- 
quently became professor of chemistry and 
chemical technology at the University of Co-

ALEMBERT, Jean le Rond d' (171 7-6 i). French 
mathematician, philosopher, and encyc lopedist, 
born in Pans. Fie was the illegitimate son of the 
French writer Claudme Ak^xandnne Guerin de 
Tencin (1685-1749), and was left as an infant on 
the steps of the chapel of Saint lean le Rond, 
from which he received his name. He was edu- 
cated at the Coinage Mazarm where he excelled 
in mathematics, physics, and astronomy. At the 


age of twenty-two he wrote his first published 
work, Memoire sur le Calcul Integral (''Report 
on Integral Calculus", 1739), His most important 
scientific work, Tratte de Dynamique ("Treatise 
on Dynamics", 1743), which marks an epoch in 
the science of mechanics, is based on the 
theory known as d'Alembert's principle, discov- 
ered by him at the age of twenty-six, and ex- 
pressed in the proposition The resultant of the 
forces impressed upon a system is equivalent to 
the effective force of the entire system HisRe-

partial differential equations (see Calculus) in 
1749 he proposed the first analytical solution of 
the precession of the equinoxes (see Ecliptic) In 
1751 he became associated with the French en- 
cyclopedist Denis Diderot (q v ) in editing the 
great French Encyclopedia (see Encyclopedia, 
Encyciopldisis), Although he withdrew from the 
editorship m 1758, because of government in-

Cremona, Milan, and Placentia (now Piacenza) 
as a bulwark against Frederick I (q.v.). Holy 
Roman Emperor, who was then attempting to 
subjugate northern Italy It was named in honor 
of Pope Alexander 111 (see under Auxanocr), 
chief opponent of the emperor, and was 
brought into the Lombard League (q v ) Be- 
cause of the strategic position of Alessandria on 
the Tanaro and as the central point of commu- 
nication between Genoa, Turin, and Milan, the 
town has often been a scene of battle. Massimil- 
lano Sforza (1493-1530), Duke of Milan, plun- 
dered Alessandria in 1522. In 1707, after obsti- 
nate resistance, it was taken by the Austrian 
general Eugene (q.v.). Prince of Savoy, during 
the War of the Spanish Succession; see Spanish

lowing year introduced a broad program of so- 
cial and political reform, including the separa- 
tion of church and state, and the direct election 
of the president and vice-president by popular 
vote. Alessandn resigned from the presidency in

ALEXANDER, name of eight popes, the most 
famous of whom were the following 
Alexander HI (d 1181), original name OR- 
LANDO BANDINELLI, pope from 1159 to 1181, 
born in Siena, Italy. He taught and wrote on the 
subject of canon law and in 1159 was chosen to 
succeed Pope Adrian IV (see under Adrian) As 
pope he forced Henry II (q v ), King of England, 
to do public penance for the murder of Thomas 
k Becket (q v ), Archbishop of Canterbury After 
a long struggle with three successive antipopes 
who were supported by Frederick I (q.v.). Holy 
Roman Emperor, Alexander, aided by the Lom- 
bard League (qv.), forced Frederick to recog- 
nize his own elevation to the papacy. Alexander 
Hi wrote the church law requiring the election 
of popes by a two-thirds vote of the cardinals, 
Alexander VI (1431-1503), original name ROD- 
RIGO BORGIA, pope from 1492 to 1503, born 
probably in jltiva, near Valencia, Spam. He was 
adopted into the family of his maternal uncle, 
Pope Callistus III (137S-1458), As Rodrigo Borgia 
he became successively a bishop, a cardinal, 
and an able administrator in the papal court. He 
acquired wealth and lived a life of pleasure 
even after his elevation to the papacy, which he 
secured by bribery in 1492 As pope he recov- 
ered the territories of the Papal States (q.v.), 
which had been ruled by local tyrants, issued a 
papal bull dividing the New World between 
Spam and Portugal, and ordered the execution 
of the Italian church reformer Girolamo Savo- 
narola (q.v.) He greatly increased the fortunes 
of his children principally by the thinly dis- 
guised robbery of nobles and ecclesiastics, a 
number of whom he caused to be assassinated 
or poisoned. 

ALEXANDER HI, known as THE GREAT (356- 
323 BC), King of Macedonia and conqueror of 
the eastern world, born in Pella, the ancient 
capital of Macedonia, the son of Philip II (q.v), 
King of Macedonia, and of Olympias (d. 316 
BC), a princess of Epirus. The Greek philosopher 
Aristotle (q.v.) was Alexander's tutor; he gave 
Alexander a thorough training in rhetoric and 
literature, and stimulated his interest in science, 
medicine, and philosophy. In the summer of 336 
BC Philip was assassinated, and Alexander as- 
cended the Macedonian throne. He found him- 
self surrounded by enemies at home and threat- 
ened by rebellion abroad. Alexander disposed 
quickly of all conspirators and domestic ene- 
mies by ordering their execution. Then he de- 


ALEXANDER III (Macedonia) 

scended upon Thessaly, where partisans of in- 
dependence had gamed ascendancy, and 
restored Macedonian rule Before the end of the 
summer of 336 b c he had reestablished his posi- 
tion m Greece and was elected by a congress of 
states at Corinth As general of the Greeks m a 
campaign against the Persians originally 
planned by his father m 335 BC he carried out a 
successful campaign against the defecting Thra- 
cians, penetrating to the Danube R. On his re- 
turn he crushed m a single week the threatening 
Illyrians, and then hastened to Thebes, which 
had revolted. He took the city by storm and 
razed it, sparing only the temples of the gods 
and the house of the Creek lyric poet Pindar 
(qv), and selling the surviving inhabitants, 
about 8000 m number, into slavery Alexander's 
promptness m crushing the revolt of Thebes 
brought the other Greek states into instant and 
abject submission 

Alexander began his war against Persia in the 
spring of 334 bc by crossing the Hellespont 
(modern Dardanelles) with an army of 35,000 
Macedonian and Greek troops, his chief offi- 
cers, ail Macedonians, included Antigonus, 
Ptolemy, and Seleucus (qq v ). At the river Gran- 
Icus, near the ancient city of Troy, he attacked 
an army of Persians and Greek mercenaries to- 
taling 40,000 men His forces defeated the

enemy and, according to tradition, lost only 110 
men, after this battle, all the states of Asia Minor 
submitted to him In passing through Phrygia he 
IS said to have cut with his sword the Gordian 
knot (q V ), Continuing to advance southward, 
Alexander encountered the mam Persian army, 
commanded by King Darius III (see under Da- 
rius), at Issus, m northeastern Syria The size of 
Darius' army is unknown, the ancient tradition 
that It contained 500,000 men is now considered 
a fantastic exaggeration The Battle of Issus, m 
333 BC, ended in a great victory for Alexander 
Cut off from his base, Darius fled northward, 
abandoning his mother, wife, and children to 
Alexander, who treated them with the respect 
due to royalty Tyre, a strongly fortified seaport, 
offered obstinate resistance, but Alexander took 
It by storm m 332 bc after a siege of seven 
months Alexander captured Gaza next and then 
passed on into Egypt, where he was greeted as a 
deliverer. By these successes he secured control 
of the entire eastern Mediterranean coastline. 
Later in 332 BC he founded, at the mouth of the 
Nile R., the city of Alexandria, which later be- 
came the literary, scientific, and commercial 
center of the Greek world Gyrene, the capital of 
the ancient North African kingdom of Cyrena- 
ica, submitted to Alexander soon afterward, ex- 
tending his dominion to Carthaginian territory 
In the spring of 531 b.c Alexander made a pil- 
grimage to the great temple and oracle of 
Amen-Ra, Egyptian god of the sun, whom the 
Greeks identified with Zeus. The earlier Egyp- 
tian pharaohs were believed to be sons of 
Amen-Ra; and Alexander, the new ruler of 
Egypt, wanted the god to acknowledge him as 
his son. The pilgrimage apparently was success- 
ful, and it may have confirmed in him a belief in 
his own divine origin. Turning northward again, 
he reorganized his forces at Tyre and started for 
Babylon with an army of 40,000 infantry and 
7000 cavalry. Crossing the Euphrates and the 
Tigris rivers, he met Darius at the head of an 
army of unknown size, which, according to the 
exaggerated accounts of antiquity, was said to 
number 1,000,000 men, this army he completely 
defeated in the Battle of Arbela (q.v.) on the 
plain of Guagamela, on Oct. 1, 331 bc Darius 
fled as he had done at Issus, and was later slam 
by two of his own generals. Babylon surren- 
dered after Caugamela, and the city of Susa 
with Its enormous treasures was soon con- 
quered Then, m mid-winter, he forced his way 
to Persepolis, the Persian capital. After plun- 
dering the royal treasuries and taking other rich 
booty he burned the city and thus completed 
the destruction of the ancient Persian Empire. 


ALEXANDER III (Macedonia) 

His domain now extended along and beyond 
the southern shores of the Caspian Sea, includ- 
ing modern Afghanistan and Baluchistan, and 
northward into Bactria and Sogdiana, the mod- 
ern Russian Turkestan, now called Soviet Cen- 
tral Asia It had taken Alexander only three 
years, from the spring of 330 bc to the spring of 
327 BC, to master this vast area 

In order to complete his conquest of the rem- 
nants of the Persian empire, which had once in- 
cluded part of western India, Alexander crossed 
the Indus R in 326 bc, and invaded the Punjab 
as far as the river Hyphasis (modern Beas), at 
this point the Macedonians rebelled and re- 
fused to go farther Alexander then constructed 
a fleet and passed down the Indus, reaching its 
mouth in September, 325 bc The fleet sailed 
thence to the Persian Gulf With his army, he re- 
turned overland across the desert to Media 
Shortages of food and water caused severe 
losses and hardship among his troops Alexan- 
der spent about a year organizing his dominions 
and completing a survey of the Persian Gulf in 
preparation for further conquests He arrived m 
Babylon m the spring of 323 ac The following 
June he contracted a fever and died He left his 
empire, in his own words, "to the strongest", 
this ambiguous testament resulted m dire con- 
flicts for half a century 
Alexander was one of the greatest generals of 
all time, noted for his brilliance as a tactician 
and troop leader and for the rapidity with which 
he could traverse great expanses of territory He 
was usually brave and generous, but could be 
ruthless when politics demanded. At times he 
was cruel, having, for example, killed his friend 
Clitus (d. 328 B.c) in a drunken fury. He later re- 
gretted this act deeply As a statesman and ruler 
his plans were grandiose; according to many 
modern historians he cherished a scheme for 
uniting the East and the West m a world empire, 
a new and enlightened "world brotherhood of 
all men". He trained thousands of Persian 
youths m Macedonian tactics and enrolled them 
in his army He himself adopted Persian man- 
ners and married Eastern wives, namely, Roxana, 
daughter of Oxyartes of Sogdiana, and Barsme 
(or Stateira), the elder daughter of Darius, and 
he encouraged and bribed his officers to take 
Persian wives. Shortly before he died Alexander 
ordered the Greek cities to worship him as a 
god Though he probably gave the order for po- 
litical reasons, he was, in his own view and that 
of hiS contemporaries, of divine birth. In any 
case, the order was largely nullified by his death 
shortly after he issued it

ALEXANDER, name of three' emperors of Russia 
Alexander I (1 777-182S), imperor { 1801 son 
of Emperor Paul ! (17S4-i80]}. He ahohsht'd 
many barbarous and cruel punishments then in 
use, and in 1802 introduced a more orderly ad 
ministration of government by the creation of 
eight ministries. He improved the condition of 
the serfs (see SERfOOM), and promoted educa 
tion, doubling the number of Russian universi- 
ties by establishing those at Saint Petersburg 
(now Leningrad), Khar'kov, and Kazan' Alexan 
der was for a time the ally of Prussia against Na 
poleon I (q.v.), Cmperor of France. In 1807, how 
ever, after the? battles of Eyiau and Fnedlamk 
Alexander allied hirnsoll with Napoleon. He 
broke the alliance with Napoleon in 1812, In the* 
same year Napoleon invadc'd Russia, only to 
lose his army in a disastrous retreat from Mos 
cow AlexaneJer was prominent thereafter in the 
European coalition that fed to Napoleon's fall 
In 1815 Alexander instituted the Holy Alliame 
(q v ) of Austria, Russia, and Prussia, The pur- 
pose of the alliance, as it was conceived, was u> 
achieve the realization of high Christian ideals 
among the nations of Europe; the alliance, how 
ever, soon ceased to have any real importance 
in European politics. The last years of Alexan- 
der's life and reign were reactionary and des- 
potic. He was succeeded by his brother Nicho- 
las 1 (q.v.). 

Alexander 11 (181B-8I), Emperor (1855-81), son 
of Nicholas i (q.v.), Empc'ror of Russia, and 
nephew of Alexander 1. He ascenefed the throne 
during the Crimean War (q.v.), and in 1856 
signed the Treaty of Pans, which brought the 
hostilities to an end {see Russia* 7 he kusstan 
Empire), After establishing committees to study 
the need for rcTorm, Alexander II abolished serf 
dom throughout Russia. He also abolished cor- 
poral punishment, established local self-govern- 
ment, initiated ludicial reform, revised the 
educational system, and developed a system of 
universal military servic€\ Under his rule the ad- 
ministration of the police was greatly improved

ALEXANDER, WILLIAM 

ford He gave up a fellowship at Oxford to study 
psychology in Germany (1890-91) because he 
felt the need to relate philosophy with the new 
discoveries in experimental psychology He is 
one of the few philosophers of the 20th century 
to develop a comprehensive metaphysical sys- 
tem The basic tenets of this system are ex- 
pressed in his major work, Space, Time, and 
Deity (1920). Space-time is the cosmic system 
from which different categories of existence are 
evolving in an infinite series The primary cate- 
gories are matter, life, and mind Alexander 
found the cosmic order tending toward an end, 
which he termed Deity Mind, one of the pri- 
mary categories, is endowed with the unique 
property of consciousness, through which it 
may achieve Deity Within the context of this 
system, Alexander dealt with traditional philo- 
sophical problems, such as the relation of mind 
and body, moral values, and the nature of 
knowledge In his later years, he became inter- 
ested in aesthetics, with which Beauty and 
Other Forms of Value (1933) is concerned Alex- 
ander was awarded the British Order of Merit in 
1930

granted him a huge tract of land m America, in- 
cluding the region comprising the present-day 
Nova Scotia and Newfoundland (qqv). Al- 
though Charles I (qv.). King of England, later 
confirmed the grant, the territory was ceded to 
France in 1632. Alexander became secretary of 
state for Scotland in 1626 and served in that post 
until his death. He was raised to the peerage m 
1630 

His principal works include the collection of

having been lost, there appeared about 200 ad 
under his name a Greek story (sometimes re-

city was founded in 332 bc by Alexander IN 
(qv), known as Alexander the Great, King of 
Macedonia, who had planned it as one of the 
finest ports of the ancient world A mole nearly 
a mile in length called the Heptastadion ('"seven

considered one of the Seven Wonders of the 
World (q v ), was also built on Pharos Another,

The ancient city was about 4 mi long, and 
regularly built, with streets crossing at right an- 
gles and colonnades adorning the principal 
streets. The most magnificent quarter of the 
city, called the Brucheium, was situated on the

with Greek learning, profoundlv^ influencing the 
later religious thought of the world, hero the 
Greek translation ot the Old Testament, called 
the Septuagmt (bee Bibie, Versions of the), was 
made before 100 ad Later philosophers at- 
tempted to fuse the doctrines ot Chnstianitv 
with Creek philosophy, 

Soon after the city was founded, the popula- 
tion, consisting chiefly of Greeks, Jews, and 
Egyptians, numbered 300,000 tree citizens, ex- 
clusive of slaves and strangers. Alexandria was 
made the capital of Egypt, numerous palaces 
were built by the Ptolemies, the Alexandrian Li- 
brary (q V ) and Museum were founded, and in- 
fluential schools of philosophy, rhetoric, and 
other branches of ancient learning were estab- 
lished (see Alexandrian Ace) Under the Ptoie- 
mies the city became the literary and scientific 
center of the ancient world. After the defeat of 
Cleopatra, Queen of Egypt, at Actium in bc 
and her suicide the following year, the city 
came under the rule of Octavian, later the 
Roman emperor Augustus (q.v.), and was gov 
erned by a prefect appointed by him Its posi- 
tion made it the center of commerce between 
East and West, and fleets of grain ships sailed 
from Alexandria to Italy year after year Gradu 
ally, however, the city lost its prosperity. A Jew- 
ish revolt in 116 ad resulted m the annihilation 
of the Jewish population and the destruction ot 
a large portion of the city. In 21. S the Roman em 
peror Caracalla (q v.) ordered a massacre o1 the 
male inhabitants of the entire city for reasons 
that remain obscure, but may have been a pun- 
ishment for some form of seditious conduct. 
The founding of Constantinople {now istanbul; 
q.v.) further eclipsed the Egyptian metropolis. 
The Muslims, under the general Amr ibn-al-As 
(594?-664) besieged, captured, and almost de- 
stroyed the city in 638 and again about 646. 
Under Muslim rule the city declined, particu- 
larly after the rise of Cairo after about 96$. The 
opening of the sea route to India in the ISth 
century also contributed to the decline of the 
city, further reducing its importance as a trade 
center. Alexandria was captured and held from 
1798 to 1801 by the French emperor Napoleon I 
(q v.). 

The modern city is situated mainly on a pen- 
insula about the mole, reaching to and includ- 
ing the island of Pharos, and on the portion of 
the mainland immediately s. of the f harbor. 
The part of the modern city on the peninsula is 
a characteristicly Egyptian town; the European 
quarter is on the mainland. Alexandria has had, 
since ancient times, two harbors, of which the 
w. one is the chief commercial center and the

marily by scholarship rath«*r than by inspiration. 
Alexandrian |KH*ms were* usually short, and the 
chief sublet ts were mytho'logy ami human emo- 
tion. Noted Alexandrian poc^ts were Callimachus 
(q.v.), the author of hymns and epigrams; Apol-

and lycophron (fl. Ird century sc). 

During the Ptolemaic period the intellectjua! 
activity of Alexandria mclydcni also a school of 
literary scholarship, m which the study of philol- 
ogy, grammar, prosody, lexicography, and liter- 
ary criticism flourished. These subjects, together 
with geography, mafhemaocs, astronomy, and 
medicine dominated the prose of the period. 

At this time the sciences of mathematics and

ALEXIS I MIKHAILOVICH 


astronomy also flourished The most important 
Greek mathematicians m the pre-Christian pe- 
riod were Euclid, Apollonius of Perga, Eratos- 
thenes, Aristarchus of Samos, Hipparchus, Hero 
of Alexandria, and Archimedes (qq v ) In the 
fields of pure and applied sciences the Alexan- 
drian Age achieved much For example, Aristar- 
chus wrote on the size and distance of the sun 
and the moon and believed that the earth re- 
volved around the sun, Euclid composed the 
first systematic treatise on geometry, Archi- 
medes applied mathematics to hydrostatics, 
Apollonius of Perga wrote the first systematic 
treatise on conic sections, Eratosthenes calcu- 
lated the circumference of the earth and de- 
vised a calendar that became the basis of the Ju- 
lian calendar, and Hipparchus determined 
within SIX minutes the length of the solar year 
After the fall of the Ptolemaic dynasty, al- 
though literary activity was centered m Rome, 
the museum, libraries, and schools of Alexandria 
continued to make it an influential intellectual 
center The schools of philosophy in particular 
prospered, including schools of Christian theol- 
ogy as well as of Neoplatonism (q v ), which 
originated at Alexandria early m the 3rd century 
AD The interest in sc lence continued, and in the 
2nd century ad Claudius Ptolernaeus, better 
known as Ptolemy (q.v.), devised a system of as- 
tronomy and geography based on the earth as 
the center of the cosmos With the Muslim con- 
quest of the c ity in 641 ad, Alexandria ceased to 
be a center of Occidental learning

ALEXANDRIAN LIBRARY, famous ancient li- 
brary of Alexandria, Egypt. Founded by Ptolemy 
I Soter {see under ProtfMY), King of Egypt, it was 
expanded by his son Ptolemy II Philadelphus 
into the greatest collection of books in the an- 
cient world early m the ird century s.C. The 
scholars in charge included the ablest Alexan- 
drian men of letters of the period. Zenodotus 
(3rd century b.c) of Ephesus, whose specialty 
was the classification of poetry, was the first to 
hold the position of librarian. The poet Callima- 
chus made the first general catalogue of the 
books, and apparently was also librarian. The 
two most noted librarians were Aristophanes 
of Byzantium (257?-1S0? s.c) and Aristarchus 
(220?-150? B,c.) of Samothrace, both great edi- 
tors and grammarians. In the time of Ptolemy II, 
according to one historian, the main library in 
the Alexandrian Museum contained nearly 500,- 
000 volumes, or rolls, and an annex in the Tem- 
ple of Serapis contained some 43,000 volumes. 


Most of the writings of antiquity were preserved 
in these collections, from which copies were 
made and disseminated to libraries throughout 
the civilized world 

It IS largely through such copies that ancient 
works have survived to modern times, for the 
Alexandrian Library was partially or wholly de- 
stroyed on several occasions. In 47 bc, during 
the civil war between the Roman statesman 
Gaius Julius Caesar and the followers of Pompey 
the Great, Caesar was besieged in Alexandria, a 
fire that destroyed the Egyptian fleet spread 
through some stores of books, about 40,000 of 
which were ruined A few years later the Roman 
emperor Marcus Antonius (Mark Antony) pre- 
sented to Cleopatra, Queen of Egypt, books of 
the library of the city of Pergamum (q v ), in Asia 
Minor According to legend, the library at Alex- 
andria was burned three times* in 272 ad (by 
order of the Roman emperor Lucius Domitius 
Aurelianus), in 391 ad (under the Roman em-

ALEXANDRINE, in verse, a line of twelve syl- 
lables constituting six iambic feet. When the 
end rhyme is feminine, the line contains thir- 
teen syllables See Versification The name is 
considered by some scholars to derive from a 
12th-century French collection of romances 
concerning the Macedonian conqueror Alexan- 
der ill (q v ), known as the Great (see Alexander 
Legend) For centuries the Alexandrine was little 
used in French verse and had no regular pauses. 
It first became popular in the 16th century in 
the work of Pierre de Ronsard (q.v.) The Alex- 
andrine soon became accepted as the standard 
line in heroic verse for epic narrative, tragedy, 
and high comedy, and as a result the pauses 
were more strictly regulated. It remained 
preeminent in French verse until the middle of 
the 19th century. 

The Alexandrine has been used in English 
verse primarily as a variation within a pattern of 
decasyllabic lines, as m the Spenserian stanza 
(see Spenser, Edmund) and m the heroic couplets 
of the English poets John Dryden and Alexander 
Pope (qq.v), Polyolbion (1622) by the English 
poet Michael Drayton (qv.) is the only impor- 
tant long poem in English which is written ex- 
clusively in Alexandrines.

the throne during a Danish invasion. Although 
Alfred succeeded in making peace with the 
Danes, five years later their marauding expedi- 
tions began again, and by early 878 they were 
successful almost everywhere. About Easter of 
878, however, Alfred established himself at 
Athelney and began assembling an army. In the 
middle of the year he defeated the Danes and 
captured their stronghold, probably at present- 
day Edington in Wiltshire For the next fourteen

internal affairs of his kingdom. By 886 he had 
captured the city of London and soon after he 
was recognized as the king of all England In 893

ALGAE, common name for primitive phyla of 
organisms that are capable of photosynthesis 
(q.v.) but have little or no differentiation into 
tissue systems. The best known forms occur as 
seaweeds and pond scum. Algae are the most 
ancient form of life capable of photosynthesis; 
blue-green algae identical to forms living today 
have been found in fossil deposits 3.1 billion 
years old in the Fig Tree Formation of South Al- 
rtca.

irig point. Cenam red algae grow at ocean 
depths as great as 18 ft, 

In size, algae vary from imy unicellular forms 
visible only under a microscope to such giant 
forms as the kelp Pelagophycus, which can grow 
200 ft. in a year. Microscopic algae that float in 
the ocean are part of the phytoplankton— the 
main food source, either directly or indirectly, 
for most marine animats, Plankton. 

Man has used algae for centuries as food; 
principal sources Include the brown kelps— 
known in japan as kombu— and certain red al- 
gae {Porphyn} and green algae (Ulva, the sea 
lettuce). Commercially important products in- 
clude alginates, which are gelatinous extracts of 
the cell walls of brown alpe. Alginates are used 
in ice cream to give it a creamy texture and to 
prevent the formation of tee crystals. They are 
also used m paints to prevent the settling out of 
pigment particles, The red alga Celidium is a 
source of agar, which is used in many indus- 
tries— for example, in making soups, sauces, and 
jellies— and In bacteriological laboratories, 
where it is used to solidify media used to grow 
microorganisms. 

Bltie-Greeti Alpe. The blue-green alpe are 
found in both salt and fresh waters. They can 
grow at temperatures higher than those toler- 
ated by any other orpnism and can endure ex- 
treme dryness and high light Intensity. The pig- 
ment phycocyanin is responsible for the deep 
peen or blue-green color of many species. Blue-

green algae occur as single cells, colonies, or 
filaments. They reproduce by cell division See 
Cyanophyta 

Green Algae. The Chlorophyta is the largest of 
the algal phyla. Green algae are most abundant 
in fresh water (often visible as pond scums), but 
also inhabit salt water and terrestrial environ- 
ments. They may exist as single cells, colonies, 
filaments, or plates of cells. Most species form 
motile reproductive cells (zoospores) that de- 
velop directly into new plants Various types of 
sexual reproduction occur, and many species 
exhibit alternation of generations (q v ) See 
Chlorophyta. 

Brown Atgae. Most species of the phylum 
Phaeophyta are marine. Known as seaweeds, 
they grow mainly in the shallow waters of the 
sea in temperate regions. These are the largest of 
the algae and the most highly differentiated in 
structure. Many species form zoospores that in 
turn form microscopic structures called gameto- 
phytes, which produce sperm and eggs The col- 
or of brown algae is due to pigments called xan- 
thophylls, which mask the color of the 
chlorophylls. Common seaweeds are the kelps 
(see Kelp), the sea palm, and the sea-otter's cab- 
bage. Most large species are attached to the 
ocean bottom by a long, thick stalk Culfweeds 
of the genus Sargassum are found as masses of 
free-floating algae on the Sargasso Sea of the 
North Atlantic Ocean. The brown algae are a 
source of fertilizer, vitamins, iodine, and food. 
Red Algae. Most red algae are marine and 
grow In the deeper waters of subtropical seas. 
The vegetative body of these organisms is small 
and delicate. Their color is imparted by the pig- 
ment phycoerythrin, which obscures the color

of the chlorophylls. Some species secrete lime, 
which they take from seawater, forming lime- 
stone deposits that play an important role m the 
formation of coral reefs. The so-called Irish 
moss (Chondrus cmpus). long used for food, is 
a red alga that grows off the coasts of Great 
Britain, Ireland, and North America. See

ALGARDI, Alessandro (1602-54), Italian 
sculptor and architect, born in Bologna. He 
studied painting under the Bolognese painter 
Lodovico Carracci (see under Carracci), but 
later turned to sculpture. In 1640 he became 
head of the Academy of Saint Luke and subse- 
quently executed such marble groups as "Samt 
Philip Neri and the Angel" for the Church of 
Santa Maria m Rome and "Beheading of Sami 
Paul" for the Church of San Paolo in Bologna 
Named court sculptor m 1644, he designed the 
Villa Doria-Pamfili and a large bronie statue of 
Pope Innocent X for the Paazo dei Conservato- 
rei, both in Rome. In 1650 he completed the 
tomb of Pope Leo XI (1535-1605) and a huge 
bas-relief at the base of the altar of Saint Leo in 
Samt Peter's basilica, Rome, representing the re- 
treat from Rome of the warrior Aitiia (q.v ) Al 
gardi is considered one of the foremost Italian 
sculptors of the baroque (q.v.) school.

ALGEBRA, branch of mathematics in which 
computations are performed with variables, 
usually designated by letters, which stand for 
unspecified numbers in the arithmetic opera- 
tions of addition and multiplication (qq.v.). In 
modern technology, the word algebra refers to 
what is commonly called modem or abstract al- 
gebra. 

In its classic and most common use algebra 
refers to the study of methcxis of manipulating 
algebraic expressions. For instance, the disci- 
pline simplifies algebraic expressions, as in the 
following example:

Also included are the study of negative mwn-

nations (q V.), the theory of equations (see 
tQUAtioNS Thu>rs tri), partial fractions, inequali- 
ties, and determinants (see DtiiRMiNSNr). See 
MAIHIMAUtS TjRMSIN 

An imfKrriant feature of algebra which distin- 
guishes It from other branches of mathematics 
such as calculus (qv) is that all expressions 
considered in algebra must contain only a (mite 
number ert terms and fac tors, and the computa- 
tion must terminate after a (mite number of op- 
erations The notion of limit is not an algebraic 
one, nor are prex esses in vshich the limit is in- 
volvcxf, for example, derivative, integral, and in- 
finite senes 

In mociern or absirac I algebra, the mathemati- 
cian deals not with the sums and products of 
numbers, or letters which stand for numbers, 
but with sums and products of abstract ele- 
ments. assuming only that such sums or prod- 
ucts obey c ertam basic laws or axioms In other 
words, rwidern algebra is Ihe study of the struc- 
ture of systems consisting of a set of elements 
and a set of operations that saiisfy certain ax- 
ioms A simple example of sue h a structure is a 
group A group is a set C of elements, denoted 
by a,b,c. , together with a single operatiem 
denoted by a ccmvenieni symbol such as an as- 
terisk (*). satisfying the followmg (our axioms. 

1) If a ar^ fa are eleim-nts of the set C, then 
so IS a * fa This IS called the axiom of clo- 
sure. 

2) If a, fa, and c are elements of the set C, 
then It is true that (a* fa) *r » a* (fa* c). This 
axiom asserts that the operatiem denoted 
by * IS associative, that is, the result does 
not depend on the order in which the op- 
eratkxns are performed. 

3) Tfiere exists a di«Einguished elemeni of C, 
denoted by e, having the property that a * e

bra, for example; semigroups, loops, rings, inte- 
gral domains, fields, lattices, modules. Boolean 
algebras, and linear algebras. 

Both classic al algel>ra and modern algebra are 
used extensively in all other branches of mathe- 
matics For example, when geometry is studied 
from an algebraic viewpoint the result is ana- 
lytic geometry (q.v.) A partial list of other hy- 
brid subjects which have arisen by combining 
algebra with other branches of mathematics 
might include algebraic topology, functional 
analysis, and Lie algebras. 

The oldest Western treatise on algebra dates 
from the 3rd century ad, written by Oiophantus 
(q.v.), a Greek mathematician of Alexandria. Eu- 
ropeans became acquainted with algebra 
through Latin translations of the Arab mathema- 
ticians, chiefly al-Khwarizmi (780-850?), whose 
work was translated into Latin in the 12th cen- 
tury. The first Renaissance treatise on algebra 
was written by the Italian mathematician and 
Minorite friar Luca Pactoio (1450? -1520?) in 
1494. The Italian mathematician Scipione del 
Ferro (1465-1526) derived the solution of one 
case of cubic equations about 1505, and the Ital- 
ian mathematician Niccold Tartaglia (1500?-57) 
derived the general solution in 1541. The French 
philosopher ar>d scientisl Ren6 Descartes (q.v.) 
applied algebra to geometry in 1637 and was the 
first to represent the nature of curves by means 
of equations, thus creating analytic geometry. 

Mcidern algebra began m the early 19th cen- 
tury with the work of the French mathemati- 
cians loseph Louis Lagrange (q.v.) and Evariste 
Galois (1811-32), the Norwegian mathematician 
Niels Henrik Atel (q.v.), and many others. Ab- 
stract algebra continues to be an area of active 
research among mathematicians. 

ALGEBRAIC SYSTEMS, in mathematics, sets 
in which the elements can be combined by one 
or two basic binary operations according to 
specified rules. The operation of ordinary addi- 
tion, as in 2 4- 3, acts on two numbers and is 
therefore called a binary operation. The opera- 
tion v^ 4 » 2 acts on only one number and Is 
therefore a unary operation. Arithmetic (q.v.) is 
the nnosi common algebraic system in which 
the elements, In this case the ordinary numbers, 
can be combined by addition artd multipitca- 
tion (qq.v.) using the usual well-krtown rules. 
The operations of subtraction and division 
(qq.v.) aie defined in terms of addition and are 
therefcNre not considered basic In this context. 

Assume that S Is a set, infinite or finite, and 
that a, b, c, ... are representative triwnmnts; for 
»cample, S may be a set in which the elemente 
are the whole numbers, comblnaWe under the

usual binary operation of addition In each case 
It is assumed that S contains at least two distinct 
elements. Assume also that • and® designate two 
binary operations, the operation • may be 
thought of as analogous to addition, and ® to 
multiplication. The following laws are stated, 
but no single algebraic system obeys all of them' 
Small letters, representing elements, are mem- 
bers of S. 

(1) a • 6 is a unique element of S 

(2) (a • b) • c - a • (6 * c). 

(3) a • b - fa • a. 

(4) There exist elements 2 ' and of S such 
that for any element a, a»z' — z"*a»-a 

(5) Corresponding to an element a, there

(6) Corresponding to elements a and b, there 
exists an element c of S such that a • c — b. 

(7) Corresponding to elements a and b, there 
exists an element d of S such that d • a - b. 

(8) a o b is a unique element of S 

(9) (aofa) 0 c - a® (b ®c) 

(10) a °b - b ®a.

equal to / or z" of rule (5), there exist elements

(14) (b • c) ® a » (b ® a) • (c ® a). 

(15) a • (b o c) - (a * fa) ® (a » c). 

06) Corresponding to an element a, there ex- 
ists an element a, such that a • a = a, — 

1 /. Note the parallels between rules (1), (2), (3), 
(4), (5), (13) and rules (8), (9), (10), (11), (12), (15). 
Algebraic Systems with One Operation. An 
algebraic system that satisfies rule (1) is called a 
groupoid ora multiplicative system, although* is 
sometimes similar to addition; a system that 
satisfies (1) and (2) is called a semigroup; and 
one that satisfies (1), (2), and (4) is called a 
monoid. A quasigroup satisfies (1), (6), and (7); 
a loop satisfies (1), (4), (6), and (7). A group 
satisfies (1), (2), (4), and (5), or equivalently (1), 
(2), (6), and (7). An abelian or commutative 
group, named for the Norwegian mathematician 
Niels Henrik Abel (q.v.), satisfies (3). 

Groups were invented by the French mathe- 
matician Ivariste Galois (1811-32) to help in 
studying polynomial equations (see Equations, 
Th«ORY Of); group theory has since become an 
important and basic tool in almost every branch 
of pure and applied mathematics. 

Algebraic Systems with Two Operations. 
The ordinary real numbers form what is called a 
field, which is an algebraic system satisfying (1),

ALGECIRAS 


(2), (3), (4), (5), (8), (9), (10), (11), (12), and (13) 
A ring IS an algebraic system that satisfies (1), 
(2), (3), (4), {51 (8), (% (13), and (14). A commu- 
tative ring IS one that satisfies (10); a ring with 
an identity, or unit element, is a ring that satis- 
fies (11). ft can be shown that m such a ring, for 
example, / z" - 2 or t/ - u" -* u, z and u 
are unique. A ring with an identity is a division 
ring if It satisfies (12). A field, therefore, is a 
commutative division ring. A commutative ring 
with an identity is an integral domain, or do- 
main of integrity, rf ^ z implies that at 
least one of a and b is z. 

In rings and fields, z, u,* and ® are usually des- 
ignated by the more common 0, 1, -f, and x. 
The expression a »ib or a x b is frequently ab- 
breviated to ab. Rings and fields, like groups, are 
important in many iDranches of mathematics. 

Boolean algebra (q.v.), an algebraic system 
that satisfies (1), (2), (3), (4), (8), (9), (10), (11), 
(13), (15), and (16), is another important alge- 
braic system. It is useful in the study of sets, 
mathematical logic, computer science, and 
electric circuitry. In Boolean algebra, 
U and n usually replace * and . l•Sl. 

ALGECIRAS, city and seaport of Spain, m 
Cidlz Province, on Algeciras Bay, about 6 miles 
w. of Gibraltar. The city is a popular resort area 
because of the mild winters and m^arby beaches 
and mineral springs. It serves as a port city for 
the surrounding agricultural region, which pro- 
duces cereals, tobacco, and livestock. The mafor 
industries of the port city are fishing and the 
processing of cork. The present city was 
founded on the ruins of a Moorish city in 1704 
by Spanish refugees from Gibraltar, when the 
promontory was captured by a combined British 
and Dutch force. The ruins of a Moorish aque- 
duct are still evident nearby. Algeciras was the 
site of a famous naval battle in 1801, in which 
the British fleet defeated the combined French 
and Spanish forces, and of the Algeciras Confer- 
ence held in 1906 to settle the dispute of the Eu- 
ropean powers over Morocco. Pop. (1970)

than one hyn<Jf€?d such works, most of which 
were issued as dime novels. He devoted the 
profits from the sale of his books, which sold 
millions of copies, to the improvement of con- 
ditions among the street urchins of New York. 
Although of little literary significance, his novels 
inflyenced American youth by emphasizing 
merit, rather than birth or background, as the 
chief determinant of success, His other writings

ALGERIA |Fr. AlfArie), officially Democratic 
and Popular Rei^blic of Algeria, republic of 
North Africa; bounded on the m by the Mediter- 
ranean Sea, on the f by Tunisia and lifc^a, on 
the s by Niger, Mali, and Mauritania, and on the 
w. by Morocco. The country lies between about 
lat. 19^ N. and lai. 37* H. and long. W. and 
long. 12^ I. Its total area is 919,353 sq. ml. 

me lANO 

Algeria has three main topographical zones. The 
most arable secticMn of the country is the Tell, a 
hilly region eittemling from SO to 13® nil. inland' 


406 


ALGERIA 


from the Mediterranean coast The zone to the 
s and sw of the Tell consists of extensive up- 
lands, mainly spurs and ranges of the Atlas 
Mountains (qv.). The third zone, occupying 
more than 90 percent of the country, lies within 
the Sahara (q v.) Desert Saline lakes are numer- 
ous m the N part of Algeria The principal river 
IS the Chitiff, about 450 mi. long. 

Climate. The climate of n Algeria, modified 
by oceanic influences, is humid and relatively 
cool (averaging about 77® F) in summer, and 
mild (averaging about 52® F.) m winter In this 
region, precipitation averages from 20 to 40 in. 
annually In the Algerian Sahara, summer tem- 
peratures average about 95® F., and winter tem- 
peratures, which often fall below the freezing 
point, average about 40® F. 

Natural Resources. Most of the wealth of Al- 
geria lies in its mineral deposits, notably crude 
petroleum, natural gas, and iron ore. The arable 
land, only about one eighth of the area of the 
country, is mainly in the coastal regions. 

Plants and Animals. Pines, evergreens, and 
oak trees predominate in Algerian forests; and 
cork, oak, and cedars are also found in abun- 
dance. Extensive tracts of brushwood and espar- 
to grass are found in the hilly areas. The Sahara 
regions of the country contain the usual desert 
vegetation, the most important of which is the 
date palm. 

Scavengers, such as jackals, hyenas, and vul- 
tures, are found throughout much of the land 
Most jungle creatures, such as the lion and ele- 
phant, have vanished, although the ostrich and 
monkey can still be found. In some areas, ante- 
lope roam freely, stalked by a small number of 
panthers. Desert fauna include scorpions and a 
variety of reptiles. 

Soils. Rich soils are rare in Algeria. The most 
fertile lands, located in the Tell region nearest 
the coast, are relatively poor in humus. The 
plains have considerable alluvial deposits, but 
the uplands are more barren and can support 
only grasses and weeds that are suitable for 
grazing. 

THE PEOPLE 

The population consists largely of Berbers or of 
persons of mixed Arab-Berber stock. Until 1962 
about 1,000,(X)0 European settlers, mainly 
French, lived in Algeria; 90 percent of this 
group, however, emigrated when Algeria be- 
came mdepertdent in 1%2, The population is 
chiefly rural, the majority living in villages and 
on small farms. 

Popiilatiofi. The population of Algeria (census 
1966) vms 12,101,994; the United Nations esti- 
mated fl977) 17,910,000. The overall popularlon 


density is about 19 persons per sq mi (1977 U N 
est ) 

Political Divisions. Algeria is divided into 13 
Wilayas. These are subdivided into 691 local 
communes. 

Principal Cities Algiers (q v ) is the capital, 
chief seaport, and largest city (pop, 1973 est., 
1,200,000) Other important cities and towns are 
Oran (325,000), the trading town, and Constan- 
tine (254,000), the center for a livestock- and 
wheat-producing region 
Language and Religion. Arabic is the official 
language French, however, is still widely read 
and spoken. The official religion, Islam, is fol- 
lowed by most Algerians More than 150,000 
persons are Jewish, and the remainder are 
mostly Roman Catholic. 

Education. Primary education is compulsory 
for all children under the age of fifteen, and 
about 80 percent receive primary education The 
Algerian educational system, long patterned af- 
ter the French, was changed to a program of 
Arabization shortly after independence was ob- 
tained, The government introduced new teach- 
ing methods and began training natives and 
bringing in foreign. Arabic-speaking teachers. In 
1976 all private schools were abolished. 
Elementary and Secondary Schools. In the 
mid-1970's, according to the latest available sta- 
tistics, some 2,640,000 pupils attended primary 
schools and about 500,000 were enrolled in sec- 
ondary schools The government also maintains 
vocational and teacher-training schools. 
Universities and Colleges, Algeria has four 
universities, with a total enrollment of about 
30,000 students. The University of Algiers, 
founded in 1879, has, in the mid-1970's, faculties 
of law, medicine, science, and liberal arts. Al- 
giers Scientific and Technological Institute, m 
Algiers, Constantine University, m Constantine, 
and Oran University, m Oran, have all been 
founded since 1%5. 

CULTURE 

French tradition still dominates the cultural life 
of Algeria. In the 20th century, however, a 
movement has grown among the Algerian artists 
and intellectuals to revive national interest in 
Arab-Berber origins. 

Libraries and Museums. Foremost among Al- 
gerian libraries is the National Library m Algiers, 
which has about 700,000 volumes, including im- 
portant works on African subjects Collections 
are maintained by the University of Algiers, 
which has about 600,000 volumes, and by the 
Murticipal Library in Constantine, which con- 
tains about 25,000 volumes. 

The Prehistory and Ethnographic Museum, 

407 



ALGERIA 



the National Museum of Antiquities, and the 
National Museum of Algiers are located in Al* 
giers. The Gustave Mercier Museum in Constan- 
tine contains art and archeological collections. 
Archeology. Several traces of prehistoric man 
have been found in Algeria. Frescoes dating 
from the Neolithic period were discovered In 
the mountains of the Sahara region of Tassili n' 
Ajjer. Many relics from Phoenician, Creek, and 
Roman periods have been unearthed through- 
out the country. 

Literature. Although much Algerian writing 
was suppressed by the Frertch during the ISStys, 
the war for independence stimulated a consid- 
erable resurgence of interest in national litera- 
ture. Noted 20th-century Algerian writers are the 
novelist Kateb Yasin, tlW playwright Mohamed 
Dib, and the poet Mark Hadad. The novelist, 
playwright, and critic Albert Camus (q.v,) was 
born and educated in Algeria.

Forest and Fishing Industries State forests 
cover about 1,400,000 acres lumber is used for 
heating and industrial needs Bark is cut for tan- 
ning, and cork for commercial purposes Char- 
coal, made from charred wood, is also used for 
fuel 

Fishing IS an important industry, m the mld- 
1970's the total catch was about 37,000 metric 
tons The bulk of the yield included sardines, 
anchovies, sprats, tuna, and shellfish 
Mining and Manufacturing* The chief min- 
eral products are crude oil and natural gas from 
the Sahara Oil production, which had been in- 
creasing, stabilized in the mid-1970^s at about 
47,000,000 metric tons a year 

Other major mineral products are iron ore 
and pyrites, coal, zinc, lead, and copper More 
than 500,000/XX) tons of phosphates are thought 
to exist in hilly regions of Djebel Onk m the 
north Almost all mining and industrial activity 
IS state-controlled Most of the industry is cen- 
tered around the cities of Algiers and Oran Ma- 
jor products are carpets and textiles, diemicals, 
refined petroleum, natural construction ma- 


terials, olive oil, wine, and processed tobaccc 
Currency and Banking The chief monetar^r 
unit of Algeria is the dinar (4 03 dinars equal 
US$1,1978) All government banking and 
monetary functions are carried out by the Cen- 
tral Bank of Algeria 

Commerce and Trade The principal Algerian 
exports are petroleum, natural gas, iron ore, 
phosphates, wine, gram, fruit, alfalfa, cork, and 
hides Major imports are textiles, sugar, cereals, 
machinery, iron and steel, coal, and gasoline 
The United States is Algeria's main trading part- 
ner, taking some 43 percent of its exports, in- 
cluding over half its oil Other major partners 
are West Germany, France, and Italy In the mid- 
1970's annual exports totaled about $5 2 billion 
and imports about $5 3 billion 
Transportation The rail and road systems 
mainly serve the northern third of the country 
Roads link the Sahara oil fields to the coast, and 
Algeria is involved in the construction of a 
trans-Saharan highway Air Algeria, the national 
airline, provides extensive domestic and inter- 
national air service 

Communications Communications facilities 
include four daily newspapers and national ra-

The Rise of Nationalisiri. Iwo principal na 
tionalist groups were orgam/t'd m the late 
194(ys ()n<\ thc‘ lyerruxratK Union of the Al- 
gerian Manifesto, was k*d by ferhat Abbas 
(1899- ), who had tornu^rly favored Muslim 

assimilation intt> tht^ french (f>mrnunity The 
othcx group, known as th(^ Movcxnent for the 
Triumph of l>f»mo< ratit liberties (M 1 IT I ), fa- 
vored Arab nationalism In the 1951 elections 
the nationalists scored some gams m the large 
towns In the' following year, howx'ver, many Al- 
gerians abstained from voting m order to pro- 
test Frenc h c olonial polic les, and moeJerates thus 
won most of the* scMts rc'scxved for Muslims 

On Nov* I, 1954, a nationalist uprising in a 
mountainous region of eastern Algeria brought 
French troops into the arc»a to rc'store order. 
Shortly afterward, the* frcmch government or- 
dered the clissolution of thc‘ MJ.l) I which, at 
about the same time, < hangcnl its name to the 
National liberation front (NJ f ) and set up a 
military organization called the National libc^ra- 
tion Army, with h«*adc|uarters in Cairo, Unitexl 
Arab Republic (U.A R., now Arab Rt'publu of 
Egypt) 

The cause of the refuels was favorexJ by vari- 
ous African and Asian nations, fhe principal 
grievances of the Muslims wtm* economic; their 
standard of living blatantly contrasted with that 
of the turc*peans living m Algeria, To appease 
the rc>bels, the French government initiated re- 
forms aimed at giving farmers a larger share of 
the crops and at creating additional joE^s by en- 
couraging investment in Algeria. 

The Franco-Algerlaii War. The* N.LF., how- 
ever, c^cmtinued to engage* in acts of terrorism 
and sabotage?, anci galn€»cl widc»-scale support 
among the native population. So extensive were 
N I F. activities that m early 1957 about 400,000 
French troops were <mgag€*d in the campaign 
against the Algerian nationalists. On fan. 2 the 
French government reported that during 1956 
casualties in Algeria numbered atiout 18^000 
rebel dead and about 11)0 french military and 
civilian dead. In reply to charges of French 
atrocities, a french government report in De- 
cember of that year admitted the use of torture, 
suspicfous '^disappearances'" of those arrested, 
and arbitrary arrests. On fan, 11, 1958, the 
French legislature, spurred by such disclosures, 
adopted a statute designed to bring about a 
gradual increase In Algerian self-rule. 


The Right-Wing Insurrection. The election 
in France in May, 1958, of the moderate political 
leader Pierre Pflimlm (1907- ) as French pre- 
mier precipitated a militanst-colomalist insur- 
rection m Algeria Prompted by the fear that 
Pflimhn would open negotiations with the Alge- 
rian rebels and sever Algeria from France, a 
group of French civilians and army officers in 
Algeria formed the so-called Committee of Pub- 
lic Safety, which declared itself the supreme au- 
thority in Algeria The immediate goal of the 
committc'e was to force the return of General 
Charles de Gaulle (q v ) to power in France, as- 
suming that he would vigorously prosecute the 
war against the nationalists On June 1 de 
Gaulle resumed power, but soon expressed 
himself m favor of eventual self-rule for Algeria 

The N.L.F responded to the return of de 
Gaulle by intensifying its fight for complete in- 
cJependence, even carrying the fight into met- 
ropolitan France In September the N L.F. 
announced the formation of an Algerian gov- 
e*rnment-m-extle with the seat in Cairo, Egypt, 
and Ferhat Abbas as premier Many independ- 
ent Arab governments promptly recognized 
Abbas and his government 

Later that month, to stabilize government 
within his own country, de Gaulle submitted a 
draft constitution of the Fifth French Republic 
to a refe»rendum, which was held in Algeria, 
frame*, and throughout the French Union 
About 80 percent of the electorate went to the 
polls, and, despite threats of reprisal by Algerian 
nationalist leaders, about 97 percent of the vot- 
ers favorc»d the constitution , 

In October, 1958, de Gaulle outlined a five- 
year program of economic and social develop- 
ment for Algeria. The program included provi- 
sions for new jobs, higher wages, more housing, 
redistribution of reclaimed land among Muslim 
farmers, and full political equality of Muslims 
with Europeans in Algeria. On Oct 23, de 
Gaulle invited the leaders of the Algerian gov- 
ernment-in-exile to France for negotiations, but 
the offer was rejected. 

In fate September, 1%0, Abbas traveled to 
Communist China to discuss plans for Chinese 
aid Returning from China, Abbas visited Mos- 
cow four days after the tacit recognition of his 
government by Soviet Premier Nikita S. Khru- 
shchev (q.v.) at the United Nations m New York 
City on Oct. 2, 1960. The threat of increased 
rebel dependence on the Communist bloc 
alarmed Tunisian President Habib Bourguiba 
(q.v.), who announced his aim of seeking a 
union of Algeria and Tunisia in order to prevent 
Communist intervention.

ALGERIA 


On Nov. 2i the official announcement was 
made of a referendum on de Gaulle's polic les, 
which was to take plate early m lanuary, 1%l 
When de Gaulle arrived in Algeria on Oet . H to 
urge a yes" vote on his program, mass demon* 
strations by Europeans erupted m Oran, Algiers 
and smaller cities where he stopped Counter* 
demonstrations by Muslims, a general strike by 
Europeans, and police and army measures left 
over 110 Muslims and 6 Europeans dead. 

Right-wing and rebel leaders called for a boy* 
cott of the referendum, which was held Ian. B, 
1%1, in metropolitan France and )an, 6-B in Ah 
gena. In France, 7S,S percent of those veiling 
supported de Gaulle, and 2S7 percent of the 
electorate abstained. In Algeria, 69.9 percent of 
those voting voted "y^s'', and 42.7 percent of 
those registered did not vote. 

The French government promptly made over- 
tures to the N.l.F, for a conference. Army ele- 
ments in Algeria which were opposed to gov- 
ernmental policy revolted on April 22 and 
seized Algiers, De Gaulle, operating under 
emergency dictatorial powers, suppressed the 
revolt m five days. Many of his opponents es- 
caped, and were instrumental in forming the Se- 
cret Army Organization, called O.A.S. from the 
initials of its French name (Orgdnmtnm de 
rArrrt6e SeerHe), The O.A.S. initiated a cam- 
paign of terror in France and Algeria directed 
against government officials, the N.I.F., and the 
Muslims. The admitted purpose was to incite 
Algerian Muslims to attack the French popula- 
tion and thus force France to retain control m 
Algeria in ord^r to protect its nationals. 
Independence* The N.LF. and French officials 
eventually reached agreement when they met in 
tvian-les-Bains, France, March 7-18, 1962, Their 
agreement provided for a cease-fire and a final 
referendum to permit the Algerian people to 
decide the question of independence. 

Under the proposed terms, Algeria was to 
have complete sovereignty, with an independ- 
ent currency and membership in the French- 
franc monetary area. Its mineral resources were 
to be developed cooperatively with France. The 
agreement also called for a provisional Algerian 
government. Such a body, composed of Mus- 
lims and a European minority, was installed m 
office on April 7. 

When the independence referendum was 
held on July 1, the Algerian electorate voted 
overwhelmingly for independence and cooper- 
ation with France. On July X 1962, de Gaulle 
proclaimed Algeria an Independeni stale, and 
the provisional government-ln-exite arriv^ in 
Algiers from Tunis. 


\UMri while, a struggli* tor power was devel- 
oping within the Algerian leadership Ahmed 
Ben Bella ), although a member of the 

prtwisional govr^rnmenl, set up rival headquar- 
ters m Ifemum and on |ulv 22 announced the 
formation nt a iKiiiiKal bureau headed by him- 
self 1 he pros isionat government c rumbled, and 
on Aug 7 Ben Bella's « hief rivals accepted gov- 
ernment bv his political bureau. Elections were 
held on bepl 20 the new assembly, elected 
from one list ol c andtdaies {most of whom were 
Ben Bella supporiersl, met on Sept. 2S and 
chose Abbas, former premier of the Algerian 
provisional government as president. Ben Bella 
was designated premier tm Sept 26. On Oct. 8, 
Algeria iHname a inemt>i*f cd the United Na- 
tions 

During the early months of independence the 
eiccKlys of french ccifcim deprived Algeria of 
most ol Its civil wrvanis, its merchants, its pri- 
vate capital, ami its taxable imome. Land aban- 
doned by the € 0 km% was ckc upied by peasants, 
and tn 1961 Ben Bella strengthened the land-re- 
form program already lM»gun by the expropria- 
tion ol owm*f“iHcyp»«»d land. He also national- 
ized sf^veral business enierpriM^s. Dissension 
wiihm the government was c limaxed (Aug. 14) 
by the resigr^aticm of President Abbas On Sept. 
8 a draft consinution providing for a single- 
pariy presidential system of government was ap- 
proved by the elwtorate former premier Ben 
Bella was elected presicJent and look office on 
Sept 20 His personal power was consolidated 
by fading or exiling most of his opponents. 

Meanwhdff, foreign investment m Algeria had 
became virfually nonexistent. Economic aid 
from Western nations was received mainly from 
f ranee, but produilion slumped and the coun- 
try was beset with IckkI shortages, rising prices, 
and unemployment In foreign policy, Ben Bella 
supporled Afncan nationalist movements and 
pursued a couim* intended to retain Western 
economic suppon while establishing close ties 
with the Communist bloc In 1964-65 Algeria re- 
ceived Soviet aid totaling mote than S20DXIOO,- 
WO in purchase crediis and a loan ol $50/)00^ 
from China. I^n Bella was deposed on |yrv® 19, 
1%5, by a military coup lt*d by Colonel Houari 
Boumedienne {1927*78), chief of the armed 
forces, who charged that the diciatoriti and 
reckless use of power by Ben Bella had left Alp- 
ria in "angui#i''. The dteposed government was 
r^pteced by a iwolutionary council of twenty- 
six memberf, headed by Boumedienne, who

a leading supporter of national liberation move- 
ments, such as the Polisano of Western Sahara, a 
Spanish territory ceded to Morocco and Mauri- 
tania in 1976 Relations with these countries 
subsequently deteriorated 

In 1976 Algeria adopted a new constitution, 
under which the country was declared a one- 
party, socialist state and Boumedienne, unop- 
posed, was elected president Two years into his 
new term, Boumedienne died and was suc-

ALGIERS (Fr. Alger), capital and largest city in 
Algeria, on the w. shore of the Bay of Algiers, 
about 200 miles n,e. of Oran. Algiers is the prin-

IS divided into two sections. The lower part is 
the modern city, built by the French, with wide 
boulevards, theaters, cathedrals, museums, an 
opera house, and many educational institutions, 
including the University of Algiers and several 
Muslim schools. The upper part is the old city, 
with narrow, twisting streets dominated by the 
Casbah, a 16th-century fortress built by the 
Turks, which lends Its name to the entire quar- 
ter. With the post-World War II increase In pop- 
ulation, and the inadequacy of the cramped na- 
tive quarter, suburbs have burgeoned. Algiers 
has a leading international air terminal and is 
the hub of a network of railways and roads. Its 
strategic position and fine harbor make it a 
flourishing commercial-shipping center and a 
major Mediterranean refueling station. 

By 1200 8C the Phoenicians had colonized 
the site and set up a coastal trading post. Fol- 
lowing the Punic Wars ten centuries later, Al- 
giers, then called Icosium, became part of the 
Roman Empire in 146 sc and remained Roman 
until the middle of the 5th century, when it was 
overrun by the Vandals, Within a century it was 
captured by Byzantine forces, who, in turn, 
were ousted in 650 by Arabs. The present city 
was founded about by Berbers. During the 
next five centuries control of the city was 
gained and lost by various European, Arabian, 
and Berber warlords. In 1510 the Spanish cap- 
tured and fortified the islet in front of the har- 
bor, known as the Pehdn. In 1518 Algiers pro- 
claimed itself part of the Ottoman Empire, and 
the Algerians, with the aid of the Turks, drove 
out the Spanish, While ruled by Turkey the city 
became the capital of the infamous Barbary 
Coast (q.v,). For 300 years Barbary pirates preyed 


upon European, and later United States, ship- 
ping In 1815 the American naval captain Ste- 
phen Decatur (q v ) led an expedition against 
Algiers and forced the Algerian governor to sign 
a peace treaty promising to end pirate attacks 
on U.S ships The piracy continued, however, 
and in 1816 the combined Dutch and British 
navies almost completely destroyed the entire 
Algerian fleet Its powers greatly diminished, Al- 
giers, nonetheless, remained a pirate port until 
1830, when France, ostensibly retaliating against 
attacks on French vessels, captured the city and, 
in the ensuing eighteen years, the entire coun- 
try. The French retained control until 1962, 
when Algeria gained independence During 
World War il Algiers served as Allied headquar- 
ters from 1942 to 1944 in North Africa and was 
the headquarters of the Free French government 
of General Charles de Gaulle (qv) Pop, (1970

ALCOA BAY, large inlet of the Indian Ocean, 
at the SE extremity of Africa, in Cape of Good 
Hope Province, Republic of South Africa, about 
400 miles e. of the Cape of Good Hope The bay 
is of considerable commercial importance On 
the western side is Port Elizabeth, one of the 
principal seaports of the Republic of South Af- 
rica. Algoa Bay was the landing place of the first

ALGOL, variable star of the northern heavens, 
also called Persei, the second-brightest star m 
the constellation Perseus (q.v.). It is about 115 
light years from the earth, and its light varies 
over a period of 68 hr., 48 mm , and 56 sec. For 
about 59 hr, the light Is almost constant, during 
the next 5 hr. it decreases to 30 percent of its 
original strength; it then increases again in 5 
more hours. The variation was probably known 
to the Arabs although the explanation was fi- 
nally confirmed by the German astrophysicist 
Hermann Carl Vogel (1841 -1 907) in 1889 Algol 
is composed of two stars of unusual brightness 
about 6,000,000 mi. apart, far too close to be dis- 
tinguishable with the most powerful telescopes 
on earth. These two stars revolve around each 
other, and periodically the brighter is partially 
eclipsed by the darker. The eclipse is not total 
because the plane of revolution of the stars is 
inclined to the line of sight by a little more than 
8®. The stars are each about 1,500,000 mi in di- 
ameter, The darker star ts about 15 percent 
larger in diameter than its companion, but only 
about Vao as bright. About 300 other variable stars 
of this type are now known. These are called 
Algol-type variables, or eclipsing binaries; see 
DouBie Stars. Their periods vary from 6 hr, to 29 
years.

fourth caliph of Islam and son-m-law of the 
Prophet Muhammad (q.v.); see Caliph He was 
born in Mecc a (q.v.), the son of Abu Talib, Mu- 
hammad's uncle All was one of the first con- 
verts to Islam (q.v.) and one of the bravest and 
most faithful followers of the Prophet. He mar- 
ried Muhammad's daughter Fatima (q.v.), who 
bore him two sons, Hasan and Husein. In 632, 
when Muhammad died. Ah claimed that he, Ali, 
should succeed him as the leader of Islam. He 
was preceded in the caliphate, however, by Abu 
Bakr (q.v.), Omar I (5B1?“644), and Othman 
(575?%%), and did not become caliph until 656, 
when Othman was murdered. In the first year of 
his reign he was forced to deal with a rebellion 
led by Aisha (q.v.), whom Muhammad had 
married after the death of Fatima's mother and 
who bitterly opposed All's claim of succession 
Though the rebellion was suppressed m 657, 
disputes over AM's right to the caliphate were 
not resolved Muawiyah I (see Cauph. The 
Immediate Successors), a member of Othman's 
family, refused to recognize Alt as caliph and 
claimed the caliphate himself. This dispute con- 
tinued until 661, when AM was murdered at Kufa

ctiius CiAY. Ik (1942- ), American boxer, born 

in Louisville, Ky. After winning the light-heavy- 
weight title at the 1'>60 Olympic Games, he be- 
came a professional fighter. At first he attracted 
as much attention by his extravagant self-praise, 
usually offered in rhymed couplets, as by his 
boxing ability. But in .1%4, after only twenty 
professional fights, he upset the American 
fighter Charles (Sonny) Liston (19J4-70) and be- 
came world heavyweight champion, later in 
1964, after joining the Black Muslims (q.v.), he 
assumed the name Muhammad Ali In 1967 he 
refused induction Into the United States Army 
on the grounds that he was a Biack Muslim min- 
ister and a conscientious objector. He was sub- 
sequently convicted of draft evasion, and the 
ruling bodies of boxing declared bis title vacant. 
He returned to the ring In W7Q and won two 
fights, but lost a championship boat to the 
American Joe Frazier (1943- ) in March, 1971. 
Later that year, the Supreme Court of the United 
States overturned All's conviction. After win- 
ning several bouts, he lost to the American Ken 
Norton (1945- ) In March, 1973. Ali made a 
comeback In 1974 by defeating Frazier in lanu- 
ary, then regained the title by knocking out tfw 
champion, the American prizefighter George 
Foreman (1949- ), on Oct, 30, 1974, In Kin-

mula that opens the door to the cave of rtrtibers 
In the absence of the thieves, he repeats the for-

loads his donkey with treasure. His brother, 
Kasim, tries to imitate Ali Baba's success. After 
entering the cave, however, Kasim forgets the 
word "sesame" and is slain by the robbers In an

ALIEN, foreign-born resident m a country of 
which he is not a naturalfirf*d citizem. If an alien 
does not become a citizen by naturalization, he 
does not possess such political rights as voting 
and holding public office*. In the United States 
aliens are subiect to military and police duty 
and may be requireci to contribute to the sup- 
port of public services; they may acquire, con- 
vey, and transmit title to real and personal prop- 
erty. In accordance with the Allen Registration 
Act of 1940, aliens over fourteen years of age 
must 'be* r€*gistered and fingerprinted. See Immi-

AUEN AND SEDITION ACTS, In American 
political history, four laws passed in 1796. The 
Naturalization Act, raising from five to fourteen 
the number of years of residence required for 
naturalization, was repealed in 1802. The Allen 
Act, empowering the President to arrest and de- 
port any alien considered dangerous, expired in 
1B00, The Allen Inemy Act, which expired in 
180D, provided for the arrest and deportation of 
subjects of foreign powers at war with the 
United States, The Sedition Ac4, which expired 
In 1801, made It a criminal offense to print or 
publish false, malicious, or scandalous state- 


ments directed against the government of the 
United States, the President, or Congress, to fos- 
ter opposition against the lawful acts of Con- 
gress or of the President, or to aid a foreign 
power in plotting against the U S 
The Alien and Sedition Acts were enacted by 
a Federalist Congress and signed by President 
John Adams (q v.) The first three were aimed 
largely at Irish immigrants and French refugees, 
who had been active in the republican societies 
hostile to the Adams administration For the 
most part the three laws were a response to the 
intense antiforeign sentiment engendered by 
the XYZ Affair (q v.), which had involved French 
and American diplomats 
The Sedition Act, which elicited the most op- 
position, was a federalist attempt to stifle politi- 
cal opposition and to check the activities of 
those Americans who sympathized with the rev- 
olutionary government in France Before it ex- 
pired, about twenty-five people, all members of 
the Republican Party, were arrested under the 
terms of the Sedition Act, and about ten were 
convicted The extreme severity of the statutes, 
and the partisan spirit that had produced them, 
caused an immediate and vehement popular 
reaction throughout the country. This hostility 
was reflected in such documents as the Ken- 
tucky and Virginia Resolutions (q.v.), drafted re- 
spectively by Vice-President Thomas jefferson 
and lames Madison (qq.v.). These resolutions 
were also important as the first statement in 
American political history of the principle of 
nullification (q v.), which later became a basic 
tenet of the doctrine of States' rights (q.v ). The 
popular opposition to the Alien and Sedition 
Acts was a major factor in the downfall of the 
Federalist Party (q.v.). After the expiration of the 
Sedition Act, it was generally conceded that in 
attempting to restrict publications Congress had 
violated the prohibition contained in the First 
Amendment to the United States Constitution 
against making laws abridging the freedom of 
the press.

GESTION 

ALIMONY, in law in Great Britain and the 
United States, an allowance that a woman is en 
titled to receive from the income or the estate 
of her husband or former husband during and 
after an action for separation or divorce (qq v.). 
Alimony granted during the course of such an 
action is known as alimony pendente fite, and is 
designed to enable a wife to carry on litigalion 
against her husband by securing her support 
while the suit is pending. Such alimony is fixed 
at the discretion of the court; usually no allow 
ance will be made if the wife has sufficient 
means of her own. Alimony dec reed to a wife as 
the result of litigation in her favor is known as 
permanent alimony; if the result of litigation is 
against the wife, no alimony allowance is made 
As m the case of alimony pendente iite, the 
amount of permanent alimony is fixed by the 
court. Usually paid in the form of a pcmodit al* 
towance, it varies with the means of the bus 
band and the needs anci position of the wife A 
decree providing for alimony may be enforced 
by contempt (q.v.) proceedings and the com* 
mitment of a defaulting husband to latl; more* 
over, in most of the States of the U.S„ the court 
can prevent a husband from leaving the Slate it 
it appears that he means thereby to avoid pay* 
ment. The term alimony may also designate the 
payments that must be made by a woman to a 
former husband, although such cases are rela- 
tively rare.

AL-KHWARIZMI (780-asO?), Arab mathema- 
tician, born in Khwanzm (now Khiva, Uzbek S. 
S.R.). He was librarian at the court of Caliph al- 
Mamun (786-633) and astronomer at the 
Baghdad observatory. His works on algebra, 
arithmetic, and astronomical tables greatly ad- 
vanced mathematical thought, and he was the 
first to use for mathematical purposes the ex- 
pression al jabr, from which the English word al- 
gebra IS derived. The Latin version, by the Italian 
translator Gerard of Cremona (1114?-1187), of 
his treatise on algebra (based on a Hindu work) 
was responsible for much of the mathematical 
knowledge of medieval Europe. His work on al- 
gorism, a term derived from his name, intro- 
duced the method of calculating by use of Ara- 
bic numerals and decimal notation, 

ALKMAAR^ town of the Netherlands, in North 
Holland Province, on the North Holland Canal, 
about 20 miles n.w of Amsterdam. It is a trading 
center for cattle, com, and dairy products; 
cheese is a major export, and sailcloth is manu- 
factured there. In 1573 the town successfully 
withstood a Spanish siege. In October, 1799, 
during the Napoleonic Wars (q.v.), the com- 
mander in chief of the Anglo-Russian army in 
the Netherlands signed the French terms of 
capitulation in Alkmaar. Pop. (1972) 50,726. 

AL KUWAIT or KUWAIT, capital of the 
sheikdom of Kuwait (q.v.) and port on Al Ku- 
wait Bay, on the n.w. coast of the Persian Gulf, 
80 miles se. of Basra, Iraq. Rich oil fields in the 
coastal desert and in the gulf have provided rev- 
enue for making the city one of the most mod- 
ern in the Middle East. An important oil port, Al 
Kuwait produces petrochemicals and other pe- 
troleum products and is a center for the produc- 
tion of hides and skins, carpets, handicrafts, 
boats, wood and metal products, bricks, ce- 
ment, chemicals, flour, wool, and frozen fish. 
Shrimp and pearls are obtained from the Persian 
Gulf. The city is the site of Kuwait University; 
vocational-training, technical, and teachers' col- 
leges; and a state museum. Founded in the early 


18th century, Al Kuwait was once considered as 
terminus for a projected Berlin-Baghdad Rail- 
way The name is also spelled Al-Kuwayt, Ku-

ALKYD, term for the macromolecular ester 
formed by the reaction of a polyhydnc alcohol, 
the molecules of which contain two or more

groups The alkyds, or aikyd resins (q v ) are very 
widely used in the protective-coatings industry

ALLAH, Muslim name for the Supreme Being 
The term is a contraction of the Arabic ai-llah, 
"the Cod" Both the idea and the word existed 
in pre-lslamic Arabian tradition, in which some 
evidence of a primitive monotheism can also be 
found Although they recognized other, lesser 
gods, the Arab heathens recognized Allah as the 
supreme God and turned to Him in times of 
trouble 

The Koran (q v ), the holy book of Islam (q v ), 
asserts that Allah is the Creator and the One 
who rewards and punishes, that He is unique 
and can only be one; that He is eternal, omnis- 
cient, omnipotent, and all-merciful The core of 
the religion is submission to the will of Allah, 
man must abandon himself entirely to God's 
sovereignty. 

Although as Creator Allah is utterly transcend- 
ent and not to be compared to any of his crea- 
tures, He IS nevertheless a personal god, a fair 
judge, merciful and benevolent Each chapter of 
the Koran begins with "Allah, the Merciful, the 
Compassionate", and before fulfilling religious 
obligations the Muslim recites "in the name of 
Allah, the Merciful, the Compassionate" 

Islam does not admit of any mediator be- 
tween Cod and man, man approaches Allah di- 
rectly in personal prayer and in reciting the 
Koran, considered to be literally the speech of 
Allah. The prophets, who conveyed the word of 
Allah, are not considered m any way divine. 
ALLAHABAD, city of the Republic of India, in 
Uttar Pradesh State, and capital of the Allahabad 
District, at the confluence of the Jumna and 
Ganges rivers, about 350 miles s e of New Delhi. 
An important railroad junction, Allahabad is a 
trading center for agricultural products, notably 
rice, pulse, wheat, tobacco, cotton, and sugar- 
cane. Known originally as Prag, it is one of the 
oldest and holiest cities m India, visited annu- 
ally by hundreds of thousands of Hindu pil- 
grims. The Mogul emperor Akbar (q.v.) gave the 
city the present name in 1575. Points of interest 
include a stone pillar dating from the reign of 
the Indian king Asoka (q.v.), a fort and the rums

Although the river flows through a hilly region, 
it is navigable for small boats for nearly 200 mi.

ALLEGHENY MOUNTAINS, or I HE At II

w of the Blue Ridge (q.v.) in Pennsylvania, 
Maryland, Virginia, and West Virginia. Varying 
from 2000 ft. to more than 4S0Q ft. in height, the 
range is composed of stratified rcK'ks of the Silu 
nan, Devonian, and Carboniferous ages, and is 
rich in timber and minerals (see Shurian Ac.t;

ALLEGORY, fictional literary narrative or artis- 
tic expression that conveys a symbolic meaning 
parallel to but distinct from, and more impar» 
tant than, the literal meaning. The Greek philos 
opher Aristotle and the Rorrtan rhetorician 
Quintilian (qq.v.) defined allegory as an ex^ 
tended metaphor. The symbolic meaning is usu- 
ally expressed through personifications and 
other symbols. In literature both the fable and 
the parable (qq.v.) are didactic, comparatively 
short and simple allegories. Allegory is used in 
the Bible, notably, in the parables of the New 
Testament; and some theologians have inter- 
preted the Old Tesiamertt allegorically. Al- 
though little fully developed allegory is found *n 
ancient Greek or Latin literature, the 4th century 
B.C. Greek philosopher Plato (q-v.) used it in The 
Republic The poem Fsychomachm by the 4th 
century a,d. Latin poet At^rellus Clemens Pry- 
dentius (q.v.) is usually considered the first 
Christian allegory.

were rnemlH*rs of Ihe Green Mountain Boys 
(qv.) and fought m the American Revolution 
(q V ) against the Briiish 
Ethan Allen (17111-89), American Revolution- 
ary patriot, born m iiiihiield, Cor>n, In 1769 he 
moved to the region known as the New Hamp- 
shire Grants, composing presemhday Vermont. 
After settimg irt Bimnmgton, he became promi- 
nently involved m Ihe struggle between New 
York and New Hampshire lor control of the re- 
gion. following reiection by the New York au- 
thorities of an apical that the region be estab- 
lished as a separate province, Allen organized a 
volunteer milma, called the Green Mountain 
Boys, to resist and evit i proponents of the New 
York cause, He was thereupon declared an out- 
law by the royal governor of New York. At the 
outbreak of Ihe American Revolution, Allen and 
his force offered thetr services agamst the Brit- 
ish. Acting on orders from the Connecticut leg- 
islature, he, the Connecticut soldier Benedict 
Arnold (q.v.), and a contingent of the Green 
Mountain Boys surprised and captured Fort Ti- 
conderoga early In the morning of May ID, 1775.

Allen demanded surrender from the British 
commander "In the name of the Great Jehovah 
and the Continental Congress''. Subsequently, 
as a member of the army of General John Philip 
Scuyler (q.v.), he rendered valuable service in 
the American military expedition sent against 
Canada. He was taken prisoner near Montreal in 
September, 1775, and held in confinement until 
exchanged In 177B. Following his release by the 
British he returned to his home and was com- 
missioned a lieutenant colonel in the Continen- 
tal Army and major general of militia. 

in 1778 Allen appeared before the Continen- 
tal Congress in behalf of a claim by Vermont for 
recognition as an independent State. With his 
brother Ira and other Vermonters he devoted 
most of his time thereafter to the territorial dis- 
pute He negotiated with the governor of Can- 
ada between 1780 and 1783, ostensibly for the 
purpose of establishing Vermont as a British 
province. On the basis of this activity Allen was 
charged with treason, but, because the negotia- 
tions were demonstrably intended to force 
favorable action on the Vermont case by the 
Continental Congress, the charge was never 
substantiated. He wrote a Narrative of Colonel 
Ethan Allen's Captivity (1779). 


Ira Allen (1751-1814), soldier in the American 
Revolution, born in Cornwall, Conn. In 1772 he 
moved to Vermont and joined the Green Moun- 
tain Boys in support of his brother Ethan. He 
was active (1780-91) in obtaining statehood for 
Vermont and largely responsible for the found- 
ing (1789) of the University of Vermont He was 
also the author of The Natural and Political His- 
tory of Vermont (1798)

pieces soon after leaving tollege In 1931 his 
first book, Only Yei^terday, m informal sotial 
history of the United States in the l92(Vs, met 
with wide success; Since Yesterday {1940) was a 
similar treatment of the 1930's, Both are credited 
with having caught the unique flavor of these 
decades tersely and entertainingly. His other 
works include The Lords of Creadon (1935) ar^d 
The Great Pterpont Morgan (1949). 

ALLEN, Richard (1760-18)1), Negro American 
clergyman, born in Philadelphia, Pa. A son ot a 
slave, Allen was freed after his master had been 
converted to Methodism. Allen was ordained a 
minister in 1784 at the first conference ot the 
Methodist Church in America. During the next 
two years he was an itinerant preacher. While 
preaching at St. George's Church m Philadeh 
phia in 1786, an incident of racial prefudice oc 
curred, which is believed to have caused him to 
begin working for the establishment of an inde- 
pendent Methodist church for Negro membc^rs. 
This separate church was formed in 1799. In 
1816 the African Methodist episcopal Church 
(q.v.) was formed, uniting the Negro congrega-

settlers were of German extraction. During the 
Revolutionary War the town was an important 
munitions-supply point for the Continental 
Army. It was incorporated as Northampton Bor- 
ough in 1B11, but in 1838 the original name was

ALLERGY^ a condition of hypersensitivity in 
certain persons or animals to substances harm- 
less to most individuals. Some people have 
characterized allergy as immunity (q.v.) '‘'gone 
w^ong'^ In the immune reaction contact with a 
disease-producing micro-organism or a toxin 
prompts an. individual to build up antibodies 
(proteins related to globulin serum) against the 
offending organism or toxin so that he will be 
protected against further exposure. All normal 


people are able to produce such protective anti- 
bodies In a few people, however, the capacity 
to differentiate potentially harmful substances 
from harmless ones is lost These persons pro- 
duce antibodies against one or many inof- 
fensive substances, and thus are said to be aller- 
gic. When an antibody reacts with an antigen (a 
substance that stimulates the formation of anti- 
bodies) in such a person, he has an allergic reac- 
tion. The symptoms of that reaction will depend 
on where it takes place If it occurs m the nose it 
may cause sneezing and running of the nose, 
giving rise to hay fever (q v ) In the air passages 
it may cause contraction, leading to wheezing, 
coughing and difficulty in breathing, as in 
asthma In the skin, it may produce itching 
spots, hives or welts (urticaria). If the reaction 
takes place m the circulating blood, a severe 
reaction known as serum sickness may ensue 
The allergen^ or the substance producing the 
reaction, is usually a protein or protein-carbohy- 
drate complex. It may be inhaled, as dust or pol- 
len; It may be eaten, as eggs or shellfish; it may 
be injected, as penicillin; or it may act by mere 
contact, as wool, adhesive tape, or metal 

The variety of substances to which a person 
may be allergic is almost infinite; diagnosis in- 
volves discovering the particular substance or 
substances to which the patient is hypersensi- 
tive (reacting excessively) A careful history of 
the development of the allergic reaction may 
give a clue, particularly when it is seasonal, or 
associated with an exposure to a specific sub- 
stance, or when it occurs only in a particular 
place. Often the patient can remain unaffected 
merely by avoiding the particular allergen to 
which he reacts allergically but common aller- 
gens such as dust or pollen cannot easily be 
avoided. 

An allergic individual may develop new hy- 
persensitivities, or old hypersensitivities may die 
out. Allergies usually first appear in childhood, 
adolescence, or early adulthood, but may de- 
velop for the first time later in life Sometimes 
psychic factors, stemming from emotional con- 
flicts, play an important role m allergy. An aller- 
gic individual may be symptom-free despite ex- 
posure to the allergen during periods of 
emotional tranquillity. Conversely, emotional 
upsets may bring on the allergic attack. See Psy- 
chosomatic Medicine. 

The mechanism of allergic reactions is not 
fully understood. Most likely the antigen is asso- 
ciated with a particular tissue, such as the cells 
lining the nasal passages or the bronchial tubes 
The antibody reacts with the antigen at these 
sites, causing the release of certain chemical

substances, including histamme (q.v whuh 
mediates or brings about the reat tion. The diag 
nosis of an allergic problem in a patient is made 
from his history, which often gives a ( tue as to 
the underlying allergen. Sometimes allergy test- 
ing employing skin tests with a wide variety of 
common allergens may be needc*d to pm point 
the specific allergen or allergens causing dif- 
ficulties. 

The treatment of an allergy depends on how 
troublesome it is. The simplest and best treat- 
ment, when possible, is to avoid contact with 
the allergen. A person allergic to horse' dander, 
feathers, particular pollens, or particular foocis 
or medicines, for example, may avoid them. 
Where this is not feasible either because the al- 
lergen IS unknown, or bec*ause it affects more 
than one part of the body or whem there are too 
many alk'rgens, the use of drugs to dec rease the 
reaction, such as antihistamines or, m more seri- 
ous cases, adrenal cortical steroids may be ad 
ministered. In other cases desensiti/ation (the 
process of making the patiertl able to tolerate 
the antigen without having a reaction) may be 
accomplished by giving inierttons of antigen, 
first In very minute doses, and then in gradually 
increasing doses as tolerance builds up. Skin 
testing IS always needed when desensm/aiion 
treatment is being considered. Symptomatic 
treatment, such as the administration of drugs 
to relax spasm in the walls of the bronchi m 
asthmatics, decongestants for hay fever suffer 
ers, or local ointments to relieve itching for 
hives may also be useful. Sec* Asihma. 8«<rNC hi^i;

ALlliONE, Samuel Austin 1 1816-89), Ameri- 
tan bibliographer and librarian, born in Phila- 
delphia, Pa AllilMme was editor of publications 
and < orrespcmding mrelary of the American 
Sunday School Union from 1867 to 1873 and 
from 1877 to 1879 from 1879 to 1888 he was 
head librarian of the ienox library (now part of 
the New York Public I ibrary) in New York City. 
He IS best remembered as the compiler of A 
Critical Dtcitomry of inglhh Itiemture and of

has about twenty teeth. The eggs are laid on 
shore in a nest of leaves and mud and are 
hatched by the sun's heat. As many as sixty may 
be laid m one nest. Alligators feed on fish, frogs, 
snakes, turtles, birds, mammals, and carrion 
In the wild state they are dangerous to man 
chiefly when disturbed or wounded. In the vi- 
cinity of settled areas they shun, rather than at- 
tack, human beings. Alligator hides are made 
into highly prized leather used for belts, hand- 
bags, and shoes. Because of the demand for 
hides, efforts have been made to protect alliga- 
tors from poachers. See Crocodilf. J.A.O. 
ALLIGATOR LIZARD, common name for 
lizards of the genus Cerrhonotus in the Angu- 
idae family. Four species occur in the United 
States. The northern alligator lizard, C. coeru- 
leus has the widest range, from southern British 
Columbia down to central coastal California 
and the Sierra Nevada, and east into the Rocky 
Mts. in Montana All species are secretive, with 
short legs, long tails, and a conspicuous lateral 
fold on the slender body. They usually frequent 
moist hilly country.

popular phrase "through thick and thin" is a 
simple example of alliteration. The technique is 
widely used as a literary device in the composi-

ALLOBROGES, Celtic race of ancient Gaul, 
whose territory lay between the Rhdne and 
Is^re rivers and Lake Geneva, in the vicinity of 
the present-day French-Swiss border Their 
chief town was Vienna (now Vienne, France) on 
the Rhdne R., and their frontier town against the 
Helvetii (q.v.) was Geneva, Switzerland After 
they were defeated by the Romans in 121 bc, 
their territory was incorporated into Transalpine 
Caul In 63 bc envoys of the Allobroges were 
invited to take part in the conspiracy led by the 
Roman statesman Lucius Sergius Catilina (q.v,), 
but, preferring to perform a service for the 
Roman government, they informed the Roman 
statesman and orator Marcus Tullius Cicero

(q.v ) to lower a feverish body temperature. For 
many centuries the accepted system of mede 
erne, allopathy did not actually receive its name 
until late in the 18lh century, when the German 
physician Samuel Hahnemann (q.v.) first used 
the term to contrast with his own system of 
medicine, called homeopathy (q.v.). Allopathy 
is still used as a medical approach but usually m 
combination with other methods of treatment. 
ALLORI^ name of two Italian painters of the 
later Florentine school. 

Alessandro Allori (1 5^5-1607), born in Flor- 
ence, and trametJ under the Florentine painter II 
Bronzino (q.v.). Alessandro's style is character- 
ized by a subtle imitation of the work of the 
Italian artist Michelangelo (q.v.). Alessandro 
worked chiefly in the churches of floreme and 
Tuscany and in the Villa Poggia a Cajano m Flor- 
ence, He also painted portraits and wrote a trea- 
tise on anatomy for artists. 

Cristofano Allori (1577-^1621), born m flor 
ence, son and pupil of Alessandro Alien. Cristo* 
fane became a better known and more impor- 
tant artist than his father. His style is mannered, 
reflecting the influence of the Italian painter 
Andrea del Sarto (q.v.). Cristolano's most cele- 
brated work, '^Judith with the Head of Hob 
femes'', and his "St. )ulian" are in the Pitii Pal- 
ace collection in Florence, His "Isabella of Ara 
gon Pleading with Charles VIH" is at the louvre 
in Paris, 

ALLOTROPES, two or more forms of the same 
element that differ m physical properties, Color, 
luster, density, hardness, odor, and eleclrical 
and thermal conductivity may differ greatly 
among allotropic forms. Diamond and graphite 
are allotropic forms of carbon (qq.v.); phospho- 
rus (q.v.) has four allotropic forms; and the ele^ 
ment sulfur (q.v,) has six allotropic forms which 
are produced by different methods of healing 
and cooling. 

ALIOWAY, Great Britain, village of Ayr Co,* 
Scotland, about 2 miles s of Ayre. It is the birth- 
place of the celebrated author and poet Robert 
Burns (q.v.), whose house was converted into a 
museum in 1880. The Burns Monument, erected 
in 1820, is in the village, and the "haunted kirk" 
and other places to which the poet referred in 
his writings are still to be seen in Alloway. 
AiLOY^ intimate mixture of two or more met- 
als (q.v.). Alloys, like pure metals, possess metal- 
lic luster and conduct heat and electricity well, 
though not in general so well as the pure metals 
of which they are formed. On the other hand, 
the compounds of metals with nonmelalllc ele- 
ments such as sulfur or chlorine do not possess 
metallic properties. Mixtures of metals with ele- 


mrmts intermediate^ between metals and non- 
metals. partHulariy with larhon, are similar to 
alk>ys anti are frequently t ailed alloys. The most 
important of these st> t ailed alloys is steel. Sim- 
ple tarbon steels ttmsisl of about .5 percent 
manganese and up to B iM^nent tarbon, with 
the remaining material iron 

An alios may consist of an mtermetatlic com- 
poumi, a solid solution, an intimate mixture of 
minute rrystafs of the tonslilucmt metallic ele- 
ments, or any comhmatHm of solutions or mix- 
tures of the foregoing Intermetallic com- 
pounds, sue h as NaAu^, CTiSn, and CuAI^, do not 
follow the ordmary rules of valency. They are 
generally hard and brittle and, although they 
have not been impcjriant m the past where 
stfertgth IS required, nr^ny new developments 
have appeared which make such compounds of 
im reasmg im|K>rtanc e, Alloys c onsisttng of solu- 
tions or mixtures of two metals generally have 
lower meltmg points than the pure constituents. 
The mixture with a lower meltmg point than any 
other mixtufe of the same constituents ts called 
a euler tit mixture. The eulectoid, which is the 
solid-phase analogue of the eutectic, frequently 
has belter strength and other physical character- 
istics than alloys of ddlerent proportions, and Is 
frequently used luteuii alloys of three or four 
metals, with lower meltmg points than alloys of 
slightly different pmpiwtmm, are also fre- 
quently used 

I he properties of allc^ys are frequently far dif- 
ferent from those of the c onshtuent elements, 
and suih properties as strength and corrosion 
resistance may be considerably greater for an 
alloy than lor any of the separate metals. For this 
reason, alloys are more generally used than pure 
metals Thus* steel it stronger and harder than 
wrought iron, whic h is approximately pure iron, 
and IS ysi*d m far greater quantities, The alloy 
steels, mixtures of steel with such metals as 
chromtym. manganesi\ molybdenum, nickel, 
tungsten, and vanadium, are stronger and 
harder than steel itself, and many of them are 
mlm more corrosion^resistanl than iron or steel. 
An alloy can often be made to match a prede- 
termined set of chafarterisiics The most obvi- 
ous CMW m which panic olar characteristics are 
necessary is in the ^wgn of rockets, spacecraft, 
and supersonic aircraft The materials used in 
iheiMS vehicles and their engines must be light In 
weight, very strong, and able to sustain very 
high temperatures wiihoui losing their stmngth. 
Aerodynamic friction causes these vehicles to 
heal up exceifively. To withstand these high 
temperatures and wduce the overall weight, 
lightweight, high-itrength alloys of alyminum,

ALLUVIUM 


beryllium, and titanium have been developed 
To resist the heat generated during reentry into 
the atmosphere of the earth, alloys containing 
heat-resistant metals such as tantalum, colum- 
bium, tungsten, cobalt, and nickel are being 
used in space vehicles 

A wide variety of special alloys containing 
metals such as beryllium, boron, columbium, 
hafnium, and zirconium, which have particular 
nuclear absorption characteristics, are being 
used in nuclear reactors (see Nuclear Power) 
Niobium-tin alloys are used as electrical con- 
ductors at extremely low (cryogenic) tempera- 
tures Special copper, nickel, and titanium al- 
loys, designed to resist the corrosive effects of 
boiling salt water for twenty to thirty years, are 
being used in desalmization plants 

Most alloys are prepared by mixing the mol- 
ten metals. A recently developed process, called 
powder metallurgy, is becoming increasingly 
important in the preparation of alloys that have 
special characteristics. In this process the alloys 
are prepared by mixing dry powders of the met- 
als, squeezing them together under high pres- 
sure, and then heating them to temperatures 
just below their melting points. The result is a 
solid, homogeneous alloy. Tough tungsten al- 
loys containing nickel, iron, or copper are pre- 
pared in this way for use as cutting tools. Mass- 
produced products may be prepared by this 
technique at great savings in cost. For example, 
gears used in washing machines are made to 
exact measurement, without machining, by mix- 
ing a small quantity of copper powder into a 
quantity of iron powder and then subjecting the 
mixture to high pressure. The resulting gear is 
ready for immediate use. Other new alloys 
made possible by powder metallurgy are cer- 
mets, which are alloys of metal and carbides, 
borides, oxides, silicides, or nitrides. Cermets 
combine the advantages of the high-tempera- 
ture strength, stability, and oxidation resistance 
of the ceramic compound with the ductility and 
shock resistance of the metal, 

Sterling silver, 14-karat gold, white gold, and 
platinum-irrdlum are precious-metal alloys. Bab- 
bitt metal, brass, Britannia metal, bronze, Dow- 
metal, German silver, gun metal, monel metal, 
pewter, and solder are familiar alloys of less pre- 
cious metals. Commercially pure aluminum is, 
because of its impurities, actually an alloy (see 
Aluminum). The alloys of mercury with other 
metals are called amalgams. 

ALL SAINTS' DAY, or ALLHAILOWS, or HAL- 
LOWMAS, festival celebrated on Nov. 1 in the 
Roman Catholic and Anglican churches in 
honor of Cod and all His saints, known and un- 


known It became established as a church festi- 
val early in the 7th century when the Pantheon 
(q V ) in Rome was consecrated as the Church of 
the Blessed Virgin and All Martyrs. Pope Greg- 
ory IV (d 844) gave the custom official authori- 
zation in 835 Nov 1 may have been chosen be-

ALLSTON, Washington (1779-1843), Ameri- 
can painter and author, born on a plantation on 
the Waccamaw River, S.C., and educated at Har- 
vard University, at the Royal Academy in Lon- 
don, in Pans, and in Florence and Rome In 1818 
he settled permanently in the United States, liv- 
ing for the remainder of his life in and near Bos- 
ton, Mass. His paintings are numerous and tech- 
nically proficient, portraying dramatic subjects, 
usually scriptural or classical, A large painting 
entitled ''Belshazzar's Feast" (Boston Athe- 
naeum) occupied the last twenty-five years of 
his life, but was left unfinished. His writings in- 
clude a collection of poems, The Sylphs of the 
Seasons (1813); a romance, Monaldt (1842), and 
Lectures on Art (posthumously published, 1850) 
ALLUVIUM, clay, gravel, sand, silt, or similar 
loose material deposited by flowing water Allu- 
vium usually occurs at any point where the ve- 
locity of fast-running water is abruptly slowed 
and the carrying capacity of the flow reduced to 
a point where transport of the sediment is no 
longer possible. Alluvial deposits are found on 
the floodplains of river valleys, through river 
deltas, and where steep mountain streams enter 
quiet lakes or flow out onto a comparatively flat 
surface. When the deposit, in the course of its 
accumulation, takes the shape of a fan or cone, 
as at the base of a mountain, it is called an allu- 
vial fan. Among the great alluvial deposits of the 
world are the deltas of the Nile R. m Egypt, the 
Ganges R. in India, and the Hwang Ho R in 
China, and the floodplain of the Mississippi R. 
in North America (qq.v.) See Delta; Deposit; Ge- 
ology; River. Compare Erosion.

ALMA-ATA 


ALMA-ATA, city in the Soviet Union, and 
capital of the Kazakh S.S.R , in the n foothills of 
the Tien Shan Mts*, about ISO miles w of the 
border with China, and about 2QOO miles st of 
Moscow, located m the center of a fertile agri- 
cultural and orchard region, Alma-Ata is a mafor 
food-processing center. It is also the center of a 
motion-picture industry, and a major manufac- 
turing center for heavy machinery, cotton ami 
other textiles, champagne, and tobacco. The c ity 
is the site of several cultural and educational es- 
tablishments including the Kazakh and Russian 
opera houses, a large public library, a state uni- 
versity, and an academy of sciences. Founded as 
a Russian fort in 1855, the city was twice de- 
stroyed (1887, 1910) by earthquakes. It began to 
develop rapidly as an economic and manufac - 
tunng center in the 1920\ when it became the 
capital of the republic and the Turkestan-Sibc"- 
nan railway was built. Pop. (1970 est.) 730,000. 
ALMAGEST^ See Ptolemy (astronomer). 
ALMAGRO, Diego de (1475?-15ia), Spanish 
soldier and adventurer, born in Afmagro, near 
Ciudad Rea). He came to America in 1514, and 
settled in the new town of Panama five years 
later. In 1524 he formed a partnership with the 
Spanish explorer Francisco Pizarro (q.v.) to ex- 
plore and conquer the region on the coast of 
the Pacific Ocean south of Panama, which was 
reported to hold deposits of gold. In their first 
two expeditions (1524-25 and 1526), though 
beset by great hardships, they learned of the 
wealth of the Incan empire (see Inca; Peru: His- 
tory). in 1529 Pizarro was granted authority by 
Charles V (q.v.), Holy Roman Imperor, to con- 
quer and rule Peru, and in 1555 the partners 
completed the conquest of the country. In 1535 
Charles V appointed Almagro governor of New 
Toledo, an area lying south of Ptzarro*s grant 
and including the northern portion of present- 
day Chile. After invading and subfugatmg his 
lands in 1555-36, Almagro claimed that Cuzco 
(q.v.), the ancient Incan capital, lay within his 
region and entered the city as the legitimate 
governor. Consequently, a civil war broke out 
between the followers of Almagro and those of 
Pizarro. Pizarro's unsuccessful attempts to nego- 
tiate a peaceful seitlemertl were broken off m 
November, 1537, and in 1538 Almagro was 
captured and executed by Pizarro's forces. 
ALMANAC (Ar. a/ manikh, '"the weather"), 
book or table containing a calendar of days, 
weeks, months, and years, together with astro- 
nomical and navigational data and statistics and, 
often, church feasts and fasts, historical notes, 
condensed information on various other 
subjects, proverbs, and astrological and other 


foretaste, the wt>rd almanac was adopted from 
the Arabic bv the fnglish philosopher Roger 
Bacon (qA.), who used it in his encyclopedic 
work Opus Afa/us (1267), to designate a section 
devotinl to movements of thc^ celestial bodies 
farlv almanacs contained so much astrological 
and otht»r predic turns that they were commonly 
given the aflc^rnative title "prognostications^ 
About the iM'gmning of the Pith century the 
fashion for prediction dec ii ned, and two new 
types of almanac appeared the sc lentific alma- 
nac, or ephemeris, devoted enifrely to astro- 
nomical and navigational tables, and the infor- 
mational almanac . c^r vearlmok, containing the 
statistics, data, and other < ondensed matter. 

Compilations similar lo almanacs are known 
to have been made bv the anc lent f gyptians and 
Greeks of the Alexandrian Age (q.v.). The Ro- 
mans had « alendars known as fasti sacri, which 
somewhat res«*mbled mcKiern almanacs. In the 
Middle Ages manusc npi almanacs were circu- 
lated m fumpe, and clog almanacs (primitive 
calendars « arved on wood blocks) were used in

Unlike other early almanacs. ihe» contained no 
astrological prophecies In 151 i the French wri- 
ter Francois Ral>i*lais (qv.) published, at lyon, 
his almanac for that year, and subsequently 
published almanacs for t5iS, 1548, and 1550. 
The public atmn of predic lions grew to such an 
extent that in the 16th rentury, Henry III (q.v.), 
King of France, prohibiiCHl the msertion of poltt- 
kal prophecjes m almanacs; this prohibition 
was renewed by louts Kill (q.v.) m 1628, One of 
the imosi popular French almanacs was the Ah

the Alrmmrh Moysl was founded; as the Alma-

London guild of publishers). Under their pa- 
tronage, and with the imprimatur of the arch- 
bishop of Canterbury, flourished such produc-

ALMANAC 


Robm's Almanac (1664-1 824), and Moore's Al- 
manac In 1775 a decision of the Court of Com- 
mon Pleas abolished the monopoly, but the Sta- 
tioners' Company remained the principal 
publisher of almanacs in England The principal 
almanac is the British Almanac, first published 
in 1828 by the Society for the Diffusion of Use- 
ful Knowledge This publication was the first of 
the modern informational almanacs, containing 
factual data only. Other informational almanacs 
include The Statesman's Year-Book (1863) and 
Whitaker's Almanack (1868), both of which are 
devoted chiefly to political information 

In Scotland, Prognostications, published in 
Aberdeen, sold widely; about 1677 the annual 
circulation amounted to 50, OCX) copies. In 1683 
appeared Edinburgh's True Almanac, or a New 
Prognostication, which was soon followed by 
the Edinburgh Almanac. The latter has been 
published as a modern informational almanac 
since 1837 under the title of Oliver Sc Boyd's 
New Edinburgh Almanac. 

The earliest American almanac was that of the 
mariner William Pierce, published in Cam- 
bridge, Mass., in 1639. Better known was the al- 
manac of the colonial printer William Bradford 
(1663-1752), published m 1687 in Philadelphia, 
Pa., but most famous of early American alma- 
nacs was Poor Richard's Almanac, published by 
the American statesman Benjamin Franklin 
(qv) from 1732 to 1757 under the pen name 
Richard Saunders. The longest-lived American 
almanac is The Old Farmer's Almanac, which 
was first published in 1792 by the publisher 
Robert Bailey Thomas (1766-1846) and has re- 
tained its original format despite changes in 
ownership. In the mid-20th century it still pro- 
vides American farmers with information about 
agriculture, as well as with long-range weather 
forecasts, old jokes, homespun verses, and 
moral tales. In Boston the American Almanac 
and Repository of Useful Knowledge was 
started in 1828; it ceased publication in 1861. 
The American Almanac and Treasury of Facts 
was published from 1878 to 1889 by the librarian 
Ainsworth Rand Spofford (1825-1908). 

In the late 19th century numerous almanacs 
were published by newspapers. Of these alma- 
nacs the World Almanac, published from 1866 
to 1876 by the New York World, and revived in 
1886 by the American journalist Joseph Pulitzer 
(q.v.), and the Texas Almanac, founded in 1857 
by the Dallas Morning News, are still published 
today. The Chicago Daily News Almanac was 
founded m 1874 by the Chicago Daily News; it 
enjoyed widespread popularity for several dec- 
ades but ceased publication in 1937,

Scientific almanacs are published, usually 
under government sponsorship, for the benefit 
of astronomers and navigators. Several famous 
almanacs of this type, begun in the 17th and 
18th centuries, are still in use today. The oldest 
of these is the French Connaissance des Temps, 
started In 1679, and now published under the 
authority of the Bureau des Longitudes. In Great 
Britain, the Nautical Almanac was founded by 
the astronomer Nevii Maskelyne (1732-1811) 
and first published, with the authority of the 
British government, in 1767. The German Ber- 
liner Astronomisches Jahrbuch was started in 
1776 by the astronomer Johann Elert Bode (q.v.) 
Among leading present-day scientific almanacs 
IS the American Ephemeris and Nautical Alma- 
nac, founded by the American naval officer 
Charles Henry Davis (1807-77). It was first is-

founder of the dynasty was the Berber Abd-al- 
Mumm (about 1094-1163), who succeeded ibn- 
Tumart and took the title of caliph He con- 
quered Morocco and other parts of North Africa 
(1140-47), thus putting an end to the previous 
dynasty of the Almoravids (q v.) By 1154 he 
ruled also Islamic Spam and part of Portugal 
Notable among successive Almohad rulers was 
al-Mansur, who ruled in Spam from 1184 to 
1199, when he died He aided the sultan Saladin 
(q V.) against the Crusaders and was responsible 
for the construction of numerous architectural 
monuments. The Almohad dynasty flourished 
until 1212, when the united kings of Castile, Ar- 
ag6n, and Navarre defeated the Almohad forces 
m the Battle of Navas de Tolosa. Thereafter the 
power of the Almohads declined and finally 
came to an end m Spam in 1232 and in Africa m 
1269. See Spain: History; Brber 
ALMOND, common name for a small tree, 
Prunus amygdalus in the family Rosaceae, and 
for the fruit of the tree. The tree is characterized 
by the coarsely furrowed and wrinkled shell 
(called endocarp or putamen) of the drupe, and 
by the young leaves being conduplicate, or hav- 
ing their sides folded along the central vein. The 
almond tree resembles the peach tree; it grows 
to a height of about 20 to 30 ft. It is a native of 
western Asia, but now grows wild throughout 
the south of Europe, and is cultivated in the 
United States. The wood of the almond tree is 
hard, of reddish color, and is used by cabinet- 
makers. The almond is valued chiefly for the 
kernel of its fruit, the almond nut, which is an 
important article of commerce. Varieties of the 
almond are classified as either sweet or bitter. 
Sweet almonds contain a large quantity of a 
bland, fixed oil, emulsin, gum, and mucilage 
sugar; have an agreeable taste; and are nutri- 
tious. Bitter almonds contain the same sub- 
stances and, m addition, a crystalline glucoside 
called amygdalin. In commerce, the long al- 
monds of Malaga, known as jordon almonds, 
and the broad almonds of Valencia, are the most 
valued. 

The so-called dwarf almond (A. nana) is simi- 
lar to the common almond, except that it is a 
low shrub, seldom more than 2 or 3 ft. tall. Its 
fruit is also similar, but smaller, it is common m 
the plains of the south of the U.S.S.R, and is fre- 
quently planted as an ornamental shrub in Eng- 
land. Flowering almonds, shrubs or small trees, 
are cultivated extensively in the U.S. for their 
profusion of showy, white to rose blossoms. 
ALMORAVIDS or ALMORAVIDES, Berber 
dynasty that ruled m Africa and Spain in the 
11th and 12th centuries. Between 1053 and 1061 


a large part of northwestern Africa was subju- 
gated by the Muslim movement for religious re- 
form known as ''the hermits" (Ar. al-murabit) 
Leadership of the movement passed in 1061 to 
Yusuf ibn-Tashfln (d. 1106), a Berber chieftain 
who had previously conquered the region com- 
prising present-day Morocco In 1062 he as- 
sumed the title of king After enlarging their do- 
main in northwestern Africa, the Almoravids 
invaded Spam m 1086 and during the next four 
years conquered the area between the Tagus 
and Ebro rivers In 1147 the dynasty was over- 
thrown by the Almohads (q.v ), another Muslim 
reform movement 

ALMQVIST, Karl Jonas Ludvig (1793-1866), 
Swedish writer, born in Stockholm, and edu- 
cated at the University of Uppsala He gave up a 
post in the civil service to found a cooperative 
community in 1823, but after two years returned 
to Stockholm to become the rector of an experi- 
mental secondary school. In the mid-1830's he 
began to publish prose and verse works. His 
novels, short stories, poems, and verse dramas 
were collected in a series called Tornrosens Bok 
("The Book of the Thorn Rose", 14 vol., 1832- 
51). Almqvist's work marks the transition from 
Romanticism to realism (qq v ) m Swedish liter- 
ature His most important single work is Det Cir 
An ("It Will Do", 1839, Eng trans., Sara V/de- 
bec/c, 1919), a realistic story dealing with love 
and marriage. In 1851 Almqvist was charged 
with forgery and murder. He fled first to the 
United States and later to Bremen, Germany, 
where he lived for the rest of his life under the 
name of Professor Westermann 
ALNUS. See Aider 

ALOE, genus of plants m the Lily family (Liha- 
ceae). More than 150 species are known, mostly 
native to South Africa; they usually have short 
stems, fleshy, lanceolate leaves crowded m ro- 
settes at the end of the stem, and red or yellow 
tubular flowers in dense clusters. Species of 
Aloe vary m height from a few inches to 30 ft.; 
they are widely cultivated garden plants in trop- 
ical and subtropical regions and tub plants in 
cooler climates. Several species are of commer- 
cial importance as the source of the aloes used 
in medicine. The name aloe denotes also plants 
m the genus Agave (q.v ), the American aloe, or 
century plants. A, americana; and the false aloe, 
A, virginica.

(qq.v). The natural habitat ot the alpaca is the 
Andes Mts. in South America. It is most com 
monly kept m flocks by the Indians m the high 
lands of Peru and Chile. 

The alpaca is smaller than the llama, has 
longer, softer wool, and ordinarily ts not used as 
a beast of burden like the llama, it spits when 
angry A sure-footed animal, the alpaca resem- 
bles a large sheep, except for its elongated, 
erect neck. After eleven months gestation the 
female gives birth to one offspring. The young 
have short wool until they mature.

Flocks of alpacas graze almost wild on high 
plateaus, 14,000 to 16,000 ft. above sea level At 
shearing time the Indians drive them to the vil- 
lages and clip off about 8 in, of the wool. The al- 
paca provides white, gray, or yellow wool, al- 
though the black and dark-brown fibers are 
especially valued, The fiber is elastic and strong 
and fs straighter and more silky than the wool of 
sheep. Although the flesh of the alpaca is very 
palatable, the animal is kept primarily for its 
wool, from which a fine cloth is made.

AlPHABIT (from afpha and l)era. the first two 
letters of the Greek alphalxn). set of written 
symlK^fs, each representing a given sound or 
soumK which can be variously combined to 
represent all the wtmH ot a language. 

An alphabm attempts rdintlly lo indicate each 
separate sound by a separate symiKil, though 
this end is seldom atiamed Alphabets are dis- 
tinguished from syliabaries and from picio- 
graphit and ideographic systems, A syllabary 
represents each st*parate syllable (usually a 
si'quence of from one lo four spoken sounds 
pninouriied as m unmierrypted unit) by a sin- 
gle symlnd, |a|wies<% for example, has two com- 
plete syflahaoes. the hiragana and the kafakana. 
A pHiographic system represents picturable 
obfects, lor example, a drawing of the sun 
stands lor the sprtken word ^*syn*7 An ideo- 
graphic system combim^ various pictographs 
for the purpose of indMating nonpicturable 
ideas fhus, the Chinese pictographs for ''sun''

converts such a tytiem into an alphabet or sylla-

standing originally for the entire word beth and 
later for the sound of b, ultimately became the b 
of the English alphabet. 

It is generally supposed that the original Se- 
mitic alphabet, the first known alphabet, devel- 
oped from a combination of cuneiform and hi- 


eroglyphic symbols; some symbols might have 
been taken from kindred systems, such as the 
Cretan and Hittite. The Semitic alphabet con- 
sisted exclusively of consonants The vowel 
sounds of a word had to be supplied by the 
speaker or reader. The present-day Hebrew and

alphabet 


Arabic alphabets still <t>nMst ol consonantal let 
ters only, however, vowels may be mciicatecl in 
writing by optional vowel points and dashes 
placed below, above, or to the side of the c on 
sonant (see SfMiiic UnciUAcas). 

About \000 BC the Semitic alphabet was 
adopted by the Greeks Its twenty dwo conso 
nantal symbols were expanded to twenty four 
(an even greater number appears m some Greek 
dialects), and some of the original consonantal 
symbols were set apart to serve exclusively as 
vowels {seeOmK Ianguaci)- The Greek alpha 
bet spread throughout the Mediterranean 
world, giving rise to various modified forms, 
Among these were the Etruscan, Osc an, Um 
brian, and Roman alphabets. Because of the 
spread of the Latin language, the Roman alpha 
bet eventually became the alphabet of all the 
languages of western Europe. 

About 900 A.t> Greek missionaries from Con 
stantinople (now Istanbul, Turkey) converted 
the Slavs to Christianity and devisecJ for them a 
system of writing known as Cyrillic (see Cv«ietic 
AiPHABir) from the name of one of its inventors, 
the Apostle to the Slavs, Saint Cyril (q.v.), The 
Cyrillic, like the Roman alphabet, stems from 
the Greek; however, additioisal charac ters wcw 
devised to represent Slavic sounds that had no 
Greek equivalents. The CyriilK alphabet, in van 
ous forms, is used presently m Russian, UKram 
ian, Serbian, and Sutgarlan, but not in Polish. 
Czech, Slovak, Croatian, or Slovenian, whic h use* 
modified Roman alphabets. 

The Arabic alphabet, another offshoot of ih«* 
early Semitic one, has spread to sue h languages 
as Persian and Urdu, and is generally used by 
peoples following the Islamic faith. The qws* 
tlon arises whether the various aiphab«*ts of 
India and southeastern Asia are indigenous de 
velopments or offshoots of early Semiiic. One 
of the most important Indian alphal>eis, the ih* 
vanagari alphabet used m Sanskrit (see SANSxitit 
Language) is an ingenious combination of syl 
labic and true alphabetic principles. The pro 
genitors, whether Semitic or Indian, of the De- 
vanagari alphabet seem also to have given rise 
to the written languages of Bengali, Tamil, 
Telugu, Singhalese, Burmese, and Siamese, or 
Thai. 

Any alphabet used by peoples speaking dif- 
ferent languages undergoes modification!. Such 
is the case with respect both to the number and 
form of tetters used and to the subscripts and 
superscripts (accents, cedillas, tildes, dots, and 
others) used with the basic symbols lo indicate 
modifications of sound. The letter c with a ce- 
dilla, for instance, appears regularly in French,

edge of the crescent is approximately 470 mi , 
and along the outer edge, about 810 mi The 
width of the crescent ranges from 80 mi. near 
Mont Blanc (see Blanc, Mont), France, to 150 
mi , jUSt N of Verona, Italy. The interior of the 
crescent encloses the extensive basin of the Po 
R. and the Adriatic Sea 

The Alps system includes hundreds of peaks, 
such as Matterhorn (q.v ), exceeding 10,000 ft , 
and in the Valais Alps of Switzerland, several 
peaks reach 15,000 ft. Mont Blanc (15,771 ft ) is 
the highest. The Alps have the most extensive 
glaciers of the European mainland. 

In the extreme ne, where the Alpine system 
reaches the Danube R , it is met by a range be- 
longing to the Carpathian Mts. (q.v.); in the se 
the Alps are continued by the Dmaric Alps (q 
V.). In the s the Alps meet the Apennines (q.v ), 
which extend through the Italian peninsula into 
Sicily. On the w., near Lake Bourget m France, 
the Alps merge with the Jura (q v.) Mts , a sepa- 
rate spur of the Alpine mountain system. The 
term Alpine mountain system, in its structural 
meaning, includes the Sierra Nevada of south- 
ern Spain, the Pyrenees (q.v.), the Atlas Moun- 
tains (q.v ) of N Africa, the Apennines, the Di- 
nanc Alps of Yugoslavia and Greece, the 
Rhodope (q.v.) Mts. of Greece, the Taurus Mts. 
and Anatolian chains of Turkey, and the Carpa- 
thians, including the Transylvanian Alps and the 
Balkan Mountains (q.v.). 

GEOLOGY OF THE ALPS 
Structurally the Alps resulted from the folding of 
sediments between the Eurasian foreland and 
the African land mass; see Geology: Formation 
of Mountains; Mountains. Weathering and de- 
nudation have sculptured the Alps into the 
youthful forms visible today. With the excep- 
tion of certain areas of s.e. Austria and of the re- 
gion of Provence, France, the whole Alpine 
mountain system was at one time covered by 
ice. As temperatures became warmer, glacial ac- 
tion formed moraines, U-shaped valleys, pyram- 
idal peaks, and Alpine cirques (see Glacier). De- 
nudation resulted in broad, steep-walled 
hanging valleys, polished boulders, and many 
tongue-shaped basins blocked by morainic de- 
posits at their outward ends.

The Alps are commonly divided into two parts, 
which have very different topographic charac- 
teristics. The line of division runs s from the 
Lake of Constance (q.v.), on the northern border 
of Switzerland, up the Rhine valley, crossing 
SplOgen (q.v.) Pass on the Italo-Swiss border, to 


Lake Como (q v.) m Italy. The western Alps are 
narrower and higher, with more and longer gla- 
ciers and deeply incised valleys, Mont Blanc is 
the highest peak Most of Switzerland falls 
within the western Alps 

The ranges and ridges of the western Alps are 
broken and irregular, whereas in the other parts 
of the system the secondary ranges are com- 
monly parallel to the axis of the system It is 
further subdivided into ranges separated from 
one another more or less completely by stream 
gorges and depressions 

French Alps. The French Alps, part of the 
western Alps, are located in the se corner of 
France. They are bordered on the s by the Med- 
iterranean coast and on the n by the Lake of 
Geneva (q v ), and extend toward the Rhdne R 
corridor in the w and to the upper Po-Adnatic 
basin in the e and ne The French Alps may be 
divided into the Maritime Alps, Ligurian Alps, 
Cottian Alps, Dauphin^ Alps, Graian Alps, and 
Savoy Alps 

The Maritime Alps lie n of and parallel to the 
Riviera (q.v.), the Franco-ltalian coast of the Lig- 
urian Sea The chief Maritime peak is Punta Ar- 
gentera (10,817 ft ) in Italy. In Liguria (q v ), a re- 
gion of northern Italy, the Maritime Alps merge 
with the Ligurian Alps, the chief peak of which 
is Monte Saccarello (7216 ft) on the Franco-ltal- 
lan border. 

The Cottian Alps he along the Franco-ltalian 
border beyond the Maritime Alps, the highest 
peak IS Monte Viso (12,601 ft ) in Italy. The Dau- 
phin^ Alps, a branch of the Cottian Alps, extend 
w. from the latter range into the Dauphin^ (q.v.) 
region of France, the chief peak is Les Ecrins 
(13,461 ft.) in France. 

The Graian Alps extend in an arc along the 
Franco-ltalian border from Mont Cenis Pass (see 
Cenis, Mont) on the s.w. to Little Saint Bernard 
Pass (see Saint Bernard) on the w., the highest 
peak is Gran Paradiso (13,323 ft.) in Italy The 
Savoy Alps, an extension of the Graian Alps, ex- 
tend n. to the Lake of Geneva; the chief peak is 
Mont Blanc. 

Swiss Alps. In Switzerland the Alps occupy 
roughly 58 percent of the surface of the country, 
but only about 18 percent of the population 
lives there. The longitudinal (e -w ) trough of the 
Rhdne and Rhine rivers divides the Swiss Alps 
into northern and southern parts. The northern 
Alps are usually divided into the Bernese Alps, 
between the Lake of Geneva and the Aare R., 
the Vierwaldst^tter Alps, between the Aare and 
Reuss valleys; the Glarner or Glarus Alps, be- 
tween the Reuss and Rhine valleys; and the Ap- 
penzell Alps, between the Lake of Wallenstadt

and the Lake of Constance. The main chain of 
the Bernese Alps is 68 mi. long and has the larg- 
est number of glaciers m the Alps. The longest 
(16 mi.) Alpine glacier, Aletsch (q.v.) glacier, is 
located n of Brig in the Rhdne valley; lower 
Grindelwald glacier descends to the lowest ele- 
vation (3500 ft.). Finsteraarhorn (q.v.), 14,022 ft. 
high, IS the highest peak of the Bernese Alps, 
and the well-known peak of the Jungfrau (q.v.), 
13,642 ft., IS nearby. 

The southern Alps of Switzerland are divided 
into four main chains: the Valais Alps, or the 
Pennine Alps, between the Great Saint Bernard 
Pass (see Saint Bernard) and the Simplon (q.v.) 
Pass; the Ticino Alps and the Lepontinc Alps 
(q.v.), which are pierced by the Saint Gotthard 
(q.v.) tunnel and pass; the Adula Alps, w of 
Splugen Pass; and the Rhaetian Alps or Gnsons 
Alps, which cover most of GraubOnden Canton 
and form the connecting link with the central 
Alps of Austria. 

The Jura Mts, an extension of the western 
(French) Alps, extend along the Franco-Swiss 
border from the Rhdne R, in the sw to the 
Rhine R. in the n e, The highest point is Crdt de 
la Neige (5653 ft.) m the sw part, just inside 
France. 

BASTERN ALPS 

The Alps to the t of the dividing line are 
broader and lower than the western Alps Their 
longitudinal valleys are wider and contain a 
number of targe cities. The highest peak is Piz 
Bernina (13,303 ft.) in GraubOnden Canton, 
Switzerland. All of Austria lies in the eastern 
Alps. The Austrian Alps are divided by three lon- 
gitudinal valley troughs into the northern lime- 
stone Alps, the central Alps, and the southern 
limestone Alps. 

Northern Limestone Alps. The northern lime- 
stone Alps form a belt of varying width across 
the northern parts of the provinces Vorarlberg, 
Tirol, Salzburg, and Upper Austria, terminating 
at the Wienerwald, w of Vienna. The Alps be- 
come wider toward the ( and consist of many 
sharp peaks, barren high plateaus, and relatively 
few valleys. The outer (eastern) zone, called 
Flysch zone, is characterized by gentle slopes 
and many valleys and pastures, Zugspitze (^1 
ft.), the highest peak, is located nw of Inns- 
bruck on the German border, and the highest 
point of the mountain lies within Germany. In 
Germany the Alps are limited to an outer strip 
of the northern limestone Alps between the 
Lake of Constance and Salzburg, Austria. Some 
of the better-known mountain chains within 
this division are the Ailglu Alps, lechtai Alps, 
and Bavarian Alps, or North Tirol Alps. 


Central Alps. The lontral Alps of Austria are 
separated from the northern limestone zone by 
a longitudinal valley extending from the Rhine 
R. in Vorarlberg Provime, auoss the Arlberg 
Pass to the valleys of the Inn, Salzach, and Enns 
rivers, and from there to the valley of the Murz 
R. and over the Semmertng Pass to the Vienna 
Basin Many transverse valleys open into this im- 
portant I -w highway fhe central Alps consist 
of numerous mountain chains, with few high- 
ways and tunnels through them; they begin at 
the transverse division that separates the eastern 
Alps from the western Alps and extend to the 
Non< Alps of eastern Austria, Some of the well- 
known mountain chains are the Otztal Alps, the 
Zitlertat Alps and fhe Hohe lauern and Niedere 
Tauern ranges The highest peak is Grossgtock- 
ner (12,457 ft ) near the border of Tirol, Carin- 
thia, and Salzburg provinces. 

Southern Alps. I he southern longitudinal val- 
ley runs from I ake Como, Italy, along the upper 
Adda R. to the valleys of the Adige and Isarco 
rivers, and from there along the Orau R. in Aus- 
tria. The Klagenfurt Basm, a densely settled and 
highly cultivated depression, lies between the 
central Alps and the southern limestone Alps, s. 
of which are the Carnic Alps, the Karawanken 
range along the Austro- Yugoslav border, the Ju- 
lian Alps m Italy and Yugoslavia, and the Dinaric 
Alps leading st Generally the peaks of this zone 
do not attain the elevations of fhe central Alps. 
The only important through routes are offered 
by the vallevs of the Adige, Tagliamento, and 
Sava rivers and. in the t , the Drava R. The Dolo- 
mite Alps (q.v.), a separate spur of limestone 
mountains in the inner arc of the Alps, are 
known for their bizarre towers and crags and for 
the straight while and pink walls of the moun- 
tains above the Alpine pastures. 

ALPtNE ROUTES 

Despite the difficult terrain, the Alps offer a 
number of transit routes, some of which have 
been important since prehistoric times. Rail- 
roads follow all the Important old transalpine 
routes, with tunnels through the most difficult 
stretches, i( is rsow possible to cross any part of 
the Alps by train in less than four hours. 

Al|]4fi« fmm. A number of relatively low 
passes traverse the Alps. From w to £ the most 
important include Tenda Past (5637 ft.) on the 
Franco-ltalian border and Monigen^vre Pass 
(5562 ft.) in France, both of which are open all 
year; Mont Cenis Pass (6831 ft.) arsd Little St. 
Bernard Pass (7177 ft.) on the Franco-Swiss bor- 
der, both of which are closed in winter. On the 
ttalo-Swiss border in the nw bend of the cres- 
cent is the Great St. Bernard Pass (Bin ft.).

Closed during the winter are Simplon Pass (6950 
ft.), St. Gotthard Pass (6935 ft.), Furka Pass (7299 
ft.), Oberalp Pass (6133 ft.), all of which are in 
Switzerland; Spliigen Pass (6946 ft.) on the Italo- 
Swiss border; and Grossglockner-Hochtor Pass 
(7725 ft.). Arlberg Pass (5900 ft.), connecting the 
Austrian provinces of Vorarlberg and Tirol, and 
Brenner Pass (q.v.), 4494 ft., between the prov- 
ince of Tirol and Italy, are of importance for 
both rail and motor traffic. 

Alpine Tunnels. Four important, recently 
opened avalanche- proof motor roads penetrate 
the Alps by tunnel and permit all-year passage. 
In order of completion they are: Great Saint Ber- 
nard Road Tunnel, 3.6 mi. long, completed In 
1964, connecting Martigny, Switzerland, with 
Aosta, Italy; Mont Blanc Tunnel, 7.2. mi. long, 
completed in 1%5, which shortens the route be- 
tween Chamonix, France, and Courmayeur, 
Italy, by about 60 mi.; Felbertauern Tunnel, 7443 
ft. high and 3 mi. long, completed in 1%7, con- 
necting the Austrian provinces of eastern Tirol 
and Salzburg; and the tunnel, 4.1 mi, long, under 
the San Bernardino Pass (6195 ft. high) between 
Hinterrhein and San Bernardino, Switzerland.

Charlemagne (qv.), King of the Franks^ m 817 
and 843, Alsace became at first part of Lotharm- 
gia, the kingdom of Lothair (q v.). In 925 Alsace 
became part of the German duchy of Swabia or 
Alemannia and was absorbed into the Holy 
Roman Empire, of which it remained a part for 
some 800 years. It remained a German posses- 
sion until the 17th century, and during this pe- 
riod strong feudal principalities controlled 
largely by the Hapsburg (qv.) rulers of Austria 
emerged. A number of rich and powerful towns, 
such as Strassburg and Kolmar, developed in the 
late Middle Ages and won status as free towns 
or miniature republics By the terms of the 
Peace of Westphalia in 1648, which concluded 
the Thirty Years' War, Alsace was placed under 
the sovereignty of France; see Westphalia, Peace 
OF. Thereafter Alsace constituted a province of 
the kingdom of France until the French Rev- 
olution, when Alsace was split into the de- 
partments of Bas-Rhin and Haut-Rhin These 
departments, together with Lorraine, were in- 
corporated into the German Empire after the 
Franco-German War (q.v.) of 1870-71 For sub-

consists of the departments of Bas Rhin, Haul- 
Rhin, Moselle, and Meurthe*et-Moselle. The 
chief cities are Strasbourg, Mulhouse, Met/, and 
Nancy. 

After the breakup of the empire of the Holy 
Roman emperor Charlemagne (q.v.) m the 9th 
century, the region became the object of dis- 
putes between French and Germanic rulers, 
passing from the control of one to the other. 
The term Alsace-Lorraine was first used m 1871, 
when, by the terms of the Peace T reaty of f rank 
furl concluding the Franco-German War fq.v ), 
the former provinces of Alsace and Lorraine 
(qq.v,), which had been under French rule since 
the middle of the 17th century, were annexed 
by Germany. They v^ere returned to France tn 
1919, after World War I, by the terms of the 
Treaty of Versailles; see Virsaiub, Triaivoi Dur- 
ing World War 11, under the terms of the armi- 
stice of 1940 between France and Germany, the 
territory was ceded to Germany, but France re- 
gained It after the defeat of Germany in IW. 

The German-speaking population is centered 
chiefly in Alsace; the French-speaking, chiefly in 
Lorraine. In many respects, however, the c yfture 
of the whole region is uniform, containing eie 
ments of both the French and German. At van 
ous times autonomy movements have F)een me 
tiated, directed against Germany between 1871 
and World War I, and against France after World 
War I. The sentiment of the region, however, 
during both World Wars was markedly pro 
French. C.W.FI

ALTDORFER, Albrecht (about 1480-1538), 
German painter, architect, and copper- and 
wood-engraver. Although his birthplace is un- 
known, he spent most of his life in Regensburg 
(q.v.) as city architect and life member of the 
city council. 

Altdorfer is important to the history of paint- 
ing as a founder and leading master of the Dan- 
ube school. His pictures are characterized by an 
evocative imagination, ranging from the playful 
to the grandiose and from the picturesque to 
the fantastic. He produced some of the earliest 
pure landscapes of European art, in which na- 
ture was portrayed as both fanciful and realistic. 
Although his drawing is structurally weak, Alt- 
dorfer is unsurpassed as a colorist. 

One of his best works is a great altarpiece 
(1518) in the monastery of Saint Florian in Enns, 
Austria. His famous ''Victory of Alexander at Ar- 
bela" (1529) so captivated the french emperor 
Napoleon I (q.v.) that he ordered it taken to

Pans later it was returned to the PmakotheL in 
Munich, Germany, which also possesses, among 
other works, Altdorfer's exquisite little '"Saint 
George m a Lancisc ape" (ISIO) and "Susanna's 
Bath" (1526). Paintings by Altdorfer m the Berlin 
Museum include "Repose on the flight to 
Egypt" (1510), "Beggary Sitting on the' Tram ot 
Pride" (1531), and a "Nativity" (about 1512). 

Altdorfer's skill as a graphic artist entitles him 
to a place among the so-called little Masters, a 
group of 16th-century German engravers noted 
for their expert execution of designs on a small 
scale. His graphic style was influenced by the 
German painter and engraver Albrecht Purer 
(qv.). Altciorfer's prints include an outstanding 
senes of nine etched landscapes. R.S.M 

ALTERNATION OF GENERATIONS, occur 
fence of two or more alternating forms m the 
life cycle of plants. All but the simpk^st of plants 
undergo a life cycle of two kinds of generatior^s 
Among the algae (q.v.) two variations of this 
cycle are found: (1) a life cycle in whic h the two 
generations are similar in structure and appear 
ance, and (2) one in which the* two generatiom 
are completely different. In other plants higher 
than algae the two generations are fundamen 
tally different m structure and appearance. 

In all cases, the alternating generations are a 
sexual one, called the gametophyle, and an 
asexual one, called the sporophyte. The gameto 
phyte generation produces gametes (eggs and 
sperm) which fuse (see fnoiu/AiiONh rise 
to the sporophyte generation. The essential 
characteristic of the sporophyte is that its repro 
ductfve cells or spores are asexual; each spore 
germinates to produce a gamelophyie. 

Among the mosses (q.v.) and liverworts (sec* 
Htf^ATiCAi) the gametophytic generation is the 
conspicuous form; the sporophyte cannot exist 
independently. The sporophyte of the moss is 
composed of a capsule, which is the center of 
spore formation; a stalk; and a foot that atiat'hes 
the sporophyte body to the tip of the gameto- 
phyte. 

The gametophyte and the gametes that it pro^ 
duces are both haploid, that Is, they contain half 
the number of chromosomes that Is characteris- 
tic of the species. When the egg and sperm fuse, 
they form a diploid sporophyte, that is, il has 
twice the haploid number of chromosomes 
When the process of meiosis ^curs withm the 
sporangia of the sporophyte the diploid chro* 
mosome number is reduced again to the hap- 
loid slate. See Cat: Cel/ DMsion, 

Among plants higher than the ferns, such as 
pines, cycads (see CYCAOACfAi), artd flowering 
plants, the gametophyte does not occur as an 


indeptVKlenf plant ihe %parnphyte is the con-

altitude measurement is not a linear distance, 
but rather the angle between the plane of the 
horizon and a line drawn from the eye to the 
heavenly body, or the arc of a vertical circle in- 
tercepted between the heavenly body and the 
horizon. Altitudes are measured in observatories 
by means of a telescope attached to a vertical 
circle on which degrees are marked. With the 
telescope aimed at the heavenly body, the angle 
that the telescope makes with the horizon is 
read from the graduated circle The altitude thus 
observed is corrected for such factors as parallax 
(q v.) and refraction (see Optics) in order to ob- 
tain the true altitude. 

In physical geography, altitude refers to eleva- 
tion above mean sea level, as indicated, for 
example, by the heights of mountains This 
measurement is determined most accurately by 
triangulation with optical instruments; see Trig- 
onometry The altitude of an airplane, however, 
IS measured most accurately by means of a radio 
altimeter, an instrument which relies on radar 
(q.v.) and is considerably more accurate than a 
conventional altimeter; see Navigation: Elec- 
tronic Aids to Navigation.

ALTMAN, Benjamin (1840"«1913), American 
merchant, art collector, and philanthropist, born 
m New York City. After a public-school educa- 
tion, he worked in the small store established by 
his father in the lower East Side, Altman worked 
in small stores after the death of his father, but 
in 1865 he opened a dry goods store of his own 
m New York City. His business steadily in- 
creased in scale and became one of the largest 
department-store enterprises in the world; in

ALUM, colorless mixed salt, KAI(S(>4)i-l2H/>, 
also called potassium alum, which deposits 
from solution in large octahedral or cubic crys 
tals when potassium sulfate and aluminum sul- 
fate are dissolved together and the solution is 
cooled. Solutions of alum are slightly acidic. 

Alum IS soluble in ten times its weight of 
water at room temperature and is very soluble 
in hot water. When dry crystalline alum is 
heated, some of the water of hyciration l>e 
comes chemically separated, and the partly 
dehydrated salt dissolves m this water, so that 
the alum appears to melt at about 90"* C. (194^ 
F.). When heated to about 200® C. (192® f ), 
alum swells up, loses all the water and some sul 
fur trioxide, and becomes a basic salt talk'd 
burnt alum. A substance called neutral alum is 
produced when an alum solution is neutfali/tul 
either with sodium carbonate or with aluminum 
hydroxide. 

Alum was probably known in pre-Christian 
times. Until about 1600 it was made by heaimg 
a mineral, alunite, and extracting the product 
with water, yielding a solution of alum ancj a 
residue of alumina, In later times more' common 
minerals were used, which recjutred treatment 
with sulfuric acid or potash to prcKJute alum. At 
present alum and related substances are pre^ 
pared from aluminum sulfate, which is made 
from bauxite and sulfuric acid. 

Aluminum sulfate (sometimes incorrectly 
called alum) and alum are similar in their 
properties and have simtiar uses. Alummum sul* 
fate is used as a mordant in dyeing, as a floccU” 
fating agent in the purification of water and 
sewage, in the sizing of paper, and m the manu- 
facture of plaster and textiles. Where a very pure 
product IS desired, alum is substituted; it is used 
in the flame-proofing of textiles, in baking pow* 
ders, in mordants for delicate dyeing opera- 
tions, and in medicines. It is a powerful astrin- 
gent and styptic; the ordinary styptic pencil 
used by shavers to stop bleeding from small cuts 
is usually made entirely of alum. Neuiral alum 
sometimes replaces alum as a mordant, and 
burnt alum is sometimes used in medicine.

ALUMINUM (in Canada and Europe, alumin-

m.p. 659° C. (1218.2° F,), sp.gr. 2.70^0°, and sym- 
bol Al, Aluminum is the most abundant metallic 
constituent in the crust of the earth; only the 
nonmetals oxygen and silicon are more abun- 
dant. Aluminum has never been found as a free 
metal; it occurs most commonly as aluminum 
silicate or as a silicate of aluminum mixed with 
other metals such as sodium, potassium, iron, 
calcium, and magnesium. These silicates are not 
useful ores, for it is chemically difficult, and 
therefore an expensive process, to extract alu- 
minum from them. Bauxite (q.v.), an impure hy- 
drated aluminum oxide, is the commercial 
source of aluminum and its compounds.

ist, first isolated aluminum in 1825, using a 
chemical process involving potassium amalgam. 
Betwen 1827 and 1845 Friedrich Wohler (q v ), a 
German chemist, improved Oersted's process 
by using metallic potassium. He was the first to 
measure the specific gravity of aluminum and 
show Its amazing lightness. In 1854 Henri 
Sainte-Claire Deville (q.v.), in France, obtained 
the metal by reducing aluminum chloride with 
sodium. Aided by the financial backing of Na- 
poleon 111, Deville established a large-scale ex- 
perimental plant and displayed pure aluminum 
at the Paris Exposition of 1855. In 1886 Charles 
Martin Hall (q.v,) in the United States and Paul 
L T. H6roult (1863-1914) in France independ- 
ently and almost simultaneously discovered that 
alumina (q.v.), or aluminum oxide, would dis- 
solve In fused cryolite (Na^AIF^) and could then 
be decomposed electrolytically to a crude mol- 
ten metal. A low-cost technique, the Hall-H^r- 
oult process is still the only method used for the 
commercial production of aluminum The purity 
of the product has been increased until a com- 
mercially pure ingot is 99.5 percent pure alumi- 
num; It may be further refined to 99.99 percent,

ALVARADO 


In 1886 the world production of alummum 
was less than 100 lb., and its price was more 
than $5.00 per lb. In the mtd-1970's the U S an- 
nual production alone was over 4,900,000 short 
tons of primary alummum; its price was about 
34 cents per lb. Worl^ output was more than 
14,500,000 short tons in the same period. U.S, 
consumption of aluminum, by major markets, 
was as follows: building and construction, 22 6 
percent; transportation, 17.8 percent; containers 
and packaging, 16 6 percent; electrical equip- 
ment, 13.5 percent; consumer durables, 8,5 per- 
cent; machinery and equipment, 7.6 percent; ex- 
ports, 6.9 percent, and miscellaneous, 6 5 
percent. 

Alummum is a strongly electropositive metal 
and extremely reactive. In contact with air, alu- 
mmum rapidly becomes covered with a tough, 
transparent layer of oxide that resists further 
corrosive action. For this reason, materials made 
of aluminum do not tarnish or rust. The metal 
reduces other metallic compounds to their base 
metals. For example, when thermite, a mixture 
of powdered aluminum and iron oxide, is 
heated, the aluminum rapidly removes the oxy- 
gen from the iron; the heat of the reaction is 
sufficient to melt the iron. This phenomenon is 
used m the thermite process for welding iron. 
See Welding, 

The oxide of aluminum is amphoteric, show- 
ing both acidic and basic properties m approxi- 
mately equal degrees. The most important com- 
pounds are the oxide, hydroxide; sulfate, and 
mixed sulfate compounds; see Alum. Anhydrous 
aluminum chloride is an important salt' used in 
the oil and synthetic-chemical industries, Man^ 
gemstones {see Gem), ruby and sapphire, for ex- 
ample, consist mainly of crystalline aluminum 
oxide. 

A given volume of aluminum weighs less than 
one third as much as the same volume of steel. 
The only lighter metals are lithium, beryllium, 
and magnesium. Its high strength -to- weight ra- 
tio makes aluminum useful in the construction 
of aircraft, railroad cars, and automobiles and 
for other applications in which mobility is im- 
portant More than 70 lb. of aluminum are used 
in the average automobile. Because of Its high 
heat conductivity, aluminum is used in cooking 
utensils and in the pistons of internal-combus- 
tion engines. Aluminum has only 63 percent of 
the electrical conductance of copper for wire of 
a given size, but it weighs less than half as 
much. An aluminum wire of comparable con- 
ductance to a copper wire is thicker but still 
lighter than the copper. Weight is a particularly 
important factor m long-distance, high-voltage 


power transmission, and aluminum conductors 
are now used to transmit electricity at 700,000 
volts or more. 

The metal is becoming increasingly important 
architecturally, for both structural and ornamen- 
tal purposes. It is also used as a material in low- 
temperature nuclear reactors because it absorbs 
relatively few neutrons Aluminum becomes 
stronger and retains its toughness as it gets 
colder and is therefore used at cryogenic tem- 
peratures. Aluminum foil 0 007 in thick, now a 
common household convenience, protects food 
and other perishable items from spoilage Be- 
cause of its light weight, ease of forming, and 
compatibility with foods and beverages, alumi- 
num IS used increasingly for containers, flexible 
packages, and easy-to-open bottles and cans. Its 
resistance to corrosion in salt water makes it 
useful in boat hulls and varied aquatic devices. 

A wide variety of alloys can be prepared that 
give the metal different properties. Some new 
aluminum alloys are so strong that they can be 
used as armor plate for tanks, personnel earners, 
and other military vehicles S.Z L.

ALVA, Fernando Alvarez de Toledo or ALBA^ 
Fernando Alvarez de Toledo, Duke of 
(1508-B3?), Spanish general of noble family He 
rose to prominence as commander of the armies 
of Charles V (q.v.). Holy Roman Emperor, and 
gained a brilliant victory for Charles ©ver Elector 
John Frederick (1503-54) of Saxony at MQhIberg 
in 1547. In Charles' Italian campaign against the 
French and papal forces Alva overran the States 
of the Church, but after the abdication of 
Charles V, Philip II (q.v.), King of Spam, gave up 
these conquests. Alva was appointed captain 
general of the Netherlands in 1567, with author- 
ity to repress the Dutch revolt against Spain (see 
Netherlands, The: History), He promptly set up a 
tribunal, known as the Blood Council, which 
condemned the rebels and confiscated their 
property without regard to legal procedure. 
Among the best known victims were the Flem- 
ish statesmen Lamoral Egmont (qv.) and Philip 
de Montmorency Horn (1518-68). Alva's troops 
defeated the Flemish forceis and on Dec 22, 
1568, triumphantly entered Brussels. In Antwerp 
he set up a statue of himself trampling two fig- 
ures representing the nobles and people of the 
Netherlands, Alva himself claimed to have 
caused the execution of 18,(XX) men. His tyranny 
intensified the Dutch resistance, however,*and 
he was recalled in 1573. In 1580 he conquered 
Portugal with characteristic cruelty.

AMALFI, picturesque town of Italy, m Salerno 
Province, Campania Region, 24 miles s.l of

Today Amalfi is a small fishing port and 
tourist resort. In the 9th century, however, It was 
a powerful maritime republic, competing with 
Venice, Pisa, and Genoa in trade and sending Its 
ships as far as India. Its maritime code, one of 
the earliest known, was widely recognized 
around the Mediterranean basin until well into 
the 16th century. After the 12th century, when 
Amalfi was annexed by King Roger II of Sicily 
(1131) and then sacked by the Pisans (1135 and 
1137), it gradually declined as a commercial and 
naval power. 

One of Amatfi^s chief points of interest Is the 
cathedral, which was begun in the 9th century 
and repeatedly remodeled. Especially admired 
are its splendid bronze doors, cast in Constanti- 
nople in about 1066. Another notable site is an 
old Capuchin convent, founded in 1212 and 
now used as a hotel, Amalfi is renowned for Its 
natural beauty. Pop. (1971) 6136.

AMARANTH, common name for any flower- 
ing plants with blossoms that do not readily 
fade when picked, and especially to.</|>lants of 
the genus Amaranthus The genps contains 
about fifty species, most of which^^are found in 
the tropics. They are herbs or shj^bs, with sim- 
ple leaves, and flowers in heads or spikes The 
spikes are sometimes several feet in length. Be- 
cause the dry red bracts which surround the 
flower retain their freshness long after the flow- 
ers are gathered, poets regard the plant as a 
symbol of immortality. The annual weeds, pig- 
weed (A. retroflexus) and tumbleweed (A. grae- 
clzans), of the United States are of this genus. 
The globe amaranth, Comphrena globosa, is 
cultivated in Roman Catholic countries for 
adorning churches in winter. Its flowers, which 
are a shining purple color, retain their beauty 
and freshness for several years. See Everlastings 
AMARILLO, city of Texas, in Potter and Ran- 
dall counties, county seat of Potter Co., and the 
largest city in^the Panhandle area, about 305 
miles N.w. of Ft. Worth. It is served by four air- 
lines and by three railroad lines. The sur- 
rounding region produces cattle and gram and 
has oiL natural gas, and helium fields. Amarillo 
contains railroad shops, foundries, zinc smeJA»« 
ers, and the largest helium plant in the '«rid. 
The city was incorporated m 1887 Pop. (1960)

AMARYLLIS 


amaryllis^ genus ot bulbous rooted herbs 
of the Amaryllis family (Amar>//fda<4*ae), em 
bracing a large number of species, native to the 
tropical regions. The most common species is 
the belladonna lily, Amaryiiib bell^donn^f a 
South African plant with showy, hiylike flowers 
Many horticultural forms are grown with fk^w 
ers ranging In color from white to red m diverse 
shapes and sizes. Another popular spec les is the 
Barbados hly, A, v/rrata, of Peru, which bears 
white flowers with red, feathery stripes. Both

AMATEUR ATHLETIC UNION OF THE 
UNITED STATES, known as the A.A.U., na 
tional nonprofit organization founded m 18BS 
and comprising groups interested m the deckel* 
opment and improvement of activities for ama^ 
teur athletes. The A.A.U, defines an amateur 
athlete as '"one who engages m sport for pleas 
ure . . . and to whom sport is nothing more 
than an avocation*'. Membership is limited to 
such permanent organizations as chamt>ers ot 
commerce and the Young Men's Christian Asso- 
ciation, and to high schools, colleges, and ath- 
letic clubs. The constitution of the* A.AU 
eludes the following obfectives: to foster 
physical education, to conduct athkmc contests 
and provide awards for them, to arrange inter 
national competitions, to develop sports and 
recreational facilities for the public, and to 
maintain a uniform standard for the eligibility of 
athletes as amateurs. For the accompfishmeni of 
these goals the A.A.U. conducts nationwide ath 
letic competitions for boys and girls. In federa 
lions with similar organizations abroad the 
AAU, helps to set standards for such interna* 
tional athletic competitions as the Olympic 
Games (q.v.). 

Among the amateur sports under the jurisdic - 
tion of the A.A.U. are basketball, bobsledding, 
boxing, gymnastics, handball, judo, luge {small- 
sled competition), swimming, track and field, 
volleyball, water polo, weight lifting, and wres- 
tling. The organization has sixty-five regional 
associations throughout the U.S.; its headquar- 
ters are in New York City.

AMAZON (Fori and Span. Rto Amazonas)^ 
river ot South America, largely in Brazil, ranked 
as the largest m the world m terms of watershed 
area, numtief at tributaries, and volume of water 
discharged Measuring alK>ul 1900 mi. from 
source to maulh. it is siH'cmd m length only to 
the Nile among the overs of the world, With its 
hundreds of tribuiaries, the Amazon drains a 
territory of more than 2,100,000 sq.mi., roughly 
half of which Is in Brazil; the rest is in Peru, 
Icuador, Bcdivia, and Ventzyela, It is estimated 
that the Amazon disc barges between 9,000,000 
ancJ 12,000,000 gal of water per sec., and depos- 
its a daily average of i,000,C300 tons of sediment 
near its mouth. The annual outflow from the 
river accounts for one fifth of all the fresh water 
which drams into the oceans of the world. The 
ouipoyring of water and sediment is so vast that 
the saltnily and color of the Atlantic Ocean are 
altered for a distance of 200 mi. from the mouth 
of the river. 

The major headstreams of the Amazon are the 
Ucayali and Marahdn rivers, both of which rise 
in the permanent snows and glaciers of the high 
Andes Mts. and follow parallel ccHtrses north- 
ward before fining near Nauia, Peru. From this 
confluence the main trunk of the Amazon flows 
in a generally eastward direction to the Atlantic 
O^tan. The Amazon enters the Atlantic through 


452 



AMAZONS 


a broad estuary, roughly estimated at 150 mi. in 
width. Here, delta deposits have formed a maze 
of islands that separate the river into branches 
The mouth of the mam stream is 50 mi. wide. 
This branch, known as the Par^, is separated 
from a smaller branch by Marajd Island, which 
has an area of more than 14,000 sq.mi. During 
new and full moon a tidal bore (see Bore), or 
wave front from the ocean, sweeps more than 
400 mt upstream at speeds in excess of 40 
m p h This phenomenon often causes waves up 
to 16 ft. in height. 

The Amazon watershed includes the largest 
and wettest tropical plain m the world. Heavy 
rams drench much of the densely forested 
lowland region throughout the year but espe- 
cially between January and June. Seasonal varia- 
tion m rainfall is reflected by the width, rate of 
flow, and discharge volume of the river. During 
the months of maximum precipitation, broad 
areas traversed by the Amazon are subject to 
severe floods. In Brazil the width of the river 
ranges between 1 and 6 mi. at low stage but 
expands to 30 mi. or more during the annual 
floods; the rate of flow ranges between 1.5 and 
5 m.p.h.; and the crest of the water at flood time 
often rises 50 ft. above the norm. To dram the 
vast mass of water, the Amazon has carved a 
deep bed in the plain through which it flows. In 
one sector near Obidos, Brazil, the bed of the 
river is more than 300 ft. below the average 
surface level of its water. 

Because of its vastness, annual floods, and 
navigability, the Amazon is often called the 
'"Ocean River" The total number of its tributar- 
ies is as yet uncounted, but there are more than 
200 in Brazil alone. Seventeen of the largest 
known tributaries are more than 1000 mi. ii^ 
length. The Amazon proper is navigable ti 
ocean liners of virtually any tonnage for tW 
thirds of its course. Transatlantic ships # 
regularly at Manaus, nearly 1000 mi. upstr^; 
and ships of 3000 tons can reach Iquitos, 

2300 mi. from the river's mouth, the fa^^^ 
point from sea of any port serving ocean / 

River steamers of more modest tonnai^^^ 
navigate on more than one hundred 


larger tributaries. 

The delta region of the Amazon £ 
been discovered by Vincente 
(q.v.) in 1500, but exploration did# ^^8*^ 
until 1540-41, when an expedition \Py 
cisco de Orellana (q.v.) started do^^® Hapo 
R, in what Is now Ecuador, and#^^®^ 
Atlantic Ocean. Pedro Teixetra 
first upstream voyage. Between 
and August, 1638, he ascended ambfii 


the source of the Napo R. and crossed the 
Andes to Quito, Ecuador Later, he returned by 
the same route In modern times the river has 
been explored by many scientific expeditions, 
including that led (1914) by Theodore Roosevelt 
(qv.) and others sponsored by the National 
Geographic Society (q v.) and the government 
of Brazil 

Some authorities believe that the river was 
named after the Amazons (q v.), women warri- 
ors of Greek mythology who were thought to 
reside in the region; other scholars insist that 
the name is derived from the Indian word 
amassonsi ("boat destroyer") 

Despite centuries of effort to overcome the 
dominance of nature, man has made little im- 
pact on the Amazon and most of its vast 
draina^ basin No bridge spans the river Ex- 
cept near its mouth, the Amazon watershed 
constitutes' one of the most thinly populated 
regions in the world Much of the territory 
drained by the river system has never been 
thoroughly explored One may fly for hours over 
the tropical forests that cover much of the 
rive'^s floodplain and see no sign of human 
secernent. In many stream valleys, Indian tribes 
hdtile to strangers continue to live much as 
tley did before the arrival of the Europeans. 
AOst commerce Is narrowly conlined to the 
^vigable sectors of the river The econ- 

omy continues to be dorai^ted by primitive 
^agriculture, hunting and lining, and the gather- 
ing of various fore^^oducts Commercial 
farming, tourism, m|lfng, and industry play only 
a minor role m ^ region But particularly in 
Brazil, the dream of conquering nature and de- 
veloping the seemingly enormous economic 
potential of the Amazon region is still strong, 

JP.A. 

AMAZONS, in Greek mythology, a race of 
warlike women who excluded men from their 
society The Amazons occasionally had sexual 
relations with men of neighboring states, and all 
male children born to them were either sent to 
live with their fathers or killed The girls were 
trained as archers for war, and the custom of 
burning off the right breast was practiced to fa- 
cilitate bending the bow Hence the name 
"Amazon", derived from the Greek word for 
"breastless" In art, however, in which they are 
frequently represented, they are depicted as 
beautiful women with no apparent mutilation. 
Ancient art such as that on temple friezes, vases, 
and sarcophagi usually presents them in battle 
scenes According to legend, they were almost 
constantly at war with Greece and fought other 
nations as well. According to one version, they

were allied to the Trojans and during the siege 
of Troy their queen was slain by the Greek war- 
rior Achilles (q.v.). Some scholars who attribute 
a historical foundation to the legends identify 
the kingdom of the Amazons with Scythia or 
Asia Minor on the shores of the Black Sea.

AMBATO/ city in Ecuador, and capital of 
Tungurahua Province, on the Ambaio R., 70 
miles s. of Quito. A leading commercial and 
transportation center and a mountain resort, the 
city is in a fertile region near the porthern foot 
of Mt. Chimborazo. Ambato has frequently 
been damaged by earthquakes. Called the ''Gar- 
den City of Ecuador", the city is known for the 
production of peaches, apples, grapes, pears, or- 
anges, and strawberries, Grain, sugarcane, and 
vegetables are also grown. Local industries pro- 
duce textiles, flour, canned fruit, ieathc^r goods, 
rubber, wine, and furniture. The Poet juan Mon- 
talvo (1832*-89) was born here. Nearby G«meral

AMBER (Ar. anbar, meaning "ambergris''), 
fossil resin that, in prehistoric times, exuded 
from various now-extinct coniferous trees. It is 
usually a yellow or yellow-brown color. It dev*d- 
ops in round, irregular lumps, grains, or drains; 
has a perfectly conchoidal frac^yr«^ is slightiv 
brittle, and emits an agri'eabln odor wher 
rubbed. Amber burns with a bright flame and 
pleasant smell and becomes negatively elecinr 
by friction. It was obtained in antiquity from the 
southern coast of the Baltic Sea, where it is still 
found and obtained rommerciafiy by strip miH' 
ing. It is also found in small quantitic^s in Sicily, 
Rumania, Sibf*ria, Greenland, Burma, Aystralia, 
and the United States. Ambt^r is used in Ihc* arts, 
it is also used in the manyfacture of iewelry, 
Cigarette holders and pi|>c?siems, and in the 
Imaking of varnish, 

AMBERGRIS (I r. ambn* "gray ambt^r"; Ar, 
anbar), fatty or pitchfikt* substance, black or 
gray in color, wiih yellow or red striae. It is pro- 
duced in the intestine of the sperm whale (see 
Whau: Tmihed Whaim: 5:ptmn Whak^, appar- 
ently when the animat is sick,, The horny, parrot- 
like lieak of the cylllefish |q,.v,|, the principal

seashore, in lumps of from U, oz. to 200 ib. The 
harder, more valuable, gray ambergris accumu- 
lates in the intestine of the whale, obstructing it 
and eventually causing the death of the anintal 
The softer, black variety is that which the whale 
has been able to ej-ect soon after its formation 
When fresh, ambergris has a strong, unpleasant 
smell; after exposure to the air it hardens and 
develops its characteristic odor, which is sweet 
and musty. 

At one time ambergris was used as a medici- 
nal cure-ali in the Orient and in Europe, and as 
a flavoring for fcK>d in various Asian l^mds. Its 
greatest value now is as tht» liest fixative in mak- 
ing t:ostlv perfumes; it prevents the volatile oils 
from evaporating too qyickiv. Because the de- 
mand tor ambergris far exr:eecis the uncertain 
supply, tht^ value is high. In 'ims the Swiss 
chemist leopold Uuftlka (q.v;) developed syn- 
thetic ambergris, whic:.h is far k^ss expensive 
than the -natyral substance.

AMBULANCE 


prelate and statesman, born m Chaumont-sur- 
Loire From 1493 to 1498 he was archbishop of 
Rouen When Louis Xll (q.v.), King of France, as- 
cended the throne in 1498 Amboise was ap- 
pointed cardinal and premier. As premier he be- 
came the most important figure in the political 
affairs of the country. He introduced reforms in 
the judicial system, reduced taxation, and from 
1499 to 1503 was active in military campaigns in 
northern Italy against Milan. After the death of 
Pope Alexander VI (see under Alexander) in 
1503, Amboise made unsuccessful efforts to 
gain the papacy. He served as papal legate to 
France from 1503 until his death. 

AMBRIDCE/ borough of Pennsylvania, in Bea- 
ver Co., on the Ohio R., about 16 miles nw. of 
Pittsburgh. Ambndge manufactures metal prod- 
ucts, structural steel, building supplies, and 
electrical equipment. Economy, a commune, 
was established on the site in 1825 by the Har- 
mony Society. Pop. (1970) 11,324. 

AMBROSE, Saint (340?-397), one of the most 
celebrated of the Fathers of the Church (q.v.) 
and one of the four doctors of the Western 
Christian Church, born in Trier (now in West 
Germany), and educated in Rome, Italy His fa- 
ther was prefect of Gaul, Ambrose studied law, 
entered the civil service, and in about 370 was 
appointed a consular magistrate in Upper Italy, 
with hfs headquarters at Milan In this office his 
kindness and wisdom won for him the esteem 
and love of the people, who called for him to be 
bishop of Milan in 374. Although he refused to 
accept this position and even left the city to 
avoid It, he finally turned to Milan and allowed 
himself to be baptized. As bishop, Ambrose de- 
fended the churches of Milan against the intro- 
duction of Arian doctrines (see Arius) and 
brought Theodosius ! (q.v.), Emperor of Rome, 
to repentance and public penance for ordering 
the massacre of the rebellious Thessalonians 
(q.v,), Ambrose is best known as the sym- 
pathizing friend of Monica (332?-87), mother of 
Saint Augustine (q.v,), and as the one who re- 
ceived Augustine into the Church. He is the pa- 
tron saint of Milan, and the Ambrosian Library 
(q.v.) in that city was named in his honor. 
Among his writings are a number of exegetical 
treatises and a manual of Christian morality. He 
also composed many hymns, several of which 
are extant. His feast day is Dec. 7. 

AMBROSIA, In classical mythology, food 
eaten by Greek and Roman gods, thought to im- 
part immortality. Sometimes ambrosia was 
mixed with nectar (q.v.) and taken as a drink. 
The deities also used ambrosia as an ointment 
or perfume. When the gods allowed ambrosia 


to be given to a mortal, the taster acquired spe- 
cial divine qualities Today, the term is com- 
monly used to mean any fragrant or delicious- 
tasting substance. See Greek Religion and 
Mythology; Roman Religion and Mythology. 
AMBROSIAN LIBRARY^ famous library in 
Milan, Italy, named after Saint Ambrose (qv), 
patron saint of the city The library was founded 
in 1609 by Count Fedengo Borromeo (1564- 
1631), Archbishop of Milan It contains over 
500,000 printed volumes, 35,000 manuscripts, 
and 2100 incunabula Among the manuscripts 
are a Greek Pentateuch (qv) dating from the 
5th century ad; several palimpsest texts of clas- 
sic authors, fragments of the translation of the 
Bible into the Gothic language by Ulfilas (q.v.), 
Bishop of the Goths; a manuscript known as the 
Codex Atlanticus, containing notes and draw- 
ings by the Italian artist and scientist Leonardo 
da Vinci (q.v.); and a volume containing the 
writings of the ancient Roman poet Vergil, with 
marginal notations by the Italian poet Petrarch 
(qq.v.). 

AMBULANCE, vehicle designed for the trans- 
portation of the sick or injured. In addition to 
cots mounted on a resilient base to prevent jar- 
ring the patients, modern ambulances are 
equipped with blood-transfusion apparatus, 
oxygen-inhalation devices, and in some cases 
incubators for the newborn The primary pur- 
pose of the ambulance is to carry patients to a 
medical center for treatment, but ambulances 
are also used to move the convalescent from the 
hospital to the home. The two mam types of 
ambulance are the civilian and the military 
Modern civilian ambulances are built for speed 
and smooth riding. As a rule they have facilities 
for one or two patients and an attending physi- 
cian or nurse. Community hospitals, most vol- 
untary and private hospitals and clinics, and, in 
the larger urban areas, many private firms pro- 
vide ambulance service. 

Because of the rugged conditions in the field, 
military ambulances are designed for sturdiness 
rather than for speed and are equipped for 
emergency treatment of the wounded on the 
way to the collecting stations. The military am- 
bulance usually has a load capacity of six ambu- 
latory or four stretcher patients. 

Animal-drawn ambulances first were used in 
the 1850's in the Crimean War. Standardized 
horse-drawn military ambulances were intro- 
duced in the United States during the Civil War. 
The first U.S motorized ambulance unit oper- 
ated m Mexico m 1916 during the American pu- 
nitive expedition against the Mexican revolu- 
tionary general Pancho Villa (see Villa,

AMEN (Heb., "certainly" or "truly"), expres- 
sion used in worship by Jews and Christians 
and, to a lesser extent, by Muslims. When it is 
uttered at the close of a prayer it signifies "So 
be it" and expresses affirmation or belief. When 
it is said after repeating the Creed (see CRtfOsj, 
it means "So it is." 

AMEN, ancient Egyptian deity. See Amon. 
AMENDMENT. 1. In legislation, the alteration 
of an existing statute. Although the Urtiied 
States Congress has no power to alter the Con- 
stitution, it does have the power to repeal and 
alter laws. The method of amending the Consti- 
tution is provided by Article V. According to this 
article, an amendment passes after a two-thirds 
vote of both houses of Congress or after the 
petition of two thirds of the State legislatures. 
Amendments are ratified by either the legisla- 
tures of three fourths of the States or by con- 
ventions in three fourths of the States. The Con- 
stitution of the U.S. contains no provision 
directly limning the power of the State legisla- 
tures to repeal the statutes of the several Stales, 
but Arfick* I, Section 10, limits the power of a 
State legislature to repeal statutes that are m ef- 


fect (oniracts with the citi/ens of the State. 

2. In parliamentary procedure, a motion, bill, 
or resolution When adopted in accordance 
with the rules of parliamentary procedure, an 
amendment becomes a part of the original mo- 
tion or bill. 

3. In the law of pleading and practice, the 
correc ting of an error or defect in a pleading or 
judicial proceeding in the progress of an action 
(q.v.) or other proceeding.

AMERICA, second- largest isolated land mass 
of the earth, comprising the two continents of 
the Western Hemisphere. America is a common 
designation for either or both North America 
and South America, for the Western Hemi- 
sphere as a whole, and for The United States of 
America, The entire Western Hemisphere is 
often called the Americas. The word first ap- 
peared in Cosmographiae fntroductio ("Intro- 
duction to Cosmography"), edited and pub- 
lished in 1507 by the German cartographer 
Martin Waldseemuller (q.v.). The name was de- 
rived from Americus, the Latinized given name 
of the Italian navigator Amerigo Vespucci (q.v.), 
whose expeditions to the New World are de- 
scribed in the work. As used by Waldseemuller, 
America specifically designated the lands dis- 
covered by the Italian explorer Christopher Co- 
lumbus (q.v.), Vespucci, and other early explor- 
ers of the West Indies and the n.e. coast of the 
southern continent. The Flemish geographer 
Gerhardus Mercator (q.v.) first used the word to 
refer to all of the Western Hemisphere on a map 
of the world published in 153B. See Exploration, 
Geographic; North America; South America.

AMERICAN ANTI-SLAVERY SOCIETY, associa- 
tion organized in December, 1833, in Philadel- 
phia, Pa., for the purpose of advancing the abo- 
lition of slavery in the United States It was 
established by delegates from similar State and 
local societies, including the Boston, Mass., or- 
ganization, founded in January, 1832, under the 
leadership of the abolitionist William Lloyd Gar- 
rison (q.v.), and the first such society in Amer- 
ica. The three abolitionist leaders responsible 
for the establishment of the American Anti-Slav- 
ery Society were Theodore Dwight Weld 
(1803-95), Arthur Tappan (1786-1865), and Lewis 
Tappan (1788-1873). Militant in the fight against 
slavery, the organizers of the society were re- 
garded in the southern States as fanatics, mem- 
bers of the society were denounced, and meet- 
ings were broken up. In 1839, some less militant 
members broke away from the society and 
formed the Liberty Party (q.v.). The society oper- 
ated until 1870, when the adoption of the Fif-

AMERICAN ARCHITECTURE, the art and 
technique of building as developed m the 
ish colonies in North America and subsequently 
In the United States. American architecture rep- 
resents a strongly individualistic and original 
achievement, although European immigrants to 
the U5. brought with them varying styles of ar- 
chitecture. European design of the late Middle 
Ages through modern times has continued to 
influence American building. In most cases, the 
imported modes were adapted to the new envi- 
ronments and to new technological and social 
devel 'wents. Historically, AmeficMn architec- 
ture may be divided into three main periods. 
The first, the colonial period, lasted from the 
founding of fnglish settlements early in the 17th 
century to the American Revolution, which

ended in 1 78 i I he w on<T whic h may be called 
the era of expansion, from the establish- 

ment of the American republic to World War I,

When the first pf*'fmanenc settlers arrived in 
America, they loymi only the primitive architec- 
ture of the American Indians, to which they 
were unaccustomed I hey began to build in 
styles that reflected their cingms. Thus, the Eng- 
lish ccilomsti built in the Inglish manner; far to 
the Kiuthwesb m Honda, and along the Gulf 
Coast. Spanish setilers built in a Spanish form of 
the barctoo*^ <sae llA«CK|Uf}; along the Mis-

Spanish manner to the same way, in New Neth-

settlers budt m the Ouich manner; and in New 
Sweden, later Delaware, Swedish settlers, com- 
ing from a forested country, miroduced the 
Swedish log cabin, which b«:«m€ lypicai of the 
American woodland froniitr. All of these na- 
tional ttylei, which deviated somewhat from 
their original forms, entered into the American 
architectural hiw^iiage. fhit varied heritage pre- 
pared the way for the tcierticism, Ihe foomow-

AMERICAN ARCHITECTURE 


English Colonial Styles. The first colonial 
homes m the British colonies were of wattle, 
clay, and thatch, like the peasant huts of Eng- 
land Later the homes, like many rural Tudor 
houses, were built of hewn planks set up on end 
in plaster, in so-called half-timber construction. 
The more prosperous settlers began to build m 
the styles that were fashionable m England, par- 
ticularly a special version of the Italian Renais- 
sance based upon the architecture of the Italian 
artist Andrea Palladio (q v ) Some time elapsed 
before the hard conditions of pioneer life per- 
mitted similar standards of comfort and ele- 
gance in America, and early colonial building 
was rather plain. Yet stone mansions were built, 
for example, the Whitfield House, built about 
the middle of the 17th century, m Guilford, 
Conn Brick dwellings were also built, such as 
the Adam Thoroughgood House (about 1640), 
near Norfolk, Va. These two surviving represen- 
tatives of the larger American houses of the 
mid-17th century have big, picturesque chimney 
stacks rising up the gable ends. An example of a 
more modest, although relatively ample, type of 
dwelling is the Barnard-Capen House (1636) in 
Dorchester, Mass, No 17th-century house has 
survived to the present without alteration or res- 
toration, but the best restorations are probably 
close to the originals. Practically no example re- 
mains, however, of the most common type of 


building of that period, that is, the one-room 
dwelling with a single fireplace and a loft for 
sleeping, which was used by people with lim- 
ited means. Such houses were low, dark, and 
crowded Vestiges of them are incorporated In 
larger buildings erected over or around them, 
such as the Hempsted House (1678, enlarged in 
1728) in New London, Conn 

No examples of meeting houses of the period 
have survived Records indicate that they were 
small, simple, barnlike structures which rarely 
included decorative features or fine furnishings 
The Old Ship Church (1681) in Hingham, Mass., 
retains part of the original building The recently 
restored Saint Luke's church in Smithfield, Va , is 
largely of the late 17th century Constructed of 
brick, with a tower, stepped gable, and the older 
English style of Gothic tracery, it resembles a 
very small church of the same period in Eng- 
land, In Its mixture of the older Gothic and the 
new modified classical elements, it also reflects 
the changing styles, as they occurred some dec- 
ades earlier, in English building. 

When means were available, the architects of 
the period employed decorative features, such 
as ornamental plasterwork, blue and white tiles,

carved moldings, and painted decorations on 
floors, walls, and possibly on ceilings, Su<h 
decoration suited the tastes of the prosperous 
northern merchants and southern planters, who 
possessed splendid silver, upholstered furniture, 
and sumptuous clothing. 

In many regions the modes of the 17th cen- 
tury persisted into the 18th These modes over- 
lapped with the developing English Georgian 
styles imported by the more prosperous settlers. 
Great Georgian mansions were erected by the 
wealthy merchants of Boston, Mass., New York 
City, and Wiiliamsburg, Va., and by southerr^ 
plantation owners, particularly the tobacco 
planters. Built of brick or stone, these edifices 
had spacious central hallways, handsome stair* 
cases, and lofty ceilings. The rt>oms were mur«» 
numerous, better heated, and better lighted 
than those of earlier buildings. Such mansions 
reflected the elegance of the Georgian styles 
evolved in England under the influence of such 
architects as Sir Christopher Wren (q.v.) and 
lames Gibbs (1682-1754). Books illuslraiing the 
plans and ornamental details of the new build* 
ing types circulated among the wealthier and 
more cultured stone masons and carpeniers In** 
spired by such works, which reflected the influ 
ence of the baroque style then sweeping iu 
rope, colonial master builders composed 


sumptuous overmantels, doorvs/ays, staircases 
and plasterwork Homes and < hurc hes took on a 
more sophisticated air. 

More attention was given during this penod 
to gardens and the orderly layout of the 
grounds, shown m the enrichment and succes- 
sive enlargements oi Mount Vernon (q.v.), built 
m I74i the estate of President George Washing- 
ton (qv.) m Fairfax County, Va In this way a 
closer resemblance was achu»ved between the 
simple wooden American houses and the enor- 
moudy larger, portuoed, stone-built British 
mansions, with their formal landscaping.

the size of the ctties and the size and style of 
adjoining structures, these buildings did not ap- 
proach the majesty of comparable structures 
being erected in Europe. 

Non-Engiish Contributions. Meanwhile, the 
Spanish, who had been settling South America 
and Central America, had extended their mis- 
sions northward into what is now the South- 
west. Their most durable monuments were 
churches such as the 18th-century baroque 
church of San Jos6 in San Antonio, Texas, and 
similar edifices built later in California. In the 
French settlements along the Mississippi R., 
there developed a regional type of verandaed 
house with steeply sloping roofs. Of these, only 
a few remain, among them the building at 
Sainte Genevieve, Mo. In New Orleans, La., the 
French and Spanish styles were fused into a 
characteristic new style marked by wrought-iron 
balconies. In New York and New Jersey, the 
Dutch settlers had introduced their masonry 
houses with stepped gables and little porches. 
All of these varied national styles contributed to 
the development of American architecture. 

ERA OF EXPANSION 

After the American Revolution, and particularly 
after the acquisition of the Louisiana Territory, 
the nation began its expansion westward. The 
architecture of the newly formed country shared 
the sense of exuberant growth. New European 
stylistic' trends, which began to set in about 
1750, profoundly influenced American architec- 
ture for the next two hundred years. This period

federal style, it was designed by Thomas Jefferson as a 
modified replica of the Pantheon (Rome); it opened in 
1826 University of Viralnia Information Services 

IS usually referred to as the classical revival 

Among the many causes of this artistic revolu- 
tion was the emergence of a new class, which 
quickly amassed great fortunes through new in- 
dustries and acceleration of world commerce. 
Symbolic and associative values were found in 
the monuments of the past, especially those of 
classical Rome, because the early American 
statesmen felt an affinity for the Roman republi- 
can institutions. 

The new styles, however, did not remain fixed 
on Roman public buildings. Reflecting Ameri- 
can interest in all the cultures of the world, the 
new styles also drew upon the delicate orna- 
ment at Pompeii, the austere temples at Paestum 
and Athens, the exotic shapes of mosques and 
pagodas in the East, the pyramids and obelisks 
of Egypt, and the medieval cathedrals In 1785, 
the American statesman Thomas Jefferson (q v.) 
recommended an ancient Roman building, the 
Matson Carrie in Nfmes, France, to his compa- 
triots as the model for the new State Capitol to 
be built in Richmond, Va. George Washington 
concurred with him in urging that the master- 
pieces of the past be used as models for new 
buildings in the U.S 

Architects trained in Europe came to the U.S., 
including Peter Harrison; William Thornton 
(1759-1828); Pierre Charles L'Enfant, who laid 
out the plan for Washington, D.C; Benjamin

(see below), was used for major buildings Both 
styles reflected the prosperity and optimism of 
the mid-19th century Society was frankly mate- 
rialistic, the U S possessed great wealth and was 
not hesitant about displaying it m costly build- 
ings The period was an era of grand opera and 
sentimental poetry Such outspoken emotional- 
ism seems excessive to modern eyes, but it ex- 
pressed an enviable assurance 
John Ruskin (q v ) was the ideological father 
of High Victorian Gothic style This style permit- 
ted a mixture of details and motifs from every 
period of the past. The results were highly origi- 
nal Brilliant colors were favored, for example, in 
striped tile roofs, striking forms, such as thin 
towers and pointed arches, and rich detail, such 
as the carving that appeared on churches, muse- 
ums, and even factories The American master- 
pieces of that period include Memorial Hall 
(1878) of Harvard University in Cambridge, 
Mass., by William R. Ware (1794-1843) and Hen- 
ry Van Brunt (1832-1903), and the Connecticut 
State Capitol (1880) in Hartford. Many buildings, 
however, were designed m a much purer, even 
archeological Gothic style, such as St. Patrick's 


Cathedral in New York City (1858-79), by James 
Ren wick (1818-95) 

Second Empire Style (1860-90) The Second 
Empire style, derived from the France of Em- 
peror Napoleon III (qv), was used in the US 
chiefly for city halls (Boston, 1862, and Philadel- 
phia, 1880) and post offices. The masterpiece of 
this style was the State, War and Navy Building 
(1871-88), by Alfred B Muller (1834-70), now 
called the Executive Office Building, it is located 
west of the White House in Washington, DC 
Although classical m detail, the columns, pavil- 
ions, mansarded roofs, and towers of this style 
were piled up m a picturesque and intricate di- 
versity. Towers were applied to every type of 
building, from hotels to hospitals In the 1870's 
and 1880's the trend led to the building of town 
and country houses in the style of French cha- 
teaux (see The Age of Splendor, below) The 
most important architecture of the mid-century 
was done, however, in one or another of the 
Romantic revivals. 

The Romantic Revivals (1840-1900) The 
popularity of Gothic revival buildings persisted 
well into the 20th century. From Latrobe's

styles added the following to the eclecticism in 
American building a revival of American colo- 
nial architecture, particularly its Georgian phase, 
a revival in the South and West of Spanish colo- 
nial, a return to baroque grandeur in the tempo- 
rary buildings of the expositions in Chicago, Hi 
(1893), Buffalo, N Y (1901), and Saint Louis, Mo 
(1904) The gleaming white palaces erected at 
these expositions were heavily dependent on 
the architectural fashions of Pans as sponsored 
at the Ecole des Beaux-Arls, where many of the 
greatest American architects had studied The 
Beaux-Arts influence was seen in the classical, 
domed State capitols rising in nearly every State, 
in libraries and museums, m railroad terminals 
such as Grand Central Station (1913) and Penn- 
sylvania Station (1910, demolished in 1%8) in 
New York City, and the Union (1907) in Wash- 
ington, D C 

The architects of these enormous monuments 
included such famous firms as Carr^re and Has- 
tings, D H Burnham and Company, and 
McKim, Mead and White (see White, Stanford). 
Impressive town houses and resort chiteaux 
were also included m their work, such as the 
Vanderbilt mansion "Biltmore" in Asheville, 
N C, (1890), by Richard Morris Hunt (see under 
Hunt) The designs were grand and lavish, but 
often derivative In their eclecticism, these ar- 
chitects sometimes imported from Europe 
whole buildings or parts of buildings to be in- 
corporated in new structures Often, however, 
the buildings showed original creativity The 
hold of these architetts was so strong that it 
withstood, for many years, the genius of such 
innovators as the American architect Frank 
Lloyd Wright (q.v.), the demands of expanding 
American industry, and the swift growth of the 
American population Despite the advances of 
American technology, the old eclectic architec- 
ture persisted after modernism had been in the 
ascendant m Europe for some years. 

MODERN AMERICAN ARCHITECTURE 
The architecture of the U.S. in the 20th century 
grew from several 19th-century roots. One was 
the advance In building technology, so strik- 
ingly displayed in the American skyscraper. An- 
other was the development of expressive new 
idioms of form and space in the works of the 
American architects Louis Flenry Sullivan (q.v.) 
and Frank Lloyd Wright. 

Technology and the Tall Buildings 
(1830V19S0^s). The 19th century was one of 
the most technically inventive centuries in his- 
tory. It saw the application of new techniques 
and of new mechanical means In virtually every 
activity of man. The 19th century produced also 


a new technology of building, which inevitably 
affected architecture In time it became clear 
that the new, great contributions in architecture 
would come from those who grasped the possi- 
bilities of the new materials and the new tech- 
niques 

In addition to the stimulus of the new re- 
sources provided by technology was the spur of 
necessity With the population doubling m al- 
most every generation, with production growing 
at an even faster pace, builders could scarcely 
keep up with the demands upon them In the 
frenzy of new building, tradition was aban- 
doned when It stood in the way When conven- 
tional craftsmanship proved too slow, new tech- 
niques were devised Even in the 1830's, 
revolutionary methods of building with wood 
were developed to meet the demands for 
speedy construction and to overcome the short- 
age of skilled labor 

Men such as the American inventor James Bo- 
gardus (1800-74) responded to the demand by 
developing cast iron into a building material 
lighter and more adaptable than masonry Cast 
iron could be fabricated into cheap, standard- 
ized parts that could be rapidly bolted together, 
and buildings could be prefabricated and 
shipped to distant places Other innovators de- 
veloped metal trusses that made it possible to 
roof column-free interior spaces easily and 
cheaply Such roofs were used for railroad sta- 
tions, market halls, exhibition palaces, and 
domes like that of the Capitol of the US (q v ) 
m Washington, D.C 

After the American Civil War, metal frames 
were combined with other inventions, notably 
the elevator, making possible tall buildings, un- 
precedented not only for height but for ease of 
construction The decisive example was the 
Home Insurance Building, by William LeBaron 
Jenney (q v.), erected (1883-87) m Chicago The 
metal frame supported the entire building, dis- 
pensing with the ponderous masonry of former 
times. The race for height ended for the time 
being, m 1930, with the construction of the Em- 
pire State Building in New York City. This build- 
ing, measured without the 222-ft television an- 
tenna added later, was 1250 ft high, taller than 
the 1000-ft. Eiffel Tower (q.v.) in Paris, which 
was the highest structure of the 19th century In 
1968 the John Hancock Center in Chicago rose 
to a height of 1107 ft,, plus 344 ft. of television 
antennae. The World Trade Center m New York 
City, with construction still going on, rises 
higher than the Empire State Building; see Re- 
cent Trends and Achievements, below. In 1974, 
however, the tower headquarters of Sears, Roe-

were also derived organically from the materials 
and function of the building His buildings were 
not only great works as architecture, but previ- 
sions of the architecture? of the future. Among 
them were his Auditorium Hotel (1889), now 
Roosevelt University, and the Carson Pirie Scott 
Department Store (1904), both m Chicago. Sulli- 
van's exc^uisite ornament, although his own cre- 
ation, was analogous to the so called art nou- 
veau style that was beginning to sweep Europe 
Among Sullivan's other contributions are his 
books Kindergarten Chats (in serial form, 
1901-02) and The Autobiography of an Idea 
(1924), both of whK*h greatly influenced the 
new generation of architects by postulating the 
theory that form follows function. 

Frank Lloyd Wright and the Fralrie Style 
(1890's-195CI's). In Chicago, during the latter 
part of the 19th century, a school of architects, 
of whom Sullivan and Wright (Sullivan's fore- 
most pupil) were the most famous, originated a 
new American style of domestic architecture. 
Their house designs were tong, low, spreading, 
informal, and organic, exemplified by Wright's 
Robie House (1909) in Chicago. This prairie style 
became internationally known and was re-

influential design used low, sweeping lines, squat 
chimneys, sheltering overhangs, and warm~hued bricks 
to express a Midwest prairie setting Hddrich-Biwrtng 

garded as truly American, fresh, and modern 
For more than a decade Wright was virtually 
Ignored m his own country His ideas were 
taken up abroad, however, principally m Eu- 
rope The so-called international style which de- 
veloped there and which absorbed his concepts 
began to influence American architecture in the 
1920's. Later examples of Wright's creativity are 
his dramatic use of the landscape in the house 
called Falling Water (1936-37), which is cantile- 
vered over a waterfall, the )ohnson Wax admin- 
istration building (1936-39), for which he also 
designed (1950) a research tower, and the Gug- 
genheim Museum (1946-59) 

The international style was especially influ- 
enced also by the German Bauhaus school (see 
Bauhaus), founded by Walter Adolf Gropius 
(qv.), and by the abstract artists interested in 
the pure form of the Dutch de Stijl school, 
among whom was the painter Pieter Cornells 
Mondriaan (qv) Some architects of the Bau- 
haus school, notably Ludwig Mies van der Rohe 
(q V ), were also identified with de Stijl.

which tended to regard it as bare and inhuman 
But by mid-century, the style had become domi- 
nant across the country Presently, as m the 
Georgian period, it is possible to find communi- 
ties, such as the town of Columbus, Ind , in 
which all buildings, from factory and shopping 
center to homes and schools, form a harmony of 
modern architecture 

The new buildings make bold use of modern 
construction methods and structural materials 
Noteworthy among the latter are glass treated 
against glare, glass brick that admits additional 
light while preventing glare and that furnishes 
effective insulation against heat, cold, and 
noise, artificial stone; plywood and other adap- 
tations of wood and woc:)d cierivatives, gypsum, 
plastics, chiomium, aluminum, copper, and oth- 
c*r metals, and above' all, processed steel and re- 
inforced concrete By means of reinforced con- 
crete, which IS well suited to cantilever 
construction, forms freer and bolder than the 
richest Gothic have been achieved 
Recent Trends and Achievements. At first, 
modern Amc'rican architecture was wanting in 
truly monumental expression, but a certain cli- 
max had become apparent in American archi- 
tecture by the rnul 1950's, 


AMERICAN ARCHITECTURE 

Rockefeller Center in New York City has be- 
come a landmark in modern American architec- 
tural history Designed by a team of architects 
headed by Wallace Kirkman Harrison, this com- 
plex of skyscrapers has exercised increasing in- 
fluence in the years since 1931, when work on 
the center was started The significance of this 
complex, the first of its kind ever built, is that it 
represents architectural thinking on a 
multibuilding and community scale Because of 
that practical example, American architects are 
able to respond more and more creatively to 
such demands of contemporary American life as 
rapid intercommunication and integration of 
city and surrounding region An impressive re- 
sult of multibuilding planning is the World 
Trade Center in New York City, still under con- 
struction Designed by the American architect 
Minoru Yamasaki (1912- ) and the firm of Em- 
ory Roth and Sons, the center consists of two 
110-story towers, 1350 ft high (completed m 
1973), and four smaller buildings grouped 
around a plaza

omy anci the strong colonial traditions linked 
with the motherland, developed dramatically in 
the 19th century through a variety of adopted 
and adapted styles, until in scope, originality, 
power, and sheer bulk it assumed the leading 
role in world architecture after 194S.

AMERICAN FEDERATION OF LABOR, 
(A.F.L), former federation of American inter- 
national, national, and total trade unions It was 
mergfe'd with the Congress of Industrial Organi- 
zations (q.v) in December, 1955, to form the 
American Federation of Labor and Congress of 
Industrial Organizations (q.v.) The primary ob- 
lecttves of the AT L, included unionization of 
wage workers, support of legislation beneficial 
to labor, reduction of working hours, and im- 
provement of working conditions and wages. 

Although the AT.l. included a few unions or- 
ganized on a serni-incjustrial basis, such as the 
International ladies' Garment Workers' Union, 
most were craft unions; see TradI: Union, Tradi: 
Unions in the UNirro SrAfFS The overwhelming 
majority of ATM. union locals throughout the 
United States and Canada, and a number m 
Mexico and Caribbean lands, were organized in 
national and international unions. The jurisdic- 
tion cT each union was stated in the charter is- 


sued to It by the federation Local unions out- 
side the jurisdiction of the large affiliates, and 
small unions, called federal labor unions, whose 
memberships were not large enough to meet 
the charter requirements of the federation, were 
affiliated directly with the A F L. 

The A F L was a loosely organized federation 
that recognized the autonomy of the member 
craft unions National and international policies 
were determined at the A F L annual conven- 
tions and, between conventions, at the quar- 
terly meetings of the Executive Council, which 
consisted of the president, secretary-treasurer, 
and fifteen vice-presidents, all these officers 
were elected at the annual convention The na- 
tional headquarters and all the activities were fi- 
nanced by per-capita dues paid by federation 
affiliates 

The A F L was founded in Columbus, Ohio, on 
Dec 7-8, 1886, during a period of widespread

AMERICAN FEDERATION OF LABOR 


Organi/eci I racies and t abi)r Unions ol the 
Unito(i States and Canada, established in 1881 fci 
en( ourage labor U^gisiation, ar^i several unaffil 
ialed trade unions rnc*rged to form the A,Ui. 
The American labor leader Samuel Gom^^rs 
(q.v,), president of the Cigarrnakers Interna- 
tional ijnion and of the federation of Organ 
iied Trades and labor Unions, was elecNni 
president of the new federation. Under his lead- 
ership the fedi‘ratM>n ** poliry 

of supporting political caritlidales considered 
friendly to labor rcfgardlesi of party ahiliafion., 

in 1924, when Gompers died, William Green 
(q.v.), a former miner, was elected president 
Membership decreased in the 192(Ts, espiH lally 
during the years of the depression tMHween 
1929 and I9JT Ihe federation grew rapidly, 
however, during the strike wave of 1914 and as 
union organization was encouraged and pro 
tected by New Deal tegislalion, Umiio 
S uns: The Roosevelt Adrninistrsimn. 

The traditional adherenct? of the krderatkin to 
craft unionism, however, was an obsiacie to 
successful, large-scale organizafion of unorgan 
izeci workers, esptrrially in sue h basic imJystoes 
as steel, auto, rubber, petroleum, and shipfiing 
In an effort to promote the organtzaiitm of the 
workers in the* rnass-prcKlucOorr mclystries 
eight unions, irt 19JS, organized inde^Htfidenilv 
as the Congretss of Indy serial Organizations 
(CI.O.). The loss of the unions in the CJ.O was 
a serious setback to Ihe Ail,., but in the gre^at 
strike wave of and with the eipansion 

of industry and the growth of the nabonal Mmt 
force during World War If, the fedeiaticin 
gained several million new memliers, and the 
return of the Internaiional ladies^ Carmeni

AMERICAN INDIAN LANGUAGES 


the different languages have been published 
The Indian-speakmg population of the United 
States IS presently quite small, those speaking 
Navaho form the largest group On the other 
hand, several million Indians live in Mexico, 
Guatemala, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Brazil, and 
Paraguay, speaking their native languages 
CLASSIFICATION OF LANGUAGES 
Indian languages may be divided into three 
broad categories according to area* Alaska, Can- 
ada, and the U S , Mexico and Central America, 
and the West Indies and South America 
Northern Groups. The Eskimo and Aleut lan- 
guages constitute the northernmost group The 
Athapaskan languages are spoken mainly in 
northern Canada but also among the Navaho 
and Apache (jf Arizona and New Mexico and 
among some small groups on the north Pacific 
coast The Algonquian languages are spoken 
print ipally by tribes in the eastern U S and Can- 
ada, but also by such Great Plains tribes as the 
Cheyenne, Arapaho, Blackfoot, and Gros Ventre 
Ihe Iroquotan group, including the Cherokee 
language, is f>rt‘valent in the eastern States The 
Muskhogean group, in the southeastern States, 
includes such languages as Choctaw, Chicka- 
saw, Crc'ek, and Seminole The Caddoan of the 
southern Plains comprises the Caddo, Wichita, 
Pawnee, and Ankara tongues 1 he Siouan lan- 
guages are spoken mainly in the midwestern 
and eastern U S , the Salishan, in the northwest- 
ern Statens and British Columbia. The Uto-Az- 
tecan languages are spoken largely in Mexico 
but also by the Ule, Comanche, Kiowa, Pima, 
Papago, Etopi, and others of the western U S 
Central Groups, in Mexico and Central Amer- 
ica the most important languages are the Uto- 
Aztecan including Aztec and the tongues spo- 
kem by some tribes m the western mountains, 
sue h as the Tarahumara and the Yaqui; the Maya, 
Quichc*», and Huastec groups, spoken mainly m 
Yucatan and Guatemala, the Otomi and Maza- 
tec groups of central Mexico, the Zapotec and 
Mixtec of southern Mexico; the Mixe and 
ioque of southcjrn Mexico; and the Totonac of 
eastern and Ihe farascan of western Mexico 
Southern Groups. The principal Indian lan- 
guages of South America arc» the Arawak and 
Carib, which are spoken by tribes who live m 
tropical forests These languages were spoken 
also in the West Indies at the time of Columbus, 
the Ge languages of eastern Brazil; the Tupi- 
Cuarani of the eastern part of the continent, the 
Guaycyru and Mataco of the south-central sec- 
tion; the^ pyelche and Tehuekhe of the far 
south; the Araucanian of Chile; the Quechua 
(Inca) and Aymara of Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador; 


and the Chibcha group prevalent throughout 
Colombia and extending into Panama and Costa 
Rica 

The classification of American Indian lan- 
guages into families of common descent is diffi- 
cult and controversial, primarily because of ig- 
norance concerning them, especially those of 
South America Indian languages were formerly 
grouped in some 150 families, comprising 55 m 
the U S and Canada, and, according to different 
authorities, 24 to 30 in Mexico and Central 
America, and 57 to 84 in South America Exclud- 
ing New Guinea and the Sudan, only about 25 
recognized language families exist in the whole 
of the Eastern Hemisphere Recent studies have 
greatly reduced, and future studies should fur- 
ther reduce, the number of American Indian 
linguistic families The use of glottochronology 
(classifying languages and estimating when the 
various languages diverged from a common an- 
cestral tongue) and other comparative tech- 
niques continues to show the interrelatedness 
and common ties many languages once pos- 
sessed 

Sinriilanties. On the basis of structure, ail In- 
dian languages spoken north of Mexico have 
been grouped into six great superfamilies, or 
phyla Although complete verification based on 
resemblances in words and phonetics is still 
lacking, studies made in the 1940's and 1950's 
have tended to confirm this classification, 
which IS generally accepted as a working hy- 
pothesis 

Five of these superfamilies are the following. 
Eskimo-Aleut, Na-Dene, including Athapaskan, 
TIingit, and Haida, Algonquian-Mosan, includ- 
ing the Algonquian languages and some spoken 
near the Pacific Coast, such as the Salish lan- 
guages, Penutian, including many languages 
spoken on or near the Pacific Coast and some 
spoken in Mexico, and Hokan-Siouan, a very 
large group, including many languages of Cali- 
fornia and the languages of the former Siouan, 
iroquoian, Muskhogean, Caddoan, and Yuman 
families, as well as some spoken in Mexico and 
Central America The Hokan-Siouan group may 
even extend into South America 

The sixth superfamily m the original classifica- 
tion IS the Uto-Aztecan Most modern authori- 
ties place Uto-Aztecan with Penutian in a 
Macro-Penutian phylum thaT also includes the 
Mayan languages and Totonac, as well as Mtxe- 
Zoque The latter languages are spoken in Mex- 
ico, and it is possible that all the languages of 
Mexico and Central America as far south as the 
Costa Rican border fall into Macro-Penutian, 
Hokan-Siouan, or the other great Mexican phy-

called Tarasco, remains an isolated language not 
yet classified within any ot the American 
linguistic groups. 

The South American situation is radKally dit

this region have been i)aseci on a comparison ot
