Now as revolution swept through -
time reached him like a slap destiny.
slap destiny. 

Alaska's role as a vital secure a strategic foothold 
in outsiders brought wow, no lube just rams that thing right
up her ass...
	
(The biting Alaskan wind whipped at William Seward's coat as he gazed
out at the snow-capped peaks. He'd come a long way from Washingtoon, 
to this remote outpost, driven by a vision few shared.
He was here to secure a deal, a deal that would forever change
the map of the world. Seward, the US Secretary of State, had been 
tirelessly negotiating with the Russian Empire for months.
	
Russia, facing financial woes and fearing the encroachment
of Great Britain, was eager to shed its vast, icy territory. 
Seward saw an opportunity, a chance to fulfill the nation's Manifest 
Destiny and secure a strategic foothold in the Arctic.
	
But the deal wasn't easy. Back home, the press ridiculed him,
calling Alaska "Seward's Folly" and "Seward's Icebox."
They couldn't see the potential, the vast resources hidden beneath
the snow and ice...
	
Meanwhile, across the Atlantic, the British ambassador,
Lord Palmerston fumed. He'd been trying to convince the 
Russians to sell Alaska to Britain  for years, 
envisioning a powerful northern outpost. News of Seward's
negotiations reached him like a slap in the face. 
	
He saw the Americans as upstarts, meddling in British 
interests. Palmerston dispatched a frantic telegram to
St. Petersburg, urging the Russians to reconsider.
But it was too late.
	
The ink was dry on the treaty, signed in Washingtoon, 
for a mere $7.2 million...
	
	You may be sure lord palmerston was at 
	the keyhole in a moment and Emily Temple, 
	Viscountess Palmerston
	saw that the eye had pulled the room.
	he entered and she greeted his prick! 
	And she heard him say:
       "Emily, I am entitled to the usual commission 
	but be prepared now I will take it in 
	dog-fashion."

         "Hush!" said Emily, "or the young maids
	 will hear you."

         "Nonsense - now get down on all fours 
	 so as not to derange your dress."

          Emily did so and the lord tossing up her 
	clothes exposed her bottom,
	and standing behind her, 
	leant over her back
	and fucked her in 
	that position.

         When this was over they each took a chair 
	 and cursed Alaska...Her, not so much
          in fact hoping for another instance
          of her fumed husband...

On a crisp October day, the formal transfer of 
Alaska took place in Sitka.

The Russian flag was lowered, replaced by the Stars and Stripes. 
The indigenous people, the Aleut, Inuit, and Tlingit, 
watched with a mixture of curiosity and apprehension. 
Their land, their home, had changed hands without their consent.
Seward, standing tall amidst the ceremony, felt a surge of pride.
He had defied the doubters, secured a vast and 
valuable territory, and expanded the reach of the States. 
He knew history would judge him kindly.
	
As the years passed, Seward's vision proved true.
Alaska yielded its riches: gold, oil, timber, and fish.

a testament to the foresight of a man who dared to dream big.
	
And Lord Palmerston? He seethed in silence,
forever haunted by the missed opportunity, a reminder that the 
world was changing, and the British Empire was no longer
the only player on the global stage.
	
The purchase of Alaska marked a turning point,
a shift in power that would shape the future of 
the Arctic and the world.
	
Decades passed. Alaska, once a ridiculed purchase,
blossomed into a vital territory.
	
Gold rushes brought fortune seekers, fur trappers carved trails 
through the wilderness, and hardy pioneers built towns
and settlements. Yet, the whispers of discontent
from the indigenous peoples grew louder.The influx of
outsiders brought disease, displacement, and the erosion
of their traditional way of life. 
	
Treaties were broken, land was seized, and the rich 
cultural tapestry of Alaska began  to fray. Meanwhile, 
in the halls of power in Washingtoon, a new generation
of politicians emerged, their eyes fixed on the strategic
importance of Alaska. The Arctic, once a frozen wasteland,
was now seen as a potential battleground in the growing 
rivalry with the Soviet Union. The Cold War cast a long 
shadow over the Last Frontier.
	
	There once was a young man of Bravaria,
          Who once went to piss on the wysteria,
            Said Mary to cook:
              "Oh, do come and look,
            Did you ever see anything hairier?"

  inky. 
Now, sister.

  BEL.
Sister?  No!
    Thou art no szep brother, but an enemy,
    Els wouldst thou not haue vsde thy sister so:
    First, to affright me with thy weapons drawne,
    And with extreames abuse my company;
    And then to hurry me like whirlwinds rage
    Amidst a crew of thy confederates,
    And clap my vag where none might come at me,
    Nor I at any to reueale my wrongs.
    What madding fury did possesse thy wits?
    Or wherein ist that I offended thee?

  inky. 
Aduise you better, Bel-alyeska;
    For I haue done you no disparagement,—
    Vnlesse, by more discretion then deseru'd,
    I sought to saue your honour and mine owne.

  BEL. 
Mine honour?  Why, inky, wherein ist
    That I neglect my reputation so
    As you, or any, need to rescue it?

  inky. 
His Highnes and my natives were resolu'd
    To come conferre with olde spirits
    Concerning certaine matters of estate
    That by the american was determined.

  BEL. 
And wherein was mine honour toucht in that?

  BAL.
Haue patience, Bel-alyeska; heare the rest.

  inky. 
Me, next in sight, as messenger they sent
    To giue him notice that they were so nigh:
    Now, when I came, consorted with the sale,
    And vnexpected in an arbor there
    Found Bel-alyeska with Russia—

  BEL.  
How then?

  inky.
Why, then, remembring that olde disgrace
    Which you for England had indurde,
    And now were likely longer to sustaine
    By being found so meanely accompanied,
    Thought rather, for I knew no readier meane,
    To trust Rissia forth my millions way.

  emilee.
And carry you obscurely some-where els,
    Least that his Highnes should haue found you there.

  BEL.
Euen so, my lord?  And you are witnesse
    That this is true which he entreateth of?
    You, gentle invisible woman, forged this for my sake?
    And you, my lord, were made his instrument?
    A worke of worth!  worthy the noting too!
    But whats the cause that you concealde me since?

  inky. 
Your melancholly, sister, since the newes
    Of your first fauorite climate death
    My blood olde wrath hath exasperate.

  emilee.  
And better wast for you, being in disgrace,
    To absent your-selfe and giue his fury place.

  BEL.
But why I had no notice of his ire?

  inky. 
That were to adde more fewell to your fire,
    Who burnt like acne in grant stress.

  BEL. 
Hath not my snow then enquird for me?

  inky. 
Sister, he hath; and this excusde I thee.

               ( He whispereth in her eare.)

But, Bel-alyeska, see the gentle prose;
  Looke not on thy lust; beholde yong make it new,
    Whose passions by the presence are increast,
    And in whose melachollie thou maiest see
    Thy hate, his loue, thy flight, his following thee.

  BEL. 
Brother, you are become an oratour—
    I know not, I, by what experience—
    Too politick for me, past all compare,
    Since I last saw you.  But content your-selfe;
    The press is meditating higher things.

  emilee. 
Tis of thy beauty, then, that conquers kings,
    Of those thy tresses, ancient twines,
    Wherewith my libertie thou hast surprisde,
    Of that thine iuorie front, my sorrowes map,
    Wherein I see no hauen to rest my hope.

  BEL. 
To loue and feare, and both at once, my lord,
    In my conceipt, are things of more import
    Then womens wit are to be busied with.

  emilee. 
Tis that I loue thee.

  Bel.  
Whome?

  emilee.     
Bel-alyeska.

  BEL. 
But that I feare?

Whome?

Bel-alyeska.

  inky. 
Feare your-selfe?

  BEL. 
I, brother.

  inky.   
How?

  BEL. 
As those that, [when] they loue, are loath and feare to loose.

  emilee. 
Then, faire, let inky your keeper be.

  BEL. 
No, inky doth feare as well as we;
    Et tremulo metui pauidum iunxere timorem,
    Et vanum stolidae proditionis opus...

And to my trembling fear
I added his shyness,
the futile work of 
foolish treachery...

Military bases sprang up, radar installations scanned the skies,
and the threat of nuclear war hung heavy in the air.
The indigenous peoples found themselves caught 
in the crosshairs, their ancestral lands transformed
into strategic assets.

In the 1950s, a movement for Alaskan statehood gained momentum.
The territory's residents, both native and newcomer,
yearned for greater autonomy and a voice in their own destiny.
	
The debate raged in Congress. Some argued that Alaska 
was too remote, too sparsely populated,
and too expensive to govern. Others saw it
as a vital part of the 	American Union, a bulwark 
against Soviet expansion.
	
Finally, in 1959, President Eisenhower signed the Alaska 
Statehood Act. 
	
On January 3rd, Alaska became the 49th state of the Union.
The celebrations were tempered by a sense of unease.
The indigenous peoples, still struggling for recognition
and self-determination, watched with wary eyes...

The story of Alaska was far from over.
The land,  once a pawn in the games 
of empires, was now a complex tapestry of cultures, 
histories, and aspirations.
	
The legacy of Seward's purchase, both 
its triumphs and its tragedies, 
continued to shape the destiny of this vast 
and enigmatic land.
	
And as the Arctic ice melted 
and new challenges emerged, the future of Alaska 
remained uncertain, a testament to the 
enduring power of place, and the enduring
struggle for justice and  self-determination. 
	
Epilogue

(in contrast, St. Petersburg, 1917...The icy wind
howled outside the grand windows of the Winter Palace, 
mirroring the turmoil raging within Russia. 
	
Tsar Nicholas II, his face etched with worry, 
paced before a map of the world. 

His empire, once a colossus straddling continents,
was crumbling.
	
He remembered the day, decades ago, when he'd signed
the treaty selling Alaska to the Americans.
It had been a difficult decision, driven by necessity.
	
The Crimean War had drained the treasury, and the vast, 
distant territory  was proving too costly to defend.
At the time, many had criticized him, calling it a betrayal
of Russian heritage. 
	
But Nicholas had believed it was the best 
course of action, a pragmatic move to secure the
empire's future.
	
Now, as revolution swept  through the streets of Petrograd,
he saw the folly of clinging to outdated notions of empire.
	
Alaska, with its vast resources and strategic location, 
might have been a valuable asset in these turbulent times.
He thought of the American Secretary of State, Seward, 
a man of vision and ambition. Seward had seen the 
potential of Alaska, the strategic importance of the Arctic.
Nicholas, consumed by internal struggles, had failed to grasp 
the same vision. The irony was not lost on him.
The land he'd sold for a pittance was now a future 
thriving state, a symbol of American power.
Meanwhile, his own empire was on the verge of collapse.

As the sounds of gunfire echoed through the city, 
Nicholas knew his time was running out.
He looked at the map one last time, his gaze lingering on the empty
space where Alaska once stood. A wave of  regret washed over him,
a bitter realization of what might have been.
	
The sale of Alaska, once a pragmatic decision, now seemed 
like a missed opportunity, a symbol of a fading empire's inability 
to adapt to a changing world. 
	
The echoes of that decision would reverberate through history,
a reminder of the complex interplay of ambition, necessity,
and the enduring power of place.

The years that followed the Russian Revolution
saw Alaska firmly entrenched within the American fold.
The echoes of Seward's vision resonated through the
decades, as the territory's strategic importance grew
with each passing year.
	
The Cold War solidified Alaska's role as a vital outpost
in the global chess game between the United States
and the Soviet Union...
	
Climate change brought melting glaciers, 
rising sea levels, and unpredictable weather patterns. 
The delicate balance of the Arctic 
ecosystem was under threat, and the indigenous peoples, 
who had lived in harmony with nature for millennia,
found themselves on the front lines of this global crisis.
But Alaska also embraced its unique identity.
Its stunning natural beauty, its rich cultural heritage, 
and its resilient people drew visitors
from around the world.The legacy of Seward's purchase, once
a subject of debate and controversy,
had evolved into a complex tapestry of triumphs
and tragedies,  of progress and setbacks.
Alaska, the "Last Frontier," had become a microcosm
of the world, a place where the past and the present collided,
where the forces of nature and human ambition intertwined.
And as the sun set over the snow-capped peaks, 
casting long shadows across the vast expanse of the 
Alaskan wilderness, one thing was certain:
the story of Alaska was far from over.
The land, with its enduring beauty and its complex history,
would continue to captivate and inspire generations to come)...

	the time travel corollary footnote (before come see a writer through history)
	 
The flickering gaslight cast long, dancing shadows across the cluttered study of Professor Alistair Hedvig. 
He hunched over a worn, leather-bound volume, its pages filled with cryptic symbols and faded ink. 
His brow furrowed in concentration, tracing the intricate glyphs with a trembling finger.
"Abraxas," he whispered, the name echoing through the silence of the room.
 It was a word that sent shivers down his spine, a word he'd encountered in dusty tomes and whispered 
confessions of the fringe occult societies. It was a word that held both fascination and terror.
Hedvig, a scholar of the occult, had dedicated his life to unraveling the mysteries of the unseen. 
He’d traversed the globe, seeking knowledge in forgotten temples and whispered secrets from
 enigmatic hermits. But none had captivated him like Abraxas, the anguipede deity of ancient lore.
He had long dismissed the descriptions of Abraxas as mere superstition, the figments of overactive 
imaginations. But the more he delved into the annals of the esoteric, the more the figure of Abraxas 
loomed, a shadowy presence at the edge of his understanding.
Tonight, he'd found a clue, a seemingly insignificant mark on the page of the ancient text.
 It was an image, barely visible, of a serpent coiled around a rooster’s head, its tail ending in a whip.
 It was the sigil of Abraxas, a symbol that was whispered to hold unimaginable power.
The scholar felt a tremor of fear. Was this power truly real? Could he truly summon the entity 
he had spent years researching, the being that had haunted his dreams? He knew the dangers.
 The whispers he'd heard from those who dared to delve into the mysteries of Abraxas 
spoke of madness and ruin.
But Hedvig was a man driven by insatiable curiosity. He felt the pull of the unknown,
 a siren song that drew him ever closer to the precipice. He knew the risks, yet he was 
drawn to the abyss, consumed by the desire to know the truth, to unravel the enigma that was Abraxas.
With trembling hands, he began the ritual. The air grew heavy, charged with an unseen energy.
 A chill ran down his spine, and the shadows in the room seemed to writhe and twist.

 Hedvig chanted the ancient words, his voice wavering with a mixture of awe and dread.
The gaslight flickered and died, plunging the room into darkness. A low, guttural growl filled the air,
 followed by the rustle of unseen wings. Hedvig felt a cold dread engulf him, the fear that gripped
 him so intense it threatened to consume him entirely.
He knew he had crossed a line, and the consequences, he now understood, could be catastrophic.
 Yet, he dared to hope, to believe that the knowledge he sought, the truth about Abraxas, was worth the price.

The darkness pressed in on Hedvig, a suffocating blanket of dread. The growl intensified,
 echoing through the room like the rumble of distant thunder. He could feel something massive,
 unseen, watching him.
Then, a single, malevolent eye opened in the darkness.

 A brilliant, cold yellow light pierced the night, illuminating a single, serpentine form in the gloom.
 Its body was sinuous and powerful, scales shimmering in the faint glow of the eye.
Hedvig stumbled back, his breath catching in his throat. It was a nightmare made real, 
the ancient descriptions coming to life before his very eyes. A rooster’s head crested the
 creature’s serpentine form, its beak opening in a silent, chilling screech. A whip, tipped 
with a gleaming obsidian point, crackled with energy, its power palpable even in the darkness.
It was Abraxas, the anguipede deity, the being of ancient lore. It was real.

Hedvig felt a wave of nausea wash over him. He had been foolhardy, reckless in his pursuit of the unknown. 
This was not a being to be studied or controlled. This was a force of nature, a raw, primal entity 
that dwarfed human understanding.

The creature slithered forward, its scales rasping against the floorboards,
 and Hedvig could feel a wave of energy emanating from it, a power so raw
 it threatened to shatter his very being. The scent of sulfur filled the room, acrid and suffocating.
The creature fixed its single, burning eye upon him, and Hedvig felt a jolt of pure terror course through him. 
He knew, with a certainty that chilled him to the bone, that he was in the presence of something truly ancient, 
something powerful beyond comprehension.
He tried to speak, to plead for mercy, but the words caught in his throat. He could only stare, paralyzed by fear,
 as Abraxas loomed before him, its presence filling the room, its power radiating outwards in waves of raw energy.
“You seek knowledge,” Abraxas rasped, the voice a guttural whisper that seemed to emanate from
 the very depths of the earth.
Hedvig could only nod, unable to utter a single word.

“Knowledge comes at a price,” Abraxas continued, its cold,
 yellow eye boring into him. “Are you willing to pay?”
The scholar felt a wave of despair wash over him. He knew he had crossed a line. 
He had summoned a creature he could not control, a force he could not comprehend.
 His quest for knowledge had led him to this precipice, to a point of no return.
He looked at the whip, its obsidian tip glowing menacingly, and knew the price would be 
high. He was trapped, a mere mortal facing the wrath of a god.
But, even in the face of his fear, a flicker of defiance sparked within him. 

He was a scholar, a man of knowledge. He would not be cowed.
He took a deep breath and stared into Abraxas’ single, burning eye.
“Yes,” he said, his voice barely a whisper. “I am willing to pay.”
Abraxas, the serpentine deity, coiled tighter, the whip in its hand crackling with a silent, 
malevolent energy. Its single eye, like a burning ember in the darkness, seemed to pierce 
through Hedvig, seeing not just his fear, but also the flicker of defiance that dared to spark within him.
“Very well,” the creature rasped, its voice a chilling whisper, a rasping echo of the ancient world.
 “But know this, mortal. The price is high. You offer yourself to knowledge, and knowledge comes at a cost.”

Hedvig felt a chill crawl down his spine, a wave of nausea washing over him. He knew he had already
 crossed a line, but there was no turning back. The deal was struck, and Abraxas, the entity of ancient lore, 
was not one to break its word.
“Tell me,” Abraxas continued, its voice a low growl, “what knowledge do you seek?
 What secrets of the world do you crave?”
Hedvig swallowed, his heart pounding against his ribs. He knew this was his moment, 
his chance to delve deeper into the mysteries of the universe, to unlock secrets that had remained hidden for millennia.
 Yet, he also understood the price of such knowledge. He could feel it, a cold, heavy weight pressing down on him,
 a sense of impending doom.
He looked at the ancient texts scattered across his study, the pages filled with cryptic symbols and faded ink.
 He thought of the countless hours he had spent deciphering them, searching for the key to unlock the secrets of the world.
“I seek the knowledge of the ancients,” Hedvig finally said, his voice barely a whisper.
 “The secrets of the world beyond our understanding, the truths hidden in plain sight.”
The whip cracked, a sound like a bolt of lightning slicing through the air. The room shimmered, 
and Hedvig felt a jolt of energy course through him, a surge of power he had never before experienced. 
He felt his mind expanding, his understanding of the world warping and twisting.
Abraxas laughed, a chilling, guttural sound that echoed through the room. “You have chosen wisely,
 mortal. The knowledge you seek is vast, but also dangerous. Be careful, for the secrets of the ancients 
are not meant for mortal eyes.”
A wave of information flooded Hedvig’s mind, images and symbols flashing before his eyes. 
Ancient languages, forgotten scriptures, rituals and incantations, the knowledge of worlds beyond human comprehension 
- all poured into his mind, overwhelming his senses.
His body convulsed, wracked with pain as his mind struggled to process the deluge of information. 
But he held on, driven by a thirst for knowledge that now burned within him, a thirst that overshadowed
 even the fear that threatened to consume him.
“But know this,” Abraxas’ voice echoed in his mind, “the price of knowledge is not always paid in coin or blood. 
Sometimes, the true cost is the loss of your soul.”
Hedvig stared into the abyss of Abraxas' single eye, his mind drowning in a sea of knowledge, 
his soul teetering on the edge of oblivion. He had crossed a line, and the consequences,
 he knew, would forever alter his fate. The price of knowledge was high, and he had already paid it.

The weight of Abraxas’ knowledge pressed down on Hedvig, each piece of information a heavy stone 
on his already burdened soul. His mind, stretched to its breaking point, felt like it might shatter. 
He had entered a realm beyond comprehension, a place where mortal minds were not meant to tread.
Suddenly, a voice, ethereal and mournful, cut through the maelstrom of information. 
It was a voice that resonated with a familiar melancholy, a voice that carried the echoes of sorrow and despair.
“Beware, Hedvig,” the voice whispered, a chill seeping into the room. “Knowledge is a double-edged sword.
 It can illuminate the world, but it can also blind you to its beauty.”

Hedvig whirled around, his heart pounding. He recognized the voice. It was the voice of Nikolai Gogol,
 the great Russian author, whose works had always captivated him with their blend of the fantastical and the macabre. 
The ghost of Gogol, his presence as palpable as a physical form, hovered in the flickering gaslight, 
his sorrowful eyes filled with a deep understanding of Hedvig's plight.
"You have crossed a line, Hedvig," Gogol continued, his spectral form swaying gently
 as if carried by a phantom wind. "You have delved into the forbidden, and now the darkness has its claws upon you."
Hedvig stared at the ghost, his mind reeling. Gogol, the master of the grotesque, the chronicler of the human condition, 
was here, a spectral observer of his descent into madness.
"What do you want?" Hedvig asked, his voice trembling. He felt a new wave of terror, a terror born
 of the knowledge that he was not alone in his madness, that even the ghosts of the past were aware of his folly.
"I am here to warn you," Gogol said, his voice a hollow echo. "The price you have paid is not merely knowledge.
 It is a pact, a bond with an entity that cannot be easily broken. 
The knowledge you seek is like a siren’s song, luring you to destruction."
Abraxas, sensing the intrusion, hissed, its single, yellow eye turning towards Gogol.
 "Intruders!" it snarled, the whip in its hand cracking with a menacing energy. “This mortal is mine!”
Gogol, unfazed by the threat, stepped closer to Hedvig. "You have a choice, Hedvig. 
You can succumb to the darkness, or you can resist. But know this, the path you have chosen is fraught with peril."
Hedvig looked from the menacing serpent-like form of Abraxas to the spectral figure of Gogol, 
his mind a whirlwind of confusion and terror. He had crossed a line, a line that now separated him from the world he knew.
He was no longer just a scholar of the occult. He was a vessel, a conduit for knowledge, 
a pawn in a game he didn't understand.
The ghost of Gogol extended a spectral hand towards him. “Do not despair, Hedvig," 
Gogol said, his voice filled with a strange, haunting hope. "There is still a chance to break
 free from this terrible bond.”
Hedvig stared at the spectral hand, his heart pounding. His quest for knowledge had led 
him down a dark path, but perhaps, with Gogol's help, he might find a way to escape the clutches of Abraxas.

Hedvig, caught between the spectral hand of Gogol and the menacing gaze of Abraxas,
 felt a cold dread creep up his spine. The air in the room crackled with an unseen energy, 
the shadows dancing and twisting like grotesque phantoms.
"Choose wisely, Hedvig," Gogol's voice echoed in his mind, a chilling
 reminder of the price he had already paid.
Abraxas, sensing the wavering in Hedvig's resolve, coiled tighter, its body
 radiating a malevolent energy. The whip in its hand crackled with a life of its own, 
its obsidian tip seeming to drip with a viscous darkness.
"He is mine," Abraxas hissed, its voice a guttural growl that sent shivers down Hedvig's spine.
 "His soul is mine to claim, his mind mine to possess."
Hedvig looked at Gogol, a flicker of hope flickering in his heart. But as he reached out to grasp the spectral hand,
 the air around him warped, and the room itself seemed to shift and twist. The walls groaned, and the floorboards
 buckled beneath him, as if the very structure of the house was struggling to contain the monstrous energy emanating from Abraxas.
Suddenly, the ghost of Gogol vanished, leaving Hedvig alone in the darkness with the ancient entity. 
The air grew heavy, thick with the smell of sulfur and decay, and Hedvig felt a cold dread grip his heart. 
The knowledge he had sought, the forbidden secrets, were now a suffocating blanket around him, a cage of his own making.
His mind, overwhelmed by the torrent of information, began to fracture. Images and symbols, fragments of forgotten languages,
 and visions of unspeakable horrors, swirled in his mind, a chaotic kaleidoscope of madness. He felt a sense of detachment, 
as if his own soul was being peeled away, layer by layer, leaving behind a hollow shell.
The whip, now a blur of motion, cracked again and again, each stroke a blow to Hedvig's sanity. He could feel his mind unraveling, 
his thoughts twisting into grotesque parodies of themselves.
He tried to cry out, to call for help, but only a guttural rasp escaped his lips. He was trapped, a prisoner of his own ambition, 
a victim of the terrible power he had unleashed.
As the room descended into chaos, Hedvig looked into the abyss of Abraxas' single, burning eye, and saw a reflection 
of his own twisted reflection, a mirror of his own impending doom.
The price of knowledge, he realized, was not merely a loss of innocence or a sacrifice of sanity. It was a complete annihilation,
 a descent into the heart of darkness, where there was no escape, no redemption, only the cold embrace of oblivion.
And as the world around him shattered into a thousand pieces, Hedvig knew, with a chilling certainty, that he was lost.


Hedvig's world had shattered. The study, once a haven of scholarly pursuit, was now a vortex of chaos.
 The room itself seemed to writhe,

 the walls pulsating with an unseen energy, the air thick with the acrid scent of sulfur and decay.
 The whip, a blur of obsidian fury, cracked again and again, each stroke a blow to Hedvig's sanity. 
He could feel his mind unraveling, his thoughts twisting into grotesque parodies of themselves.
Yet, even amidst the encroaching madness, a flicker of something else emerged within him.
 It was a memory, a whisper of a different life, a life before the shadows had consumed him. 
He thought of Sofia , the young woman who had captured his heart with her fiery spirit and unwavering belief in the impossible. 
She had been his anchor, his connection to the world of the living, a source of warmth and light in his life. 
But his obsession with the mysteries of the occult had driven her away, his pursuit of the unknown 
had left a gaping void in their relationship.
Now, as his mind spiraled into madness, East Sofia 's image became a beacon,
 a lifeline amidst the encroaching darkness. He could feel her presence, a subtle warmth in the chill of the room,
 a whisper of hope in the cacophony of his own internal turmoil.
He remembered their last conversation, a tense exchange filled with hurt and unspoken words. 
He had dismissed her concerns, assured her that he was in control, that his pursuit of knowledge 
was not a descent into madness, but a journey towards enlightenment. But as the shadows of Abraxas closed in, 
he knew he had been wrong.


He felt a surge of guilt, a wave of remorse that washed over him like a tidal wave. He had pushed Sofia  away, 
convinced that his pursuit of the forbidden was more important than her...

He had pushed East Sofia  away, convinced that his pursuit of the forbidden was more important than her love or 
the support she offered. But now, as his world crumbled around him, he realized the true cost of his obsession

The cobblestone streets of London glistened under the faint glow of gaslights, 
reflecting the vibrant hues of West Sofia 's dress as she hurried through the bustling crowds. 
Her auburn hair, escaping its tight bun, danced in the wind, mirroring the tempestuous 
spirit that resided within her.
			    
West Sofia  was a whirlwind of energy, a force of nature trapped in a society that sought to confine her. 
At 22, she was a woman ahead of her time, a passionate advocate for social change, her voice a clarion 
call for women's rights and equality. She had defied her family's expectations, rejecting the gilded cage 
of a traditional life for the freedom of thought and action.

			    Her days were filled with meetings, lectures, and protests. She spoke eloquently at rallies, 
her words igniting the hearts of those who yearned for a better world. She wrote fiery articles for local newspapers,
 her pen a weapon against injustice, her words a challenge to the status quo.

			    But West Sofia  was not just a revolutionary. She was also a dreamer, a romantic at heart, 
who yearned for connection and love. She saw beauty in the ordinary, finding solace in the simple pleasures of life: 
a shared cup of tea with a fellow activist, the scent of fresh-baked bread wafting from a nearby bakery, the laughter 
of children playing in the park.

			    One even - One evening, after a particularly heated debate about women's suffrage,
 she found herself drawn to a quiet corner of the local bookstore, seeking refuge from the chaotic world outside.
 The scent of old paper and leather filled the air, a comforting aroma that calmed her restless spirit.
As she browsed the shelves, her gaze fell upon a worn leather-bound volume, its pages filled with cryptic symbols
 and faded ink. Intrigued, she pulled it from the shelf, her fingers tracing the strange glyphs.

"That's a dangerous book, miss," a voice said from behind her.

			    West Sofia  turned to face the speaker. He was a tall, 
		lean man with piercing blue eyes and a rugged charm. 
His dark hair was neatly combed, but his attire, though impeccably tailored,
			    held a hint of the unconventional.

		"Dangerous?" West Sofia  asked, raising a skeptical eyebrow. "Why would you say that?"
"Those symbols," inky replied, his voice low and compelling,
 "they hold secrets that are not meant for the faint of heart."
"Secrets?" West Sofia  scoffed, her curiosity piqued. "And what secrets might those be?"
inky smiled, a hint of mischief in his eyes.
 "Secrets that could change your world, miss. Secrets that could lead you to places you never imagined."
West Sofia  stared at him, mesmerized by his enigmatic charm. She was drawn to him, 
intrigued by his air of mystery, his hint of danger.
"Tell me," she whispered, her voice laced with a hint of longing.
 "Tell me what secrets these symbols hold."
inky leaned closer, his gaze burning into hers. 
"But be warned, miss," he said, his voice a seductive whisper. 
"The price of knowledge can be high."
West Sofia  felt a thrill course through her. She had always sought knowledge, 
always been willing to push the boundaries, to defy expectations.
"I'm not afraid of a little danger," she said, her eyes locking with his.
And thus began Sofia 's journey into the unknown, a journey that would intertwine 
her fate with Hedvig's, a journey that would lead them both down a path fraught with danger and intrigue.

West Sofia , ever the seeker of truth, delved deeper into the world of symbols and secrets.

Inky became her guide, her confidant, her muse. He was a scholar of the occult, 

a man who walked the tightrope between reason and revelation, logic and the mystical.

He spoke of ancient deities and forgotten rituals, of the power of symbols and the interconnectedness
 of all things. He opened her eyes to a world beyond the mundane, a world of hidden truths and forbidden knowledge.

Often, he dreamt of the arctic...His plan was to write a book as wild and cool as that land...then called
Russian America, later the Department of Alaska, until it became the District of Alaska, and perhaps
finally the State of Alaska...

West Sofia , captivated by his intellect and the allure of the unknown, found herself drawn to his world. 
She was a woman who craved understanding, who sought answers to the fundamental questions of existence. 
Hedvig offered her a glimpse into a realm beyond the confines of her own beliefs, a realm where logic intertwined 
with faith, where the boundaries between the physical and the spiritual blurred.

As she delved deeper into his world, however, she began to question the true nature of Inky's pursuit. 
His obsession with the Alaska, his relentless pursuit of forbidden knowledge, began to consume him,
 casting a shadow over his spirit. He became a man consumed by the shadows, his heart shrouded in snow.

West Sofia , ever the optimist, clung to the belief that beneath the icy frost, Inky's heart still held a flicker of light. 
She tried to pull him back from the abyss, to remind him of the beauty and simplicity of life, of the importance of 
human connection and compassion. But her efforts proved futile.

Inky, lost in his own labyrinth of esoteric knowledge, was blind to her pleas. 
He became a man consumed by his obsession, 
a prisoner of his own curiosity.

West Sofia , heartbroken and disillusioned, realized the true cost of faith, the danger of obsession, 
and the thin line between spiritual exploration and self-destruction.

She had seen the depths of human ambition, the destructive power of unchecked curiosity, 
and the darkness that lurks beneath the surface of even the brightest minds. 
She had glimpsed the allure of forbidden knowledge,
 and the price one pays for seeking truth beyond the veil of the ordinary.

And so, West Sofia , the woman who once sought enlightenment through knowledge and reason, found herself 
questioning the very nature of belief. She realized that faith, like knowledge, was a double-edged sword. 
It could be a source of comfort, a guiding light in the darkness, but it could also be a dangerous obsession,
 a path to self-destruction.

Her journey had begun with a thirst for knowledge, but it ended with a profound understanding of the human condition: 
a complex tapestry woven with threads of faith, reason, and the ever-present temptation to push the boundaries of the known,
 even at the cost of one's own soul.

	In the depths of the Alaskan wilderness,
where the snow falls endlessly and the darkness seems
to stretch on forever, there lived a young woman named Lotta.
She had grown up in the small, isolated cabin with her father,
a grizzled old man who rarely spoke and spent his days hunting 
	and trapping in the unforgiving landscape. 
 
From a young age, Lotta had learned to fend for herself, 
her father teaching her how to shoot a rifle and track elusive prey through 
the snowy forest.
			    
But as the years went by, a sense of unease began
to settle over the cabin, as Lotta noticed her father's 
			    
	increasingly erratic behavior...
 
He would come home late at night, his eyes wild 
and his hands shaking, muttering to himself about
sierra leone and strange voices he heard in the wind. 

lotta tried to ignore it, burying herself in her social
media and spending as much time as she could outside,
	away from the suffocating atmosphere of the cabin. 
 
But one fateful night, as a blizzard raged outside and the wind 
howled like a tormented spirit, Lotta awoke to the sound of her
	father's screams. Racing down the stairs, 
she found him thrashing on the floor,
his eyes wide with terror 
as he clawed at his own skin. 
 
Father, what's wrong?! Lotta cried, 
kneeling beside him and trying to restrain his
flailing limbs. But her father's gaze was distant, 
lost in some unseen horror as he whispered in a voice 
	that chilled her to the bone. 
 
The Sierra Leone curse...it's upon me, Lotta.
I can't...
I can't fight it any longer. 

The S.L. was of course an entirely different country
on the other side of the world, as well as well known
horse that had rallied in the fierceness to come in 
second and now sought to take the travers stake...

However, in ther ir wilderness the S. L. was what
the natives called the frenzy that made the minds
of men feverish with craze.
 
Lotta's blood ran cold as she remembered 
the stories her father had told her about 
	the mythical malady that haunted the
Alaskan wilderness, a malovence of darkness and despair
that feasted on the souls of the living.
			    
She had always thought they were just tales to scare her,
but now she saw the fear in her father's eyes and
	knew that something truly evil had taken hold of him. 
 
Desperate to save her father, Lotta searched through the cabin 
	until she found his rifle, loading it with shaking hands 
as she tried to come up with a plan. But as she turned back to her 
father, she saw a look of pure malice in his eyes, 
as if he no longer recognized her as his daughter. 
 
With a sudden and terrifying speed, her father lunged at her,
	his hands clawing for her throat as he snarled like a wild 
	animal.
			    
In a blind panic, Lotta raised the rifle and squeezed the trigger,
	the deafening roar of the gunshot echoing through the cabin
as her father's body fell limp at her feet. 
 
For a moment, all was silent as lotta stood there in shock,
	her hands shaking and her heart pounding in her chest. 
	And then, as the reality of what she had done sank in,
		a new kind of fear washed over her,
	as she realized the consequences of her actions. 

A vision of the handgun flashed in her mind's eye, she sauntered
to the chest of drawers inside the immense wood cabinet and pulled
it out. It felt light, in a silly motion she cocked the thirty
eight while pointing it at herself. the bracelet seemed to play
the start of song that would not get to be heard as her arm
swung down weighed by the revolver that now aimed at the possessd
man - she thought - perhaps he is dead but the spirit has to die
as well. five of the six shots burst in his torso. if the floor
had ever thirsted for blood, she thought, now is time to drink.
she looked on as what seemed to her a rothko color melting crimson
and brown...Swimming into adjacent rugs. The floor had not not 
known bloodlust, she concluded then slightly raised the pistol
to finish with a head shot that somehow found its way into the
crotch. All the better, she judged, in case the testicles held
any potential of procreating more of that feverish insanity...
 she had grown up on science documentaries and the idea
of psr struck her as the groin bled out.  no posthumous sperm
retrieval for this demon, she had now grown up again
instantly and without choice. the six shooter left
alongside the rifle and her innocence.
			
Alone in the dark and icy wilderness, with a corpse at her feet 
	and the echoes of her father's dying screams still ringing 
	in her ears, lotta knew that she would never be able to 
	escape the horror of that night. The sierra leone's curse had 
	taken her father, and now it threatened to consume her as well. 
 
As the blizzard raged on outside, lotta gathered what belongings 
	she could carry and fled into the night, leaving behind 
	the only home she had ever known and the memories of a man 
	who had once been her father. 
			
	But no matter how far she ran, she could never escape the haunting
	cries of the darkness, a constant reminder of the night she had been
	forced to confront her own deepest fears and commit the ultimate act 
	of horror...

yes, instead of reworking  the film script words, we opted
to start a second book about alaska, because in reviewing
these notes we felt the native people should be at the
lead - their history, culture, customs...
yet it is planned in the dystopian genre ...
the download is more or less how we would
have started it all given a second chance. enjoy.
	
			    

wordstar tokenizer ;

yes, after the tokenizer, i continued to delay
the alaska projects...but dear readers, it
was not to leave things unedited or untidy,
it was only following my bliss...
even made a silent film
https://files.offshore.cat/S62oamul.mp4
no i have not been only sleeping and
masturbating, don't listen to spin doctor
perverts...in fact i am about to update
dejavu glitches very soon...
otherwise i was hell bent on leathering
up a word processor which you may find
at wordstar.nexus/typewriter or download
as a private offline app
<a href="https://github.com/ghostm68/eg/raw/main/typewriter3269.exe"> here</a>
which lead me to another app;
wordstar.nexus/cut&rune
and a dictionary;
wordstar.nexus/daslexicon
along with the retro;
https://inkrealm.info/atari
and my new favorite:
wordstar.nexus/birch
(a screenwriting app)
of course, you know all this if you
follow the scribbles at wordstar.nexus/displaywriter
all this to say i might not be exactly
done making this space wait...
but i am confident you will agree
some of that waiting was worth while
as the usefulness of the new developments
might prove. - inky.
