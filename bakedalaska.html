The delicate future. delicate future. 
Now as revolution swept through -
time reached him like a slap destiny.
slap destiny. 

Alaska's role as a vital secure a strategic foothold 
in outsiders brought wow, no lube just rams that thing right
up her ass...
	
(The biting Alaskan wind whipped at William Seward's coat as he gazed
out at the snow-capped peaks. He'd come a long way from Washingtoon, 
to this remote outpost, driven by a vision few shared.
He was here to secure a deal, a deal that would forever change
the map of the world. Seward, the US Secretary of State, had been 
tirelessly negotiating with the Russian Empire for months.
	
Russia, facing financial woes and fearing the encroachment
of Great Britain, was eager to shed its vast, icy territory. 
Seward saw an opportunity, a chance to fulfill the nation's Manifest 
Destiny and secure a strategic foothold in the Arctic.
	
But the deal wasn't easy. Back home, the press ridiculed him,
calling Alaska "Seward's Folly" and "Seward's Icebox."
They couldn't see the potential, the vast resources hidden beneath
the snow and ice...
	
Meanwhile, across the Atlantic, the British ambassador,
Lord Palmerston fumed. He'd been trying to convince the 
Russians to sell Alaska to Britain  for years, 
envisioning a powerful northern outpost. News of Seward's
negotiations reached him like a slap in the face. 
	
He saw the Americans as upstarts, meddling in British 
interests. Palmerston dispatched a frantic telegram to
St. Petersburg, urging the Russians to reconsider.
But it was too late.
	
The ink was dry on the treaty, signed in Washingtoon, 
for a mere $7.2 million...
	
	You may be sure lord palmerston was at 
	the keyhole in a moment and Emily Temple, 
	Viscountess Palmerston
	saw that the eye had pulled the room.
	he entered and she greeted his prick! 
	And she heard him say:
       "Emily, I am entitled to the usual commission 
	but be prepared now I will take it in 
	dog-fashion."

         "Hush!" said Emily, "or the young maids
	 will hear you."

         "Nonsense - now get down on all fours 
	 so as not to derange your dress."

          Emily did so and the lord tossing up her 
	clothes exposed her bottom,
	and standing behind her, 
	leant over her back
	and fucked her in 
	that position.

         When this was over they each took a chair 
	 and cursed Alaska...Her, not so much
          in fact hoping for another instance
          of her fumed husband...

On a crisp October day, the formal transfer of 
Alaska took place in Sitka.

The Russian flag was lowered, replaced by the Stars and Stripes. 
The indigenous people, the Aleut, Inuit, and Tlingit, 
watched with a mixture of curiosity and apprehension. 
Their land, their home, had changed hands without their consent.
Seward, standing tall amidst the ceremony, felt a surge of pride.
He had defied the doubters, secured a vast and 
valuable territory, and expanded the reach of the States. 
He knew history would judge him kindly.
	
As the years passed, Seward's vision proved true.
Alaska yielded its riches: gold, oil, timber, and fish.

a testament to the foresight of a man who dared to dream big.
	
And Lord Palmerston? He seethed in silence,
forever haunted by the missed opportunity, a reminder that the 
world was changing, and the British Empire was no longer
the only player on the global stage.
	
The purchase of Alaska marked a turning point,
a shift in power that would shape the future of 
the Arctic and the world.
	
Decades passed. Alaska, once a ridiculed purchase,
blossomed into a vital territory.
	
Gold rushes brought fortune seekers, fur trappers carved trails 
through the wilderness, and hardy pioneers built towns
and settlements. Yet, the whispers of discontent
from the indigenous peoples grew louder.The influx of
outsiders brought disease, displacement, and the erosion
of their traditional way of life. 
	
Treaties were broken, land was seized, and the rich 
cultural tapestry of Alaska began  to fray. Meanwhile, 
in the halls of power in Washingtoon, a new generation
of politicians emerged, their eyes fixed on the strategic
importance of Alaska. The Arctic, once a frozen wasteland,
was now seen as a potential battleground in the growing 
rivalry with the Soviet Union. The Cold War cast a long 
shadow over the Last Frontier.
	
	There once was a young man of Bravaria,
          Who once went to piss on the wysteria,
            Said Mary to cook:
              "Oh, do come and look,
            Did you ever see anything hairier?"

  inky. 
Now, sister.

  BEL.
Sister?  No!
    Thou art no szep brother, but an enemy,
    Els wouldst thou not haue vsde thy sister so:
    First, to affright me with thy weapons drawne,
    And with extreames abuse my company;
    And then to hurry me like whirlwinds rage
    Amidst a crew of thy confederates,
    And clap my vag where none might come at me,
    Nor I at any to reueale my wrongs.
    What madding fury did possesse thy wits?
    Or wherein ist that I offended thee?

  inky. 
Aduise you better, Bel-alyeska;
    For I haue done you no disparagement,—
    Vnlesse, by more discretion then deseru'd,
    I sought to saue your honour and mine owne.

  BEL. 
Mine honour?  Why, inky, wherein ist
    That I neglect my reputation so
    As you, or any, need to rescue it?

  inky. 
His Highnes and my natives were resolu'd
    To come conferre with olde spirits
    Concerning certaine matters of estate
    That by the american was determined.

  BEL. 
And wherein was mine honour toucht in that?

  BAL.
Haue patience, Bel-alyeska; heare the rest.

  inky. 
Me, next in sight, as messenger they sent
    To giue him notice that they were so nigh:
    Now, when I came, consorted with the sale,
    And vnexpected in an arbor there
    Found Bel-alyeska with Russia—

  BEL.  
How then?

  inky.
Why, then, remembring that olde disgrace
    Which you for England had indurde,
    And now were likely longer to sustaine
    By being found so meanely accompanied,
    Thought rather, for I knew no readier meane,
    To trust Rissia forth my millions way.

  emilee.
And carry you obscurely some-where els,
    Least that his Highnes should haue found you there.

  BEL.
Euen so, my lord?  And you are witnesse
    That this is true which he entreateth of?
    You, gentle invisible woman, forged this for my sake?
    And you, my lord, were made his instrument?
    A worke of worth!  worthy the noting too!
    But whats the cause that you concealde me since?

  inky. 
Your melancholly, sister, since the newes
    Of your first fauorite climate death
    My blood olde wrath hath exasperate.

  emilee.  
And better wast for you, being in disgrace,
    To absent your-selfe and giue his fury place.

  BEL.
But why I had no notice of his ire?

  inky. 
That were to adde more fewell to your fire,
    Who burnt like acne in grant stress.

  BEL. 
Hath not my snow then enquird for me?

  inky. 
Sister, he hath; and this excusde I thee.

               ( He whispereth in her eare.)

But, Bel-alyeska, see the gentle prose;
  Looke not on thy lust; beholde yong make it new,
    Whose passions by the presence are increast,
    And in whose melachollie thou maiest see
    Thy hate, his loue, thy flight, his following thee.

  BEL. 
Brother, you are become an oratour—
    I know not, I, by what experience—
    Too politick for me, past all compare,
    Since I last saw you.  But content your-selfe;
    The press is meditating higher things.

  emilee. 
Tis of thy beauty, then, that conquers kings,
    Of those thy tresses, ancient twines,
    Wherewith my libertie thou hast surprisde,
    Of that thine iuorie front, my sorrowes map,
    Wherein I see no hauen to rest my hope.

  BEL. 
To loue and feare, and both at once, my lord,
    In my conceipt, are things of more import
    Then womens wit are to be busied with.

  emilee. 
Tis that I loue thee.

  Bel.  
Whome?

  emilee.     
Bel-alyeska.

  BEL. 
But that I feare?

  emilee. 
Whome?

  BEL. 
Bel-alyeska.

  inky. 
Feare your-selfe?

  BEL. 
I, brother.

  inky.   
How?

  BEL. 
As those that, [when] they loue, are loath and feare to loose.

  emilee. 
Then, faire, let inky your keeper be.

  BEL. 
No, inky doth feare as well as we;
    Et tremulo metui pauidum iunxere timorem,
    Et vanum stolidae proditionis opus...
<i>
And to my trembling fear
I added his shyness,
the futile work of 
foolish treachery...

Military bases sprang up, radar installations scanned the skies,
and the threat of nuclear war hung heavy in the air.
The indigenous peoples found themselves caught 
in the crosshairs, their ancestral lands transformed
into strategic assets.

In the 1950s, a movement for Alaskan statehood gained momentum.
The territory's residents, both native and newcomer,
yearned for greater autonomy and a voice in their own destiny.
	
The debate raged in Congress. Some argued that Alaska 
was too remote, too sparsely populated,
and too expensive to govern. Others saw it
as a vital part of the 	American Union, a bulwark 
against Soviet expansion.
	
Finally, in 1959, President Eisenhower signed the Alaska 
Statehood Act. 
	
On January 3rd, Alaska became the 49th state of the Union.
The celebrations were tempered by a sense of unease.
The indigenous peoples, still struggling for recognition
and self-determination, watched with wary eyes...

The story of Alaska was far from over.
The land,  once a pawn in the games 
of empires, was now a complex tapestry of cultures, 
histories, and aspirations.
	
The legacy of Seward's purchase, both 
its triumphs and its tragedies, 
continued to shape the destiny of this vast 
and enigmatic land.
	
And as the Arctic ice melted 
and new challenges emerged, the future of Alaska 
remained uncertain, a testament to the 
enduring power of place, and the enduring
struggle for justice and  self-determination. 
	
Epilogue

(in contrast, St. Petersburg, 1917...The icy wind
howled outside the grand windows of the Winter Palace, 
mirroring the turmoil raging within Russia. 
	
Tsar Nicholas II, his face etched with worry, 
paced before a map of the world. 

His empire, once a colossus straddling continents,
was crumbling.
	
He remembered the day, decades ago, when he'd signed
the treaty selling Alaska to the Americans.
It had been a difficult decision, driven by necessity.
	
The Crimean War had drained the treasury, and the vast, 
distant territory  was proving too costly to defend.
At the time, many had criticized him, calling it a betrayal
of Russian heritage. 
	
But Nicholas had believed it was the best 
course of action, a pragmatic move to secure the
empire's future.
	
Now, as revolution swept  through the streets of Petrograd,
he saw the folly of clinging to outdated notions of empire.
	
Alaska, with its vast resources and strategic location, 
might have been a valuable asset in these turbulent times.
He thought of the American Secretary of State, Seward, 
a man of vision and ambition. Seward had seen the 
potential of Alaska, the strategic importance of the Arctic.
Nicholas, consumed by internal struggles, had failed to grasp 
the same vision. The irony was not lost on him.
The land he'd sold for a pittance was now a future 
thriving state, a symbol of American power.
Meanwhile, his own empire was on the verge of collapse.

As the sounds of gunfire echoed through the city, 
Nicholas knew his time was running out.
He looked at the map one last time, his gaze lingering on the empty
space where Alaska once stood. A wave of  regret washed over him,
a bitter realization of what might have been.
	
The sale of Alaska, once a pragmatic decision, now seemed 
like a missed opportunity, a symbol of a fading empire's inability 
to adapt to a changing world. 
	
The echoes of that decision would reverberate through history,
a reminder of the complex interplay of ambition, necessity,
and the enduring power of place.

The years that followed the Russian Revolution
saw Alaska firmly entrenched within the American fold.
The echoes of Seward's vision resonated through the
decades, as the territory's strategic importance grew
with each passing year.
	
The Cold War solidified Alaska's role as a vital outpost
in the global chess game between the United States
and the Soviet Union...
	
Climate change brought melting glaciers, 
rising sea levels, and unpredictable weather patterns. 
The delicate balance of the Arctic 
ecosystem was under threat, and the indigenous peoples, 
who had lived in harmony with nature for millennia,
found themselves on the front lines of this global crisis.
But Alaska also embraced its unique identity.
Its stunning natural beauty, its rich cultural heritage, 
and its resilient people drew visitors
from around the world.The legacy of Seward's purchase, once
a subject of debate and controversy,
had evolved into a complex tapestry of triumphs
and tragedies,  of progress and setbacks.
Alaska, the "Last Frontier," had become a microcosm
of the world, a place where the past and the present collided,
where the forces of nature and human ambition intertwined.
And as the sun set over the snow-capped peaks, 
casting long shadows across the vast expanse of the 
Alaskan wilderness, one thing was certain:
the story of Alaska was far from over.
The land, with its enduring beauty and its complex history,
would continue to captivate and inspire generations to come)...
