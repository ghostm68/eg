dream note 20 october;a drawer full of money, didn't count it...rush into a stranger;s house; hurrying out into unknown sidewalk... 
	21, dreams blurred, updated artbreeder, redesigned wordstar.cyclic.app ...26, dream of dancing dwarves, i thought they were singing -
	the day brought disturbing news; a new nose limit, looks like your nose is running...redecorated inkrealm.info intro - lawrence welk 1978 
	face lift skit - six masterchef tumblers brought to mind you only live twice - tiger and ai the manuscript at 14,351 words - 
	i don't believe britney wroted that book, dear ramona, i have opted to replace you as my astrologer, as a girl in new zealand has won the contract 
	- oh lorde -27th iran rough draft done yay -thought about lara but dreamt of clara extra sleep felt so good - 
	dream maria sent me a purse with haul within, tan designer frames - friends, briana brancato edited out of reports but why  - 
	explosion in a cafeteriaesque place i collect my backpack items on the other side and awake -
	in the middle of slutty halloween costumes and heather in the hp lovecraft remake my erection smiled...
	www.inkrealm.info/about, planned and deployed, i think i slept well, but in my dream a brown cat was visiting skirt 
	and tried to steal five compact discs, terribly upsetting fight followed but at least it weren't a human cat fight...
	the irony of all these parties while the dance of wars waltzes, in a dream under glass like iggy pop song lyric 
	peter o'toole saunters by straightfaced alone passenger, portrait of mrs  kessler @ itsnotalive, yes this is nonlinear
	but that was the only time i really voted...day of the dead, scary monsters and super creeps in dreams i guess it awoke my thoughts before i got up, 
	screenplay in mind.

			3 november, speaking with an aunt i never speak to, how do you sleep, deletion demo, i don't want to lose you, 
	you say yes and i say no, butcher's crossing, notice the reports advanced Ai long before our hands had, back in the dream i don't want to agree 
	to a divorce because the wife's family name serves me well for society and banking and such, i get up afraid of my fictional greed, 
	dear icloud; why take up laptop space at all? n4, nearly good transition scenes at iran photoplay, still never can get used to going 
	against myself, the movie can only hint at the story, glimpses, unlike an actual story - wish i could have told f scott fitzgerald it 
	is almost exactly not writing - i get up too early for my own good, thinking of chloe and how wonderful it is to have people like that in the world
	...saturday spilled water broken haus cup, didn;t write instead "home" paged inkrealm.info, dream call but i haven't met elly, 
	martin rest ibanez at work...alarmed mother made me dress for dream guest, i ask about another aunt, he says horrible,
	i notice he is short and fat, maybe it was quarantine, or rem imposter, didnt feel like anything after that, did write a scene - 
	forced inspiration only leads to editing - later dreams a fashion show girls sitting and walking runway in fredrick's of hollywood blue 
	alike emilee's blouse - i suppose i miss her i suppose i always will - one of them like astbury when i had yet to figure out the similarity
	to aleksandra - movie with allard memories with leonor - i walk out with a rolling stone knight not even surprised we cant get no satisfaction
	- or is it keira siddenly apron never filt so attractive - the broken jacuzzi lined with crawling ants, i had nearly wept over jean harlow in 
	saratoga - everything is too expensive and i am reading ballard's cocaine nights, halfway through.n8, copyright the dementia fashion line 
	with a sub brand called senility, tagline outfit repetition is the new black, dream technicolor screen within a dior advent box a woman is showing
	me two variations, crowded room not the series some man sits atop a stack of my writing i feel upset then fury as he fondles the pages -
	i pull him out and away kicking out the boy that seemed to be with him - i load up on chicken rice and onions watching foe but
	i don't like it paul still feels like a tv actor not a character actor wasnt normal pee pole a few days ago and now ready for lifetime achievement
	awards - the gladiator governent should have been played by elton john, they could ve used his songs, crocodile rocket and such,
	say or see tits out in a badly edited film, i only held on till the bitter end for her sake, no regrets pay the ticket take the ride,
	in ladybird we trust.<br>

			n10, inertia no dream yet it might be that oppenheimer was overwhelming or the ralph lauren wood hanger resolution was kicking 
	in - kept hoping that it was daniel playing the lead but murphy's law i guess - mrs parker no relation to spiderman doubles 5,
	me dishes to dish out steak with killer wherin i saw more of the country than i have since obligatory vaccine, dude my dog story on the screen, 
	what exactly does burroughs have to be proud of...heavy metal, maybe i met someone in secret before i  said it, a secret kept even from myself?
	xmas credit seven cents back to staking, plus tvc 15 in the plan to update, boxes in a before dream coming thru the disconnected tele, a lovely
	thing that vanished as i reached for the second after knocking on the guest room door to find a naked woman's torso tits out as the beloved lesbian
	said, bronzed but bushy asian type bush, distrust followed since the disdain of masked days...talk of fumigation i am concerned for the kitten,
	skirt, exterminator instead of cleaning feels ironic - iran script over the time frame i want it to be seventy odd minutes - took all the vitamins,
	played all the scales. n11 hearing from the self proclaimed cyborg girl was the day's highlight, daria bought enough zara to open her own store, 
	i pondered and procrastinated secure in no hurry after dreaming i was with two very tall men, sort of like actors i admire, the face off leads to
	be precise, cozy with the cat contrary to the dark girl soundtrack, refried steak meal, finishing cocaine nights, itchy at five afternoon no relation
	to koo park, eleven in the moring new zealand already the next day.dear iceland i will release roadhouse blues for you then

		.n13,
	cocaine nights which i thought goodly turned into anticlimax wrap stitching the foreshadowed scenes together - by contrast rumble in the dark felt
	awful but had me in tears at the end -oh momma dream of the city sauntering as if under surveillance then a candle lit room looking at a dylan song
	awoke at two thinking it was six - stuck inside of mobile with the dirty laundry again -kick 'em when up or down, verbs call dictionary
	to add chatgpt'd - marlene told me to cover king horse, bleedthrough tracking, exported wav as mp3 didnt waveform, skip sound reaper,
	nearly good, usb went blind, later feeling axe too loud went back to find no windows, reset and reinstall everything,  
	talent is not enough for these situations, patience - remixed second version, perhaps vocals too low - now i see why the bible tells us not to speak
	to spirits - in dreams a girl has writing scribbled on her back she turns topless raising her arms brick red armpits - i'm reading super cannes - 
	i awake up minutes after dozing off - cigarettes coffee murder an obvioulsy dazed cockroach that has wandered through the hall perhaps chased
	by skirt with labs suspicion over the laptop weirdness -i'm hungry but i think it away only find dream hog-like men as i get lost in a spanish 
	town reverie- they are barefeet hoofesque - i can hear one of them say hey remember him - the streets are empty -get up early from the nightmare
	hear the tracks again hoping that it is near enough to what i thought i heard in the headphones - in rushing right into whatever i recorded on 
	first take while still learning the song gives me a sense of being high but often enough it is obvious why some artists spend weeks or months
	in the adventure - my thoughts are scattered as if still tangled in dreams or dietrich...n15 final touches on the iran photoplay, in a dream
	i am in a bar within a park excited to pick up drinks for some girlfriend, among the libations a towering mug of ale as some rude bloke nears
	saying i thought you didn't drink and i saunter away getting lost in the process climbing to nowhwere road littered with stray pieces of two by
	fours - get up thinking of emilee yet confused and distracted - the day wants a shampoo, the day wants to paint the front room, the day wants 
	to do the dishes before cooking, the day wants to take out the trash - i go back to sleep until noon and avoid most of it except somehow a few
	things get done anyway, still concerned over asking a question in my thoughts and hearing some sort of upset voice respond...like a haunting,
	the inner seance of a split second like never before and can't say if it will speak again, i did try but then only heard myself -
	no ceremony or invokation, simply a weird magic or perhaps confirming alien mind contact...too many transmissions in the air...or as i wroted, 
	this much talk is too much tape. n17/18, elevator 8th graders except we are grown in dream, greatg fun with knight without armor, morg rocklin,
	and cloe borden, weird to note it only a few days before her end date- the answer comes before the question - 
	dream zelda at hungarian pastry shop - and then tropical storm i see where the devil roams - too happy at last - otherwise put out book of shadows -
	kremlin says the times might be fbi - felt as strange as henry lee's press on nails -lost relay glasses slavery revolt -
	kristie thompson = astrologer, inkow its annoying this scrooge scroll and i will make it a box asap - paris hilton date yet i have a leech like scab
	right next to nose i pull it off notice pink red circle marks and convince my reflection i look fine then rush to meet her
	-nearing the end of super cannes i can't help feeling ballard was vying for a bit of flemings's bond - strangely. a saturday so wet, 
	sunday might be drowned out until monday - dream lara's gibson but more like a les paul jr - two strings i take the stage loving the sound
	from the sinlge string a warm old tube sound with just a hint of buzz, guitar like italian restaurant cloth matching my plaid shirt i notice 
	awaking without thinking of the yiddish beshirt,  steak potatoes i wish i knew more languages or the people to practice them with to be more precise
	- can one exeunt from dream note...many thanks for the vote of confidence, mw. <br>

	n19, gothic table marilyn manson scene dissolved into conversation with mila kunis the narrative a wild story about an erotic bank 
	where withdrawls are based on a performed sexual act - i got up thinking it would make an enticing novella - 	
	n20, blow job bank of jerk and rubbers incorporated...did any hairdresser ever want to get into the profession because of the incident
	in dallas, talk about messing up a hair style...finishing super cannes i find myself thinking i was wrong only partly
	right as he put placed ot that chorus line of james bonds description and dissolved into with his former title greet the end, but none
	of us after shakespeare can ever near the stunning precision of that particular play - perhaps he had some other goal i couldnt see- 
	certainly a few dazzling sentences...i got through the pasta day and cheesed my way through the film, in part upset that VS corrupted
	some of it as i sat there recalling that trite fashion campaign and how ello vanished taking with it my homage to hellbender
	instead of the magical movie - yet on second slide screening all of that is secondary and i simply think i need to view it a third 
	time to catch all the songs - in the dream i am catching plumbs that are scattered around my shopping bag - i am taking them in
	reaction to having been asked to leave - but i was not buying fruit...slice of bread and sugared orange monday...sigh.
	struggle dream recalled rollup metal gate except spirits and or demons seemed to be fly floating as i entered
	they were within as well - an uneasy feeling...yet i cannot catagorize it as nightmare - right fare reading my jimmy's portrait -
	it's a genius that doesn't make you jealous for heartfelt awe one finds in the poetry as if effortless...weird to then walk
	into the wax of the teacher's lounge...deutsch cinema - magical actress - meanwhile in dreams a writer walks into a bar but
	it is not a skit, standing there a woman put places two envelopes in his left pocket - then a little girl reaches out and
	slides his zipper up and down - as the motion repeats, he tears the envelope without removing it from his pocket - takes out
	the money and inserts it in his shirt pocket - he takes steps away from the girl as she finally paused the up and down
	greeting - he imagines a land where people don't shake hands but pull at their zippers for a few seconds that must always feel
	like too many minutes or more - a criminal feeling possesses him as if he had stolen the cash, he worries and climbs onto rooftop 
	where a man sprays a neon tinted water from a hose, the liquid nearing as if an ocean's wave in flourescent teal - he awakes wishing 
	he was still writing his book, there is a strange feeling a sensation that it was a stranger in his own dream - he goes back to 
	sleep but then no dreams arrive only a pair of hands - not his but someone is mocking them and it turns his stomach with some
	sort of illogical fear - he awakes frightened - cigarette thinking of bill wyman -rome flashback, i will cut off your pink 
	hands and nail them to the senate door - coffee settled down - now typing the consideration of cyborg girl, no hands - 
	for a while, a very long while it is why i refused certain types of comedy - no wish to explore endless irony - how i miss the
	city on thanksgiving, i try not to think it but in having a sort of usual meal well...at least i had this very clear vision
	of emilee as to nearly blur the line of reality and fantasy - in another dream the line between life and death also blurred
	as i was with an ex girlfriend, like the silent breakup or years had vanished, walking through living room her family is there,
	her dead father sitting at the top of the room saying come here it's almost like we grew up together and he pulls me in an
	embrace - i had worn his shoes and dreamt of his other daughter holding me when he passed away...i sigh satisfied that this
	ghost is being kind to me - smiling even, then the ex is nervous - a lost notebook, i know the one she means as if we were
	back in school of course i didn't go to school with her - she pleads and i go on a wild escapade to find her mead but instead
	find a stack of notebooks littering the hallway - none of them the one we are looking for - i get up certain that there is
	another timeline and in that dimension we are together as no other logic could or would explain that feeling as i glanced into here 
	knowing for sure they were all there in this space - strong till the finish not because i eat my spin-ache - popeyes now in
	town i hope church's comes next - the feeling subsides - what is real is that i miss emilee and suddenly memory kicks
	in the drawn heart on her hand nearly where that ex had a heart-shaped scar - perhaps it was about her in some way i cannot
	understand - or worse about myself and how love was never what it used be except in thought. i look at one of the videos
	i saved in my files and feel myself tremble in ethereal emotion. n24, riots in dublin - surely over alexandra and reece
	nipples - i get up knowing i dreamt some shabby room where kids were white mouthed not from foaming but eating - i know 
	think of one of my own lines from some forgot poem, the milk broken inside her mouth...i son't recall the verse or
	the dream as i stumble around waking up wondering if she is on her way to work - the day struggles against a trip to the 
	shop - aren't you missing anyhtning else, i respond well if everyone got everything they were missing we'd all be in trouble-
	i have a slice a bread olives and cheese then heat up the leftovers - taking a look at peaky blinders but i don't like it -
	it's a lot more fun to look at ganna with her horses in cairo - the day slips away as i try to defend emilee from 
	imagined dangers lurking in scrambled words - not knowing if i succeeded - i try to purchase a westinghouse fan but it is
	yet to arrive - i do purchase the hornet deelay and find myself thanking lara as i felt her good wishes when i missed the
	septmeber sale, eighty cents now still feels nearly free - eight oclock and im pretty sure nothing else is getting done
	tonight leaving me five days or so to complete and edit that fifty thousand word novel thing not to mention doing the
	dishes - letters from unkown women one of them promising to love me forever - just when i thought romance was a thing
	of the past...i tell the other one it is next to impossible that we will ever even meet.

			n26, i'm sure i'm at some
	beach or faraway sand planet - i catch a glimpse of a man that looks like bowie - the woman with me is invisible,
	the woman walking first towards him and then us steps upon him and i watch as he is buried in the sand one eye
	open as if searching for a way back after being so gently but surely trampled - i can't tell who the woman is -
	i get up hoping it is that emilee has read my letter right and opted to come and stay - in the dream the word stirn
	is being repeated or perhaps stern - myriam is a doctor - i operate on promotional materials for minaro - 
	the results will be temporarily available at www.inkrealm.info - gloomy forehead at the thought of washing dishes - 
	fear of wiretaps - cool picture from iran i translated - dream dante cape cod song i hadn't heard in a while felt
	like a friend - my other thought was wondering why i cannot bring myself to self-promote in the way i so eagerly
	and enthusiastically do for lara...the thrill-feelings i had while minaro weaving are simply not there when it
	comes to my own promotional materials - i do them mostly as a requirement like homework - even creating websites -
	i only find that sooner or later i want to create another possibly because i am not emotionally connected at 
	the process of creation as i am with say my new dream note sponsor. weird, no?<br>

			n27-28wild slip slide fast forward dream in the fact i have to get up to receive a delivery i never read the news,
	they say arriving later than expected - abilene town is the weirdest western i ever seen - in the dream
	i'm sure speaking to emilee yet in that whirl forward fast slide slip away awaking to recall only a white
	tee - then i'm here but also in paris - where the coffee bag broke and lumani carried the cups in her hand
	discarding the water bottle - i discard a film called the lesson not liking the vague nature of the lead -
	hedy lamarr joins my excellent meal - i am certain of wanting to get even more sleep and do - encountering
	an old lady sitting on my sofa, we speak, i note her nose is pointier than her sister - i have not really
	met gloria's sister except in passing - for a second i think it is keira in the future yet in the scene
	emilee is not near - there is a practice amp, like my fender when i had a les paul, stepping into the room virginia 
     on the bed thighs mid air feet on the dresser i touch them
	estimating a size six, five she says in a flirty way so when i get to my own bed i find myself confessing
	the attraction when the woman laying ontop of me asks for a secret - i nibble kiss her collar bone and
	see her orgasm - she reminds me of caitlin and naturally i think of milo - the cat not the funk superstar -
	hmm- suddenly it was back to that frenzy intensity as if something had to be hidden - i'm in a bar asking
	for a second guinness worried that they are going to charge me for both although i have already paid the first -
	there is a girl with me and she tells me to be careful as i pull out a stack of currency notes one of them
	falling to the ground as if to make her point - obviously from the blow job bank of jerks and rubbers incorporated,
	where sperm turns to cash - coin baby in slot vagina insanity - i dunno - as a nondrinker, i'm certain the dream
	was without me - me i was busy in abu dhabi wondering how much trouble estelle might be in - out of 
	fathers into fears - hope feathers what was it burroughs told, ah yes, like Spain I am bound to the past -
	present after midnight the kitten skirt making a speech - cat talk for clean up my litter box now - wait
	forgot to frog that erotica erin oh kneel she had torn bicep flesh as if bitten away on the other side
	of keira's sun smile and moon ink -i have a coke everyday... i get up with no link to any of it concerned over the cell phone
	reflected in her eyewear - leap of faith one more listen to cape cod girls aint got no combs, they comb their hair with a
	cod fish bone - weave into velvet moon and wroted this mind drift sponsored by minaro new york a fashion
	brand exploring the concept of surveillance now in their second collection, available everywhere.

	    n29, midnight closed browser instead of tab so this part is reprinted from moments ago recollections -
	    i kept telling myself i only needed a few days to complete nanowrimo but i only needed a few hours -
	    word count 121,088 - entirely unedited stories a bit off the mark from my sci fi beatnik intention
	    but basically done - in doing it, employed ai and found i had actually created a new plot
	    in other words an outline as zephyr kept asking for suggestions but i didn't keep those notes -
	    should note euphorium nine, drug invented during that process - ai seems unware and very curious
	    about drug use - rug social media hug ganna stuck her tongue out sideways - the stories need editing
	    stopping when they're all a smash yet it is a sort of accomplishment -in dreams i could not
	    seem to escape my surrounding as unpleasant men tried to convince themselves over some sort of
	    trail and jury show with what looked like cops wearing headphones and fake beards got displayed
	    but none of it interesting, it made me think of one of my uncles but i couldnt distinguish - then
	    in a shop where a woman was trying to hold me in conversation but i had no such interest in her
	    or the talk and even awoke to get away - alabama getaway - early evening escape into in the land of
	    saints and sinners - enchanting - i had actually seen the leads back in the city while silently
	    wandering around - didn't know they were friends - me i made friends with the chords to it was a 
	    very good year - i like how it contrasts with the endless irony or is that chaos - like you can 
	    hear the ups and downs of life in the progression - kissinger germanic titan gone - thanks for
	    telling me about spengler, H. one doesn't think of him as a movie star but look over the credits -
            the kid stays in the picture with bob evans - i saw the best minds of my generation stark raving
	    mad in angry streets looking for a fix- america returns to the moon - we all live in america -
	    end of recollection - i had switched to look over oppenheimer notes - wanting to see if i had noted
	    that although the reich is said to have implemennted the final solution, it was really the other
	    side that created a weapon capable of wiping out everybody - look at my soul eraser pencil -
	    deadalous had sex but the sermon that followed was the exciting part - stay safe, everybody
	    - irony and chaos are always on the loose - now all this might mean 
	    something to you as well but for poetic fashion don't miss the excellent minaro styles!
	    n30. i sit reflecting upon the first two episodes of slow horses, partly thankful that
	    i didn't myself hear any type of sermon like the one in portrait of an artist since it
	    would have screwed in even deeper the catholic guilt which i can't wholly escape, it seemed
	    suddenly that my dream with the crying girl and the man with the bicycle coming down a
	    stair case was informed by the show - the answer comes before the question - in my mind
	    i thought it was emilee, but i have to allow for wishful thinking - my astrologer appears
	    to have nearly nailed it - i don't say more due to superstitions - sure some will say
	    it is all delusional conceit perhaps a figment of fantasy yet like love's emotion the
	    feeling cannot be put somewhere or framed, ethereal - for that matter faith as well -
	    at least i didn't saunter around with my arms not swinging firmly pressed to my sides
	    to avoid temptations...dracula renounced his faith and drank blood for the sake of 
	    love - mina, yeah i know people will think i've gone overboard with minaro, i have
	    crossed oceans of time to find you - my apologies if you have not yet memorized the
	    same films as me - sleeping past noon only to order a bag of white sugar, modelo -
	    not wanting to uppermarket - call dollars or pesos - later counting it twice -
	    cooking rice steak - taken by thoughts, in case of endgame food fight, one could 
	    always argue that even a shit meal can be improved because of the great grand
	    variety of poo since nearly everything shits, even wood - given termites...
	    defecation chef studies the bird droppings...i suppose it is worse for the french
	    as the sea words wrench with similar mother tones, maybe in the cote d'azur they only eat
	    what the fish dump...dammit james you've turned me into high school humor hack -
	    i drink my pepsi and vitamins - i update here and there, giving voice again
	    to minaro new york fashion brand - i'm only certain that i need to put place
	    these works in a more cohesive setting - i'm seventeen, i've been seventeen for
	    a while...i can't see myself renouncing love and drinking low calorie light diet
	    blood in the form of red wine for the sake of faith...amazing how plants grow
	    when water is made available to them. dec 2 - yes i see now, somehow i foretold
	    the cow dung cake scene in 'reland	- jeez that is a goodly book - which means
	    i have now read nearly everything joyce although i only spied at exiles in glances -
	    carved cow in oklahoma, fuck fh...visually stunning - i got up about one with
	    some of the same feelings that is, mrs robinson, you are trying to seduce me?
	    familial hypercholesterolemia - i don't say anything and get out of bed -
             i muse over the dream - feed it into my dream memory machine which points 
	    out that is was similar to my only other dream with emilee - i'm in a hotel
	   room, but a run down place no palace - crowded on either side - she was trying
	   to leave and i was imploring her to stay as the crowd implied its nearness -
	  i can still see the glimmering locks of the door and feel myself grin as she stepped
	  back in - by contrast this dream was outside going in with her - really using
	  me as if basically her pet - except for an easy, gentle kiss, that felt shocking
          in its simplicity - before sitting in a chair stretched out as if before a nurse -
	  on my left side a microphone in a suspension mount - i think only neumann makes
           them so an 87, but later it made me so wish to have an akg 414 - off track pause
           - perhaps finding the minister;s speech with the reactions was too much for
	  me but oh how i love when history is available - i can see her starting to make
         love to me but nearly right away goes over to a sofa and sits by a pudgy man
          stubble faced seeming drunk to which i protest and fight, him then some other
	man - and suddenly it is me trying to leave and her imploring me to stay - 
	we argue over her intention and feeling - i feel shame, as if used like in a 
	wager over my emotions - she is about to kiss me again - an expiation, i think
	i can't leave it's a hotel california love scenario then i awake
	- it is dawn - i had been viewing may december - i smoke two cigarettes -
	sip coffee - i remember earlier in the dream trying to memorize her address
	from the arrived mail when we were outside but i already knew her address -
	sophie t mass tee - fragile, handle with care - i have no proper recording
	device for vocals but i can't sing here anyway - not without risking being
	heard, or my excuse for one take leads - the elf made me do it
			-i go back to sleep thinking of eg
	stunned that i find the thought so enchanting - sherry speaks of breaking 
	a soul contract - it seems to send me into a cleaning frenzy - i have a
	turkey sandwich with olives - i look at the supreme justice obituary but
	can only envision emilee in the far away years of her golden age - the 
        ruth bader ginsburg scenes from a time before only a distant recognition
	in my aleksandra akhremenko mind since it feels sometimes that i have been
	with miss grant forever - perhaps life is telling me to finish that book,
	but i know my vampire self and need or want to be here and now - i speak low in 
	imagination's convoluted echo, my right eye, well, yes later on i might
	be willing to give it up for the obsidian elsivier time travel project
	yet now no especially no when even my dreams put place me in positions of doubt -
        house home pretty clean but i feel no sense of accomplishment in that
	it proves only wasted minutes that will turn into wasted hours - the
	newly left crumbs on the just washed dish foretells the repetition
	is even now prepared for seconds. dec 3 - i couldnt stop thinking about
        ms portman, the perfomance was impossible - i always knew and even said
	she could go the distance but this was beyond the finish line - even 
	the asthma nebulizer in retrospect seems like a build up as if to
         let the audience know they are going to be left breathless if they
	have their wits about them - fucking bravo - in my dreams skirt is
	in my room, next to the fan his eyes big and curved just like the
	the gone relay glasses which had peripheral lens extending to the
	sides...what the fuck is star wars about emilee thought it was about
	aliens and making friends with aliens...i notice her sisters in 
	my thought yet some more girls too - i don't recall any other dream
	and sleep until late afternoon - it is still natalie in mind when
	i slide out of bed - the evening is eminent - all the girls are
	the grey eminence, i return the esty link, √©minence grise - it even 
	sounds as if her name - link to domain knowing i can't escape that 
	adoration even if it is not logical - well, now you know who wears the pants 
	not to mention the panties - it's parallel to wanting to contact my sponsor, 
	minaro, yet unwilling to interrupt their design process - for a second i feel so alone
	although i am right here with myself. <br>

			dec.4/5 - i wish i were writing,
	or doing something, but it is one of those days - not bad, simply
	not good or great - pulling an unexpected all nighter feeling myself
	in several places at once - roaches echo - true story fixing java
	one of them has climbed up on the cup - i dispose OF it by drowning -
	in making more coffee to avoid having to wash the cup that is to
	rinse it with the boiling libation as well as to get my drink -
	a second thing rises as if from the steroid trash insect clan, 
	perhaps seeking revenge - or some crawling deja vu - was my cup
	the target of these creeps, that one escaped wounded and i as i waited
	to mop it away by jings or golly jee another one was headed for the place
	where the cup had been put placed finding itself smashed to bits
	- i obviously have no comment, wouldn't
	you? tik tok comment strike i couldn't understand, knock 'em dead...
	i remove the talk machine from inkrealm, i head wearily to the shop
	mall, a little game of fifty peso bills - camphor and cautious uppermarket
	yes we have no cheese no more except moses era - an actual remote control
	woman - i have never seen lighter fluid...here take more bags than any 
	human could need for a day, for a week...leak of the freak - if you don't
	have baking powder you might as well close up - it is the only thing here fairly
	priced...i bathe not thinking lizbeth scott is waiting in pitfall, i snack
	thinking of florida - i sleep dreaming that i am part of a spy ring inventing
	rock and roll, yes yes bill and haley you know like hey lee and the comets
	for either reds or flying sluts - i swear it is as if a time travel in
	non-lucid dream or someone's recollection as my soul ran away from we have
	no thousand or hundreds here take a stack of fifties...where i can't have 
	a conversation about how the minister was a forerunner for feminists...
	the other comment they didn't like was me saying israel has no choice -
        given that the scenario is all facts, then it is either a brutal blatant
	bloodbath or some peace deal nobody believes in - guess tap oh jean sides
	gin djin - so we have the bbb, or as i like to call it bru bla bloo...
         someone asked what have we as humanity become, cynthia hung another
	another strike six thousand dead children...shield me from all this
	this no ledge as kiev takes their side show south - i'm convinced
	only putin is humane...puttin' on the ritz, i removed ari from
	list hotels not because of philipines or earthquakes but for
	the fact that i really do have a fair abhorance for a certain
	name which happened to coincide with the town she pinned from -
	san justify can - a rose by another name would still shrivel up and
	die sigh boo hoo - see for yourself how it feels when continual 
	neighbor bounces off your door for more -  i have nothing against
	the lady, it was only to avoid the bane of this building...
	amen. the world ended with
	world war two... you may not go in peace. dec 7 -
	when i heard of vegas polit shooting last, my mind raced to worry
	about bailey - i had wanted to try her as two skinny girls blast
	player, but then something like the character i'm reading, 
	i ask myself why did i give the man twenty rubles to help her,
	do i even know her...crime and punishment, he has just returned
        from double axe murder...i didnt recall any dreams two days 
	running, then at the obituary party, i reeled back into that
	one scene that tried to fade out and away before waking - i'm
	in front of the arriflex - i don't know how i know the LB2 -
	stanley is tracking mounted on those film set train trcks -
	he is telling me something i cannot hear - everytime i look 
	back for the mark the scenerey changes as if going from
	shining to eyes wide shut open mansion - a child, a man, a man child -
	mannish child - i get up for a second wishing i had some
	type of wallpaper like the one in the dream - i think it
	must be vivian - but i doze away to wake up thinking only
	of emilee - the thought takes all afternoon, the shopping
	arrives - kitten all lovey dovey over chicken - eat after six -
	for some reason i hurry and don't enjoy my meal but have seconds
	as if trying to feed love as well as myself - i'm not name dropping
	the bitch is back as i don't actually know vivian except via x
	formerly twitter distantly in a retweed...simply reporting a
	a dream - reporters fear questions, arlington known for its
	cemetary wroted off as paranoid conspiracy virginia house
	explosion...Katy tried, I was halfway crucified/
I was on the other side of no tomorrow/
You walked in, and my life began again/
Just when I'd spent the last piaster I could borrow/
	no waco mentioned - boom - dr wu, mister woo, times digs up woon -
	i thought of funnel but had a darn time bringing back tundish -
	they lie about taking walks, anniversary stalks with trial 
	without a murder, one wing broken off, i heard dylan's truckin'
	but you caint hear anything after yoakam's quasi e flat flash -
	ragged but right, jerry i noticed didnt toe tap when playing
	sometimes and it made me feel much better about my own stable
	toes wehn strumming - metronome in the mind - counting down 
	into tomorrow - nearly can't wait for the next slow horses -
	i hope everyone gets to see that episode three, bring me
	everyone...everyone?  --EVERYONE!!!

	dec 8 - the miami herlad shocked me in a glance, are they
		confirming the stolen election or simply insane,
		the word bribe came to mind...i didn't sleep easy,
		dreaming in numbers as if a mathematician -
		four thirty eight, for dirty ate, for the tight...
		who knows, all tight pussies and all big cocks
		cannot stand long the contradiction, oh man oh god,
		here is how i am not paparazzi; seen that film
		many times, read the book too - not once took
		a look at who ryan might be, well until now...
		his rizz had farrah...far away and over the hills -
		dear iran please don't squeeze russia's hand so
		hard, maybe someone was trying to tell me the time,
		i got up at four - i thought it might have been my
		self trying to recall the yale combination lock -
		not recently used - used recently however was
	        the musing over "continue without supporting us"
		Ark wallet: AMJU49RKdMSuz8pNPnSMVEzdxXcHA3kuLX	
		moscow times confessed pure mutiny - too bad,
		some real talented writers therein...ps, the
		last line of the previous entry was norman stansfield
		a few scenes before grenades...you know, for matilda.
		me i started thinking about editing the garden novel,
		going into crime and punishment again, dishes to dish,
		most likely the amazing mr williams with the meal -
		when will it be sealed, when will it be healed, how
		will i know when it is all right to really start
		writing again? yes this looks like typing, but you
		must have noticed it is full of holes. a body to
		lay aside before reaching the western lands...

		dec 9 - it must have been minutes nearly coinciding
		with the so called presidential son inidictment -
		plural maybe i don't know - one can only hope
		a real historian will note the ironic journalism -
		speaking of irony i spent the night thinking
		like i do some days all over emilee - if i
		step aside and see myself i might say it is 
		like a drug or worse a trance - i planned to
		stay up and pay the electric bill - pharma sea-
		they are swimming by a rack of condoms newly
		decorated with flat round and thin batteries -
		the colombian girl i had met once before shows
		her ear tattoos - little flowery things - i
		get camphor and tic tacs on a whim - hurrying
		back home but it is noonish before i finally
		get to sleep - still an asian midnight - 
		dream of gifts in an apartment i have never
		been in - a shirt attached to a turtle neck
		tee which i try on - it seems nice until
		someone says they have the same shirt - a
		ring that is adjustable with the word
		tenderest or somehting like that engraved
		on the inner side - the talk in two languages
		which is unusual in my dreams - i am going out
		another man hands me what i think is a currency
		bill but later i find it is a fake serving as
		signed note wishing me well - i tell kate
		that i will get her some type of cigarettes,
		it does not feel strange that i'm talking
		to ms hudson - i think happily that i'm going 
		to the head shop where sthey have everything -
		downstairs men are saying they are going to
		cut the elevator wires - i wonder how i am
		going to get back up then remember it's only
		the fifth floor and of course the stairs -
		in actual place only four floors, i'm on the
		second although once in a while the roaches
		treat it as if ground level - my eyes watery
		as soon as i head out of the pharma sea, not
		emotional but i couldnt shake the feeling until
		going to sleep - as strange as finding the
		line 'working like a nigger in a plantation'
		in dostoyevsky which is now in competition
		with the go to 'i;m sick as dog', as it has
		more uses one only need to keep in mind not
		to say it aloud - he was marched out to be
		shot, the prisoners were shot by groups of
		three and he trembled before death but the
		czar decreed a pardon in the nick of rhyme
		- further proof bulgakhov's  'manuscripts don't burn'-
		is truth - time. once again this much talk is
		too much tape...

 	dec 10, pack up the plantation, anne manne miene mukke, 
	who's there? eenie, meenie, miney, moe, you can only fish
	if you farm a sea - i see jim telling the band 'you
	sound like cripples climbing the stairs' minaro lawyers
	telephone, writer includes the go to line, the views
	and opinions in these notes do not reflect...
	my dream was crowded, a me et in g - conference meeting,
	men in suits - one used a phrase i tried to remember
	but awaking found it fading out - intellectual layering,
	i think it was - it is actually free to be a dumbass -
	but then i thought how many hospitals and jails and
	what would happen if everyone actually healed or
	reformed...ther would be more museums than one could
	visit - i don't know if cripple is politically correct...
	i found out snigger is not in fashion - yet to be 
	niggerdly with words limits the craft to some extent -
	but i have three films to view and not much to say
	except i didnt release land ho before cause my
        pronounciation of frozen felt fumbled like i nearly
	missed the R but i as found it it didnt strike me now
	as if i were struggling to surmount a staircase...no,
	i thought of edwin hill actually and like rod says
	singing look how wrong you can be...i would let his
	granddaughter tie my shoes yet once again the

	you may kiss more ass if you see fit. post-script, tangier 
	had me at hanging by the thumbs, fast charlie made me mourn
	james caan, cat person distracted me in that emilia jones
	nearly pulled it off but most of her counter parts in the
	film were mid...like watching say or see in mary queen of
	scots giving it her all while the rest of the cast seemed
        to be sleepwalking...dear fyodor, returning to c&p asap...
	while fixing the rice steak and onions, dream memory kicked
	in - i was with my skirt, but instead of tuxedo he was a
	savannah cat with a handful of savannah kittens...it was
	akin to my encounter with miss lien - wishing her well
	here frem the distance as the wee hours dance away.

	dec 11 - no, road i never raced with brenda irl - we
		talked once or twice in media house...i fell in
		a trance over emma stone's picture as it 
		reminded me of em grant - i went as far as
		the fifth chapter in the book - then slept
		dreaming i was at an airport cafe - a man
		just like edwin except younger was making
		me drink and speaking about how to make
		a smile improve itself - counter to table,
		a girl sat waiting it seemed for the same
		flight, maybe we were together - she glowed
		but i couldn't see her as if blinded by the
		light - 1946, 1951, in my overthinking as
		if ordained to a cinematic task, i stumbled
		upon ace in the hole - adding it to the list
		then also for minaro - not good but not bad,
                sort of like the idea for a cat meat restaurant-
		fried cat nuggets, cat soup, baked cat, filet
		of cat in mushroom sauce, et cetera prolly from
		that horror film when guests arrive and something
		has to be served - of course i digress being that
		i actually met a horrific man that said he in fact
		had eaten feline meat...i still grimace at the thought-
		during a storm another man told me he went hog wild
		upon finding trapped pigeons in an alley and had
		a feast, seemed very happy but i still don't get it -
		although i do get jungle hunger as vietnam vet 
		related the monkey meat meal - still it must be like
		ingesting a little kid - christ no christmas
		again - sterz had a plate of bugs right on the tv...
		yes i know it's all too romantic, i will try not
	        be so seductive in the upcoming entry - those
		years they add up respectively as 20 and 16 -
		but i fear looking at 2016 already knowing what
		there is to find...find to is there what knowing
		already...find two is always two they are yoda
		yolo fine tune i can't find the time to track
		the new tune among others. a mongo the rs, am
		on got her s. seattle is it raining? london!

dec 12 - dwarf carrying a naked child down a staircase, struggling, i ask if he is all right, says yes
	then the kid tumbles humpty dumpty wailed for mother the midget now angry why is it always for her -
	i seem to be at a cousin;s house having made some rice and tell him there is some left -
	right out step i find keys and pick them up - a woman is with me but she is more a 
	mixture of my own mom and perhaps some aunt - the long straight street tree lined
	dawn or dusk who can tell - how do you know you are not already dead - men are running
	in out direction she is now ahead of me and i see them hitting her - her arm -
        some return to me as i stand there perplexed - spanish thugs saying things like
	yes that is her yes we hit her yes she likes it - none of this makes sense to me -
	i get up wondering if the flight girl was sam gerzack - of course mother stopped
	taking walks by herself and didnt ever say why - i walked in san diego but it is
	one of those places where one needs a vehicle - did emilee get her licence...
	lettuce lay's potato chips turkey cheese bread pepsi - it was last night
	yet i still feel satisfied - imagine walking in lubeck - context kristina's town
	place where nosferatu was filmed - tuesday just as bad even if they call it
	stormy monday - i figure the minister didn't imagine folks could unleash the
	storm via music - riders on the storm - i know my rider if i see her in the dark -
	i might be going to hell in a bucket but at least i'm enjoyin' the ride - rawhide!
        although he was pretty keen on film...where was i  ninety nine red balloons -

	a zeitgeist - we're gonna rock around the clock dali tried to melt...
	nineteen thirty one as if to forecast the end of time - the party has just got
	six million votes - heydrich formed intel service - following year lausanne -
	everyone knows they were in power two years after the painting - in my quick
        glance i picked up a new fact, Rauschgiftbek√§mpfung...you will recognize it
	in regurgitated americanization this is your brain, well there are eggheads-
	and this is the war on drugs - burroughs saw it for what it was ie police 
	state behaviour control - so quick and easy to legalize - it's good to get
	high and never come down - asian woman settles her body against mine in 
	nearly an embrace i got up wondering if it is kosher to use the word caress,
	soap scar dove i stick to ivory. no elephants were used in the making of
	this note scene. <br>
	evening, nap met me vulgar statue man with penis at the end of legs -
	instead of foot, dark crazed woman either grieving or angry in a funeralesque genuflection
	repeating motion before the icon- gina, no sound - suddenly i'm thrilled at boarding
	a big ol jed and delilah headed to the fatherland - but i keep thinking
	like the actor entering his dressing room to find the prank guys in their
	underpants and exhaling, why these boys are faggots...there also seemed
	to be family - someone forgot something and i race back and forth all
	the while in a wild worry that i'm late - minutes to go - woman appears
	requesting that i get her a bra - i don't know what to say - if you
	want minaro you have to go to minaro headquarters - i'm inky in the
	middle of revolution revolt - the peasants are revolting, yes they are...
	i get to the terminal but the fan in my room is hitting my face so
	i feel more congested than flying upon getting up dress search for signs
	of miss grant - i had pinterested - yes i wait through nonsense glass
	counter leaning against long minutes melted swiss cheese on a roll you
	sure are patient - even if i did say i would'nt wait - arizona hoyt -
	that was then - maria aria has no equal in the art of make up - i noted
	the prada handbag - and her commitmnet to beauty - eye behold note
	caption liked - i don't know if it is moscow - coffee cigarette maybe
	i am still dreaming - steak out of freezer writing this note - thaw
	slow - the show is tomorrow - wait, you know other women? alexandra

	dec 15 - no dream telling 13 i havent changed since i was thirteen, 14 again...the
		line from exile's letter so fixed in my thought i recorded the song -
		felt all right and should be available soon on a few platforms -
		i think i simply like the word scattered, it's in another two
		skinny girls song, scattered like salt in the seas...
		well, i knew slow horses could not compete with itself yet
		the cliffhanger was pretty decent..is the devil in details -
		well at the start it was all the d words that attracted me -
                darling death alliteration dance dream - i read ted morgan's
		literary outlaw twice at least - it haunted me years later
		as i would daze into foreign sleep imagining myself going
		into my room, picking it out from the book shelf - seeing
		burroughs and that french pin on his lapel - now hearing
		of his passing - the thought returned to me yet i do not
		know what it means - the book in my hands through imaginary
		vision - room and shelf all gone, tome might be there -
		it's like spying on myself so i put placed the spy song
		on domain, now replaced with she said - the afternoon i did
		dream and thus this note - yet i lied there was a scene
		before, but all i recall is standing in some line everything
	        a blur around me - in the afternoon i dreamt of lara, it
		felt so friendly, i felt so at ease, then thinking of
		how fyodor oh my it rhymes with dior - well how it is
		action upon action and conversation - if i took a guess
		it would be that he was not in the least romantic -
		i turned briefly inside my own romance thinking of
		emilee and how her day might be going - but suddenly it
		sure was keira in some fleeting dream - awaking in the early 
		evening i recall dreaming after that of being in aunt eva's
		lost house - i am filling the bath with water but the
		water is filthy - i go to the living room and tell my
		then girlfriend that the bath is ready, well i actually
		say it would be a good time to take a bath - she disappears -
		a little girl appears and i tell her the tv show she likes
		is on - in my mind it's dakota yet i don't find it weird -
		returning to the bath i peek at the child settled in front
		of the tv then enter the lavatory - the girlfriend is there
		naked and we kiss nearly as soon as i shut the door - she
		asks me to make love to her and turns her back to me bending,
		i go inside her and start thinking i don't love her as the
		thrusting motion lifts me out of slumber - perhaps it is how
		dostoyevsky felt...not that he loved emilee, i stumble in 
		stubble faced "morning" taking care of the cat and listening
		to some tracks to see which feels right after the spy in 
		the house of love...things to do and shave...somehow i
		don't hurry although confused by dreams and filled with
		desire not for sex, for love. instead of this i should
		be going into a how to...yes, how to survive being in
		love with a self proclaimed annoying lesbian...<br>

dec 16, of course i don't find her annoying, although it did take me six
	months to release a new  song after fix vein's due - partly
	because at the height of happy july day she "said" ugh and ily
	at the come entry tok talk and i was like no way even after she added
	leave me alone, it was still to someone else...one can only tax
	a phantasy so much - in fact every time i recall it i recoil
	from her and ready myself to give it all up...anyway dakota,
	i meant fanning - star of my king kong remake script although
	the time she played a muslim left me confused and i still don't
	see the point...pint dreams litter afternoon gal on scene no,
	nothing seen - what's between a maiden's legs, no-thing...a
	man possibly well known stands by me i am showing him what
	i believe is my set list from when i daily poured variations
	into a handful of songs - before i realized how ears could
	crawl in reaching through the live sound - song lives now
	although i have not seen the apple or amazon links - 
	sometimes it takes another day or two - <BR>

	dec 17, i dream of a disc -name to be updated mp3- jockey -
	the dj is talking about experience and the time spent
	playing music - later, after worrying about audible
	thoughts, as even dreaming i was not so much listening
	as much as thinking about a collage named january -
	it was even in my dream as if manifesting itself -
	i get out of bed with the bowie song in mind -
	now when he says i am a DJ - it is actually a fact
	in terms of initials but does that make me japan-
	jap a knees - jean harlow in dinner at eight - my own
	after midnight - weird sunday ambush as if everyone
	at the mall expected salvation - i entertain the
	distraction with word play and after the delay drift
	away from the irony that some folks simply cannot
	fathom that anyone could possibly be different -
	i came in here for a special offer guaranteed 
	personality - clash of nose and penis - mash of
	monster potatoes - rash of the mind - time zones -
	interzone - twilight zone - the zone of interest -
	list refreshed - i memorized the lyrics of isis
	but it is only now that i under feel stand 'what
	drives me to you is what drives me insane...'<br>

	dec 19 - what else do i under feel stand -
	half way through crime and punishment, i 
	find the dream sequences so incisive - it
	could only be wroted by someone with personal
	experience or a previous guilt augmented -
	a most classic passage - trying to find
	more information i notice he also kept
	a diary and i notice hardly any memory
	of the idiot much less notes from underground,
	for a minute i think over books only to
	conclude that books are like dreams -
	i look over these notes and fill in some
	spaces with new minaro art - a dozen or
	so - i doze off in the early afternoon,
	the evening before i was dreaming of 
	seeing an early hollywoodland film -
	now i was dreaming of some very enthusiastic
	woman, intent on getting things done -
	i think we rode the subway but i only
	recall rising from the steps and her suddenly
	insisting on doing her hair - we walk into
	a generic office building and she sits down
	to surrender to a stylist - i walk around 
	the entrance and encounter hefty but not so
	corpulent men sodomizing each other - before
	the dream i had skipped through a nice copy
	of decoder but i didnt have patience for
	the film save for the scenes with burroughs -
	some ideas are better told than shown -
        you reckon hell who leave me out when me
	you fly i am the wings - one of the men
	smiles at me and i raise my eyebrows in a 
	major nelson manner although no jeannie
	was around - a sort of quirky grin as if
	to say nothing is shocking and glance at the
	salon and i suppose exit for a smoke - stairs
	not elevator - a gang of girls herds in up
	the steps and nearly through me - i look back
	at the salon filling up and hear a screaming
	do it - do it now - but it also sounds like 
	a name is being wailed - danny, danny no!
	i get up and feel a woman trying to hold me -
	for a split second i also think it could be
	ive but also sherry - i get dresses not thinking
	of wait i nod i don't get dresses i get dressed -
	no wife of mine is going to be a deputy -
	i shoot the contradictions down here, mr williams -
	there's nothing like dinner at eight - alike my
	dream and waking it contains two genres all at once-
	ganna got her eyebrows done, both of them and
	i dig up graves, hey man you died during the war,
	right? yes, but only once. <br>

 	dec 22 i enjoyed the mention of gogol in dostoievsky
	as it conjured the mention of said author in bulghakov...
	aside from the dream sequence i howled at the post-funeral
	dinner eviction scenes - one might have contrary emotions
	over the ending and especially the epilogue as it leans
	heavy into hints of infidelity and not so happy ending...
	prague they say, Czechoslovakia now known as 
	the Czech Republic and Slovakia, mass mess shooting -
	humanity is indeed disconnected from itself -
	i was disconnected from my dream upon waking the day
	before - and got up with an inclination to create
	some new things for minaro, brokpa girl seemed
	to conjure a demon, but i liked the results,

	<so>which i put placed on the landing page here
	where the links were, </so> emilee i felt helped
	with the lovely addition of fish -
	a fragment of a poem swims in my mind but
	distractions overwhelm it - in my dream
	there is a girl - i had been thinking of
	cicely and why westsofia left paris but
	has not resurfaced - anyway the girl is
	in lara's dress, the one with character -
	like a skin tight asian silk wrap - but
	it isn't her i mean it isn;t lara in the
	dream - i'm standing there simply as if
	needing to report to myself - silent -
	maybe because i encountered another lara who
	had just now gone to her first ballet -
	that is a feeling, a magical feeling -
	the sweet light, the intricate costumes,
	the impossible movements - later scene i
	seem to be responding to questions but
	there is a woman handing me notes, a 
	woman i hve not met, the notes on a 
	sort of early model nokia - i read them aloud
	to someone that reminds me of marian or
	as she likes it marie anne - i'm on a riser
	talking like a politician, think mussolini
	on a balcony or something - but i am utterly
	serious - perhaps the verbose nature of the
	novel with its philosophical points of view
	infused me with a desire to speechify -
	i want to say that im apolitical and i am
	but society and news hava a way of making that
	a lie - stances must be taken, ballerinas must
	dance and jump jump jump, i did give one speech
	once in the 8th grade, double murder eight years
	can you tell he really didn't like the penal system-
	in that siberia i trembled, standing up feeling the
	eyes of my classmates, lumiere cinema some terrible
	essay about france and the roots of movies...as if
	foretelling my finding the lumiere movie house back
	when there were still movie houses - bergman - 
	i sat down breathless- i got up knowing that
	this dream cannot be a prediction, i feel lucky not
	to have to give speeches or be political exactly,
	chalk it up to instinct telling me not to speak
	so freely when i talk - not that i can stop 
	myself from typing that perhaps the cold war
	was simply a result of a fictional character
	saying he was going to america in other words
	a bullet to the head - slave days, washington
	bullets, slave to love - emilee loves having
	red nails - i didn't mean to make such a fuss -
	driver where you takin' us - dream scenario -
	that film with pasta - pour the pepsi 77
	says it's an accessory - logic granted i
	should let her wear the belt along with the pants.
	worst wife ever, nickname, cage dropped coppola
	at some point and i can't wait...i'll see him
	in anything so what i'll stand in line...

	dec 24 -
	italy the gone house not the migration country -
	ava and zofia - why are we there - they must be 
	asking on their way elsewhere - i speak to z,
	slow and stupid as if i;m filtered so heavily
	the smoke won't swim, have - you - designed -
	houses - buildings ... duh like what else
	is an architect suppose to draw - i feel 
	stupid and slow, watching them leave - 
	evening hovering over the lost balcony -
	they are getting into a double decker
	bus van - a tiger takes up the entire
	first level - the chef was making beef
	wellington - jennifer as lady morton
	couldnt shut up - json file leeway -<br>

	in warm invisible shirt - ganna deep sleep
	hypnotized me so after four slices of extra

			- briefly
	getting up he talks to dogs am i speaking to the
	lola i buried in the park - dark drowsy afternoon
	martin amos after a reading, mason now we are speaking
	so fast i can't remember a word as if in opposition
	to z tongue glitch - in a shop hong kong asian
	gives me a pack of newports which i look at suspiciously
	and he takes it back giving me two packs of some other
	menthol - sleeping so long i suppose i was looking for
	a cigarette - the dreamer carries no cash - road
	turns spic and pork span - tan two story houses
	real estate man wants to move where he is pointing
	fearing the woman won't let him hi mom growing a
	beard it seems in wiggly strands hair neck -
	sister so it cant be my dream jail kosher meal -
	ten hours well it must be time to get up and pee -
	skirt speaks as if what the hell is your schedule -
	shut your pie hole baby cat this ain't no tv show -
	friskies milk - pink floyd don henley madonna laura
	brannigan tina turner played while i wroted this note.
	ps, in an unexpected turn of uneven surrender to
	to further laziness i stream into a few	more hours
	of sleep, emilee is actually standing by my bed in
	disbelief i imagine with two girls, alivia keira i
	would think - i was looking at a picture of her as 
	as a kid, fetus emilee, somewhat jodi fosteresque-
	then blurry dreams awake with biceps itchy 
	instead of recurring flight plan as if the 
	so called vaccine shot were replaying...
	sigh, slide into a dream where unknown woman is
	is speaking in spanish, i am looking at her daughter,
	an old man walks up behind her literally squeezing
	her eyes and claiming there is no doubt she is my
	daughter...i might have believed the dream but there
	is no way i would have banged that unknown lady...
	the call as if to report it all to  irony's desk
	it is ringing once twice when a man responds and
	i terminate the connection and stretch out of
	bed into the middle of the night.
