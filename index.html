(an unedited novel, wroted 2021 ¬©Ô∏è 2023)

   by inkrealm -www.inkrealm.info

i first met the white cat in passing, that is, it was passing along the sidewalk there at throwing distance from my apartment's front porch or main bedroom windows...

i could sense a vague conversation yet told the feline to hold on a second while i picked up a treat from the ice box. 

upon my return, i found it had waited...so much wiser than the kittens, they were new and hardly stopped to listen...

yesterday or the day before, i encountered it as i ventured out to dispose of trash...we greeted each other both perhaps apprehensive and i thought similar thoughts as on the occasion in which the waiting was resolved...

returning with a wild catch tuna can, it seemed anxious yet too polite to near...

i gave it some and left the rest at the the cat's discretion...

the devoured contents explained to me that it had been a goodly meal...that is, when i sauntered thataway for cigarettes...

having purchased the smokes, i was terribly surprised to find the cat so grateful that it greeted my arrival with quick happy gestures...

i grinned at the entrance and wished it well...

in my dream the russian girl removed my glasses at the library where we sat...it was the first dream i could recall in some many days...

this despite the fact of being as they say clean and sober...

2.

pull, the word wrote itself as i plugged in the keyboard to write at the drizzle of dawn...

i had dreamt pretty clearly of jasmin in conversation, near enough to study her lips...i remember asking about fashion and i remember a sort of surreal transition of her within a frying pan...

of course i awoke to wonder, the likel;y conclusion of an imposter seemed reasonable....just like the russian girl either alina or zlata as in fact the have very similar faces yet in either case an element of control hovered over the sensations as if someone pretended to be someone else...

more so with alina than zlata, to be vaguely clear....

i went back to sleep, soundly and secure and in the knowledge that i had imagined writing a short story...when he squeezed the crazy glue tube it squirted along his right eyelid which mnade him scramble for all sorts of things before realizing there was no time and with his remainging peeper he placed a call for help...

there are two versions, the other is an intentional pouringo f glue over a sleeper...

now then, the pull, as it were is misplaced, that is to say i have already written more perhaps than i could ever edit especially after the last novel...

what is this, then? a fair and good qustion yet one that will only reveal an answer as it will...

in dreams, it was maria that came to me yet neither maria aria nor maria neverova...as if to prove that the hours are only what we make of them, it was maria baez...

not that i mind, still, it is unusual and i suspect it stems from the same source well let us call it manipulation.

3. 

Yes obviously not pill pulled from thin air, but some sort of hovered touch spelled it as if magically or invisibly...

pulling at my dream, i find myself in a low lit bar the longer lonely types one might find in expensive hotels, there is a woman there and while i am standing as asexual as a tree she performs oral sex upon me yet my thoughts are about adjusting some parts of my body as if highly aware or distracted by possible onlookers...

Sunday had been the longest hours of any day that i had ever lived...i attempted several distractions without any luck or resolution finally judged myself heartbroken at the perhaps unfinished task of art pieces i had been in the process of creating...

of course i had completed well over six hundred prints but there was a novel which i longed to continue yet the muse took me in other directions  until even the unconditional love diminished itself to well let us see what happens next...

nothing happens, she gets thrown backwards onto a bed for kicks and mentions snow white...

pig intestines are thrown in the parliament...

people pretend to enjoy a puzzle as a movie but this only used to work with lynch in those dreamy scenes...

invented - inverted - i liked industry...

except at episode eight - the end - i had convinced myself somehow that another episode followed and was left a touch dazed...

where was i yes the muse well doubly dazed...amazed wherein once it was in awe now as confusion...

4.

the chaos races through my dreams, a blur of dread and desire...

i stand on a road of semi roasted pigs, all of them similar faced nearly alike the dying woman downstairs...

i am too far in to head back and cannot see the end of the road...

despair awakes me, another dream twice shot by spic cops in tge abdomen...

the worry that is recurring...

dreaming or awake, the muse returns to me...over and over as if in possession of my imagination...

down the street from columbia dorms across from barnard, in the unintentional app of the nap a group of people in a car parked i stand in gestures as she nears i am aware of being watched from an adjacent distance still i carry on as if only she existed until crashing down gently at her half embrace upon the pavement her hand pressing at the area between pocket and zipper...her kiss like some sort of lightning that awakes me...

i get up, the memory of the recent black cat left outside as if not visible to the nearby cvs guard on the asphalt trampled again and again by passing cars after dawns eerie light...

who could stand there supposedly to protect and disregard a dead kitten...

it rained, that night, and it was still raining when the white cat strolled by and i caught a glimpse, racing to give it turkey yet it was already wet and wanted the shelter of at least some makeshift umbrella...or perhaps itself upset over that loss...

each cat is unique in personality and conversation....although like God some do not speak...

we will catch each other anothet time perhaps when i figure out what this book is about...

so yes prelude or introduction...

5.

The whole day at work, Roy, with his wrinkled clothes and greasy hair, could only think of getting home, getting home and into bed.

into bed, not for dreams, but to masturbate.

6. 

While Roy might be a way to start, I argue with myself...Why fiction...for some profit...for to follow rules...dead black bears in the Jersey woods...hunting seasonings...no, I will not fiction here...slowly, with ten new euros, i will write as i feel it should be done...what key is that song in? key of me...

cat across the street i glimpse glance right after muse posted kittens...a slice of turkey and another then one more...

my panties match my dress said the thin tall vixen at the milk aisle...parmalat...yesterday was a water heater action packed fiction on itself up the stairs down the stairs...

melrose boulevard to amsterdam avenue...

how to open coconut in notnutnovember..

i do not actually know what roy does, i do know the president elect is making promises...

not one pussy grabbed, tagline for the last days of this administration...

not one vote rigged in mass hypnosis hoopla nonsense hype...

all this racism and sexism yeah let us vote for an even older whiter groper...

ho bid en...no coincidence book release best seller bullshit talk show circuit trash flash back historians hard at work on the cover up...

suddenly vaccine...why arent more people vomiting at this mask of freedom...

Nihilism, perhaps. 

??? how well timed, tho... makes one nearly want to believe...but in what exactly ???

the danger of truth, plain talk, no golf course...

well some people feel like it is a victory  - i feel like i cannot even write these words...

an opinion like a pregnant picture of the former first lady is preposterous...

an opinion, intelligent or not is now a risk, a gamble, possibly a death sentence...

this prepaid packaged propaganda is made possible by grants from your compliance...

but me i refuse to play along, i will not spread your lies among children...

dicks out for harambe...

yet what is the truth of this drawn out and quartered election...

and does it mean that nasa is not going back to the moon under pence prayers...

lookit we are all each of us working hard to make the fraud a sort of saviour miracle worker...

the  nation should feel like smart not get but elizabeth nine months in psycho psuedo abduction marriage except for america and other places it will be a much longer time frame...

i will so miss having a first lady with actual style and decency...you may of course argue over the beauty part...

alone with the christmas tree weighed by cut tail clydesdale  horses and marines, i would say she looked pretty...

joe and jill went up the hill filled with that pill still holding up the fake promises of fill in the blank...

not one solid voice of dissent. land of the what?

home of the...

made in china.

i  am not political, yet the insult to logic feels personal. not we the people but some sort of soros fueled hollywood fake happy ending with everlasting credits...

maid inches in on the stairs, another player in the corruption that is nearer to my reality...

i  am invisible in a puff of smoke, floating, gone.

building "administration" attempted to buy their way in to here...into my hum yet numb from trying to stitch together the news i felt the intrusion...when someone goes as far as changing their name it can only mean a vile intent with the exception of the arts...

the boots that were made for walking, the inner workings of no more mystery than vulgarity

i am invisible in a pulling away from what is not love...

i make love to maria yet always thinking of the muse...

a failure at fantasy...a wreck at embrace.

7.

dream of flesh, soft white fat...viewed sputnik...reminded of the typewriter slash creature in a cronenberg film and colin...

coins, like email contrasted head of ripple...

space balls...all right maybe they are fighting aliens, have been since the ovens...

ahem...two candid eights went into election and three returned...

i want to yes i want to believe in the god we trust american dream mescaline fourth of july...

and maybe there is no cover up conspiracy and i have simply spent too much time ah lone...

but then i ask why didnt hillary re-run....

not to stun yet it is a tell tale signal...

this is a mans world or something like that, you can come to your own conclusions...

i decide for the split...

two sides one well it is what it is and the other it is a lie so juicy that no one outside of reddit wants to you tube it...

tranny joan death, is it meant to give me pause...light gay torture and mucus fight, is it dem or alien being quasi sentient....

a hot shower my first at home in three years...

the white cat had my left over steak and a slice of turkey, i took a picture...

i thought of the muse  (as pretend editors offer the word latinx instead of spic but they are both gender nuetral...as if there might be more than two...) as do girls attempted temptation..

(the thought arrives from transgender news...but if you cannot see the first world aspect of it you will miss my point...nobody in the worldwide struggle to survive, alike the animal jungle kingdom, has got the time or inclination to question their identity, they are hungry and they are coming for us, usa)

every day and in every way...

they will of course take parts of europe first...

imagine the surprise when you have to explain that pussy grabbin was only locker room talk..

tourists at a partly finished wall, she was not a cockroach folks crawling through the other side...

i told someone recently that everything in fact matters yet i wonder how much and exactly which higher power...

music? dont ya wanna go down like some junkie cosmonaut.

Anne memorial vandalized with Nazi stickers in Idaho...frank, we are evrrywhere...

moscow...

the long dark night hallway of half hidden stars roadway like a dream...

a sink full of mucus, reprise, two shot sounded fixture disjointed pop pop explosion under hot water...

ghost of winston ono

elephants at dawn...oh no, we didnt make it

...

circus circuits...another story another time

reprise...conversations need definition, context.

hardly slept for thinking of her, awoke early feeling her call...the dream bitcoin told a price, but the day is early...

horse bites off nose like time magazine person of the yearning award...all you gotta do is invent a pandemic and run for office with the antidote in your pocket...

friday, fucking friday...

three onions, i recall being moved from invisible browser to strong vpn, no vote...

yet finally a nap wherein the muse was in my living room glowing, thin, floating...

her sister in the balcony a hint of cleavage in her a cup i got up thinking it must be a future dream as her sibling is still only a child...

new yorker cartoonist caught with child porn...

they never say if it is a seven year old or a seventeen year old...

credit  card corp acting surprised over questionable content on porn hubba hubba...

it has to mean something else...

back in my room my aunt is leaving and i reach for her...

i get up happy to have the house to myself for a while...organize the closet clothes and shoes...

taking out the trash feels like packaged theater, a slim crowd, a woman screaming, newspapers on an otherwise tranquil plant, raw corn on the curb, bills atop the electric box, water on the hallway floor...i can feel the expectation of a reaction, but i dont get it, why would i even think of them...

death row concert, two skinny girls got another single out...

i am all for ending the life of certain scum bags...

switched ringtone from the korean film quote to fourteen hours and twelve minutes...

five piece kfc, ha nuke ah, the insect gimmick arrived from murder news report not franz...

roach is so also the remnant of a so called joint also slang for jail...

turns your smoking thumb yellow if you go at it for a whole while...

three breakers dedicated to a couple of suspicious outlets and two bulbs...i shut them off, i feel good over the action...

like a dancer gliding into simplicity:

Sara Leland, Ballerina of Passion and Abandon, Dies at seventy nine notes the obituary six days after the fact...

memories and thoughts of the ballet seem to stream within without reason...

no reason...while "writing" the canadian girl of lost elephant lore wrote me, perhaps that is the reason...same sort of inner details as if given in case the composition goes this way or that...

so while regret is too strong a word, i do wish to have been there as the elephants crossed the bridge into citys dawn...

of course, not as much as wanting to finish in fine form my previous manuscript...

some cook some do not cook, some things cannot be altered...

yet there is a hint of a sensation, a nearly clandestine tickle that tells me she wants it to continue...

how wonderful if it were so...

here the necessary fade to everly brothers all i have to do is dream...

i pray to lauren after her gromley gone our lady and saint pat knock on a door in glasgow...

on the heels of gemini, it seems some sort of gee alliteration is in order...

making a profit already if the deal went down...

sign up and they welcome me only a few degrees warmer than volgograd yet it feels like summer as i dream unsteady instead of earthy emma and i engaged in what can only be called hard sex...

nobody should view porn as it makes it seem there is a standard blow job to hump in ay least two positions and cum shot...

of cpurse with tantra one never knows if one is dying or just... 

it was st ives apricot scrub in the sink...

head pounding like a migrain from testicle pressure, ahem, nose clogged like a dead crocodile in florida swamp, anus twisted yet rarely all conditions at once upon a time hallucigenic psychodelic vision in one eye electric with no sign of busi...

pussy, so is it only marriage union that lauren wants...says she will fail her ex am today...

i am excited confused...what if i missed the point for sex...

it was never about sex my funeral plan maybe flowers...

it is a different type of love, but what could it mean or did some false con mix her up...

pfizer...campaign contribution profit...my macdonalds order five packs of french fries...

potato overload...there is no way to be myself, to be yourself while giving away heart full of soul...

i throw the white cat a whole piece of chicken, slides hides under vehicle before i can cell phone camera later on one of the black cats crouches as if to imply beatific cat jealousy...

later in the dream someone switched the neck of my guitar, top side warped, i argue with mother, i worry...well, if you insist, spix could be an option although it always sounds plural...

Country superstar Charley Pride dies aged eighty six...

Charlie.Red.Fuckable.Arrangements.XXX...

open in tor...

i look into making a tor site, half the told links they tell are gone...used to be an instant easy app, now removed from play store, the apk worked...for a while...

oh pen in torrent, im thinking of drew barrymore no relation to political cover ups..

perhaps it is tje mention of testicles...

hang down yer head tom delay...

and then lance in a glance...

pundi x and the uneven evil token coins taken as i stand still collecting for the girls i love and their future daughters...

as the earthquake hits chechnya and fiji, i start with dash...

oh the excitement by candlelit mining only to find it was not digital cash but the now untracked listing dashcoin...

or the quick gains while re watching ladybird...

evil web lies, of course you would perhaps call it greed if you doa didnt know me...

hmm shout out to a warning voice yet i only started hearing when they actually went into venezuela like a bribe bait offer of solution or should that be salvation...either or, it should not be done...

sure i suspected upon the uneven and strange desktop wallet which basically forces you to go with the mobile but those scenes preying upon the desperate, yeah exactly...

heave ho i am actually glad af they refused to give me a master node...

the only loss other than time was that two dollar paid to always in development quoinpro app for same coin...said coin, sad coin...

privacy sell out for placement...

evolution of the currencies takes time or bloodshed...

as i pondered the weirdness, i dreamt an empty six pack of whiskey which turned into a colorful closet and a dead man at the door...

like tits in disney movie, pundi x was really exciting and seemingly generous until it wasnt.

from day one i tried without success for verification then after a year or was it two the mechanism shut down for failure to kyc...oh there was a few months prior of loss of daily claim reward which they slowly fixed then promised to return eventually...but i aint the only one burned by the scheme as i found replica after repliclant in play store talk...

cannot log in due to kyc and cant kyc due to an update that logged everybody out....

now how to skip the countless online cloud miners that have vanished into an air so thin one gets papercuts out of the blue and simply ask why on earth would folks fix it so? 

all the way back direct to xapo faucets...

the dying breed the wallet itself turning into self proclaimed bank...

perhaps from transactions they pocketed to cover the cost of transaction...

ps, fees can change at their whim as i was told when it happened to me as i moved it all to coinbase only to be kept waiting at the miss out end of the earn program except for one coin...

so yeah left nothing but ukraine cents at xapo and little as possible at coinbase both owned by themselves now....

the most bizarre story in this journey which contrary to this thread has seen some profit, 

well wait there are two, eobot, after months of building it up my miner dropped that version leaving me with the lesser degree drip down and no faucet...

for historians there was an eobot v2 which faked it for reasons yet unexplained...

so much data swirling in head i actually forgot the second part of this paragraph twice, oh yeah nice hash...had it all working wide awake on bitcoin groove for a week maybe more when suddenly down came the possible fake news of missing funds et cetera site shut down app updated to something that would not work on my os when the dust settled...

these are the lyrics to its a long way to the top if you wanna rock and roll...

an eerily similar situation arose with safex...they switched mining methods as i was about to cash in and suddenly the end...

coinomi you notice does not delist itself...

in conclusion, avoid password managers specifically avira...i had used it years and then whem finally blockchain gave me some stellar part of which is now in limbo from transfer to astral wallet hello we must be going well i set the ps unworried then avira upgraded my account only to delete all the saved log ins when the upgrade trial period expired, but at least it proves why we dont need fiction at this point...stranger than yes no we caint do nothing im terms of a reset even if all your other info is in place, kick scream, seed phrase hell...

somewhere down the line i will make mention of the saints that have led to salvation...

for now let us note mass mutuals one hundred million dollar investment for btc...

whoa - the future nears...

let us wait until we no longer need to lick a stamp from leather billfold to mail a payment and count the change...

it wont be mansions, ladies...

i dream of the muse as if real, the russian cold even reflected upon the fragile sensation between my nostrils...

i awake without details like much of my minimalist prose...just the facts, maam...

well, i guess it is like the pee stain on the pants in the hunger you might miss and perhaps not necessary yet so juicy to catch...

cat not seen in several days...yesterday a grey cat that reminded me of shimmer crawled by with a wanting singsong yet i could not write with a mind filled with spicorama bla bla bla...

later one of the dark cat kittens loitered and ran off crazy legged when i deposited a slice of turkey...the slice itself blanketed his stride and split in the middle of the road i watched while he had the half grub in corner shadows then rambled back searching for more to devour the left behind portion in gulps undet my  window as the grey cat eased in and they greeted each other without hesitation...

but last night the white cat called on me nearly by name and i rushed out with steak and she raced up to me positively without hesitation then as if realizing her impulsive move bit and ran back to a more distant protocol returning after my exit for the rest of the meal her tail curved in a grin...

i end up with 0.1930568 or some such number expecting to pay a fee of 0.00015 or thereabouts but mind you the price is 0.4 us cents....

three verge, some ripple and tezos, same amount as stratis or more in tron, heightening gains in monero, zcash, bitcoin cash, nano, zcore, zen, doge, runebase and some few others at the exchange along with a couple of airdrops on the way...

possibly or most likely a productive moment not to mention the bitcoin to be counted...

i can sense the biographer pen, he always did tend towards a coin collection and this seemed to fuel his interest in new currencies...

i throw out the remains of the mirror i had perhaps thought to convert...

the white cat is waiting, half way through the door as i approach...

she loves me yet still retains her majestic composure, distance...

three slices of turkey...

somehow i scratched my arm, thought of the devils nickname...

dawn dream on top of a sensual woman as if in a relationship if intimacy...

there is a sliding tinted window...i am inside her yet working on closing the contraption as people are visibly stepping through the other side as it shuts i feel her sexual pleasure and get up from the dream with a weird sense of accomplishment and perhaps the need to find her for she felt as no other dream had...

the lyrics...got that lust in front of her its right behind...resound in my thoughts...

i think it might be an actress yet the muse also comes to mind along with that evil door dream...

not of the song but of recent art...

it is early and i return to dreams...sonya by now back in pinsk...minsk looked desolate and cold...happy for her return...

i am sold on an idea to hold these currencies and possibly proven right at least today as a few prices soared...

meanwhile staking...

i try out telling the story to see how it will sound,,,

sounds of sunday visit, haunting, distracting, i do not get it as certain as you do not get the part of this earlier chapter exhaling hatred...well, i do not want to explore beyond the point but there should be some subtance for justificatiion...obviously everyone is going to die, expire...eventually and so the meaning is intended in the immediate not the next in line as it were...and well when you hound someone for no reason then this sort of amoral bloodlust arises even without propaganda...

properly gaind some other coins other getting nearer...

postponed it seemed in dreams for another argument of mortgage and me well no wonder there are so few bridal shower pictures...

for the record, i nearly firmly believe some of these marriages near to me are are pure sham yes the flim flam of a fancy betrayal but intended to what?

there is talk like a small yell of the creation of a monster and i awake...

now i have done a lot, gone the distance as it were or even werewolf of london in a series of dreams but i have not finished harlots ghost,,,,

it's just that it feels that it is a crucial time for some of these currencies and getting into position will maybe ease a lot more time for reading down the line...

line the down, way back somewhere herein i had mentioned some scattered and even divided thoughts on subjects political and i wanted to or want to also put place a sort of book end (oh my how the blankenstein suddenly disappears) ahem harrumph whatever, lookit a lot of people i admire do not hide the fact that they are all for the return of democrats even a fractured footed groper that is when not in bernie camp site socialism sanders not madoff...which is to say i might be wearing my doubt a bit too tightly...but still, without actually going back and reading within these pages, i feel curiously satisfied in what i have stated...now in the shadows i feel the chase of the laughingstock gag but i am not afraid of such antics i went to high school in the states - if someone can take such effort to try and underline a threat well then it only proves me well not me but my writing right.

right in, ride in on a two thousand dollar check everybody thinks they are already going to get except me and sveta...

still, in general or overall i do think despite the foolishness that the invisible government is trying to keep it all from chaos...

to maintain order...not that i am going to go along with it but i can sort of see a workable theory within that context...

yeah yeah i know it's too much it;s as troublesome as aliens to religion....

not my fault. i am here on business, my own business and as many girls as i can save via literature poetry art and the variations of those seven notes we call music...

had you asked me i would have told you what i thought even before reddit youtube -

now i am not free or far enough away from sunday visit to have it as i want it but by jings i am getting there.

junky echo joke, i smell oil like from a deep fry contraption that should be changed and blurt out that i have been transposed to kfc where i had recently called for an order...hours and a day pass until that sniff of underarm...it's you bill you are the odor...

going to soap up now since the SV insisted on crowding into the shower room for a meeting discussion thus making it a memory of them instead of a simple water closet. 

hopefully i will find some way to reverse that unpleasant scene. 

like clowns in a volkswagon as i tried to hold my ground. 

x3

a man is signing papers, seems to be a cousin...but he is using the middleton name as in the harlow movie, hmm...

i am in a meeting, newsroom barricaded...the post, a tube of glue i get some of the liquid on my lips...the feeling is as exact as one might imagine...i circle the table avoiding glances at the men surrounding it...i can hear the hoi polloi in the corridor and think with this flimsy set up anybody could break through...it is a ply wood slab pressed up against an unlocked door...

in the movie luna wedler turns into a fish or perhaps a mermaid...mia...

it is disturbing...like the russian plot that keeps on rising in the background of my thoughts or what type of secret agent would stay on a landline for an hour...

mia aim, palindrome...the da a d away from fa fa father unicode yes...

a stray voice says they have been existing in england for several years now...

i get up to start a miner...my fantasy crowded yet i could not as always say if it was me or ego or them gem oral sex rem floral ex...

like a hookup funeral yet decidedly eastern european...

six thirty i contemplate staying awake.

dawn wells died...a three hour cruise...

i have the castaway feeling, morning side,

rock climb wall crumble...

highlander echo ima man not a fish...

twenty two gunned down at the airport...

aden...how does the year end, witha bang...

dawn wells goddess, i should be gloomy but i am not as she is immortal....

mary ann...i buy cannabis stock...

the washington post termed her wholesome...

i think they both were...

back to the dream, perhaps the ghost manuscript is calling me...

x4

not the manuscript but the man, mailer, burning as it were in tears...

i tried speaking to him but he was out of sorts well not bad for a dead man but still piss drunk literally...

now i know what she meant by the circus...

sudden memory of her hands...

i awoke to what would be the worst new years eve in memory...

except that i sort of heard from a model in beijing...

more on this later...

x5

one,month and one week and one day later it is the, 8 in february...

i find myself in oops possession of more  data than should be legal...

sorry im not sorry, i set myself not to learn but to earn...

i cannot however brag at the gains within that time period but there is a much wanted portion of cloak i now own and periodically my determination was proven more than timely, indeed nearly clairvoyant.

some coins rose as if claiming their rightful place of worth...

it was historic and it is not over.

however, without writing i am not truly myself.

a word now is needed i feel in terms of that hateful sentiment which to some might seem immature or vengeful...

i swear it is  neither although revenge is not without merit...

ahem hiroshima nagasaki, well, language is that virus...

how to put place it, they were rude and unkind and i was wronged and without reason which led to the trauma still spilling out upon these pages -

seeing them the other day i was panic stricken incapable of telling what i had upon my person and turned back for a lighter all ready in my pocket...

it had been a year since i saw faviola who wore a white pearl bracelet on her left wrist...

spending the night together we hardly spoke and the spook of the intrusive patrol was swept away in the near nearness of her...

perhaps that says something more than i can in wishing them exterminated, these hours given to us  cannot afford such weight upon their shoulders...

all the shouting amounts to an equal silence in the grave...

well until we find a screaming ghost...

host of another day another dream_ 

toast with the old bag, she is beautiful and we are speaking like a water cooler couple sitting down office style until some other man settles down next to us and i race away into a red and white room but she is racing behind me, speaks so directly to mother that mother disappears then she mounts me muses away my hair from my face saying you're not bad and i try to hide my smile but she kisses me as i graze her hip with my right hand awaking...

there is snow in long island shultz has just died...kansas city threw away the superbowl literally...miley was in concert...

i had done three versions of sweet sixteen before anyone could say too much and i did them in the usual style that is as improvisations even my fingers hurt as i had not practiced played in months...

vasilisa, naya, maria...never had i been so in the moment at birthday celebrations...

idea run at arm, the second one excluded,

gee i had wanted to wroted her every august twenty first...

in any case, aside from the bit of cloak, i made gains in zcore zen and zcash, some of the zec still pending in payout...

let me back track, at the start of my journey coinbase refused to pay me twenty five cents in  bitcoin cash and it made me anxious enough to attempt paying for some coins,

i invested reluctantly in fan tokens and my hesitation turned to worry when four euros became three and nearly two...

i also invested in mycointainer but later found they required ten or a hundred times more in order to withdraw and pleaded to get pulled out which happen3d or is happening with most of my deposits but neither the rapids they so eagerly give at entrance nor any other currencies gained while staking as well as the nine dollar subscription fee -

luckily offset by ten plus dollars in cloud mining...

why obviously the tide was turning...

still in the investment department, it was looking gloomy and to add to a sense of doom a gemini purchase of kyber dragged on until i gave up...

presently, the saved coins are doing all right some of them even earning interest, knc albeit a lesser amount was purchased from tezos holdings...

ah yeah, the fan tokens looks set to climb...

my worry as when an etc transaction went obliterated eased while confidence flourished...

to be perfectly clear, mostly i am speaking in cents, pennies from heaven, claimed through so called faucet work...rip moon bit bonus fun coinpot buried february now...

yet the sense is as follows, my eighty or so verge is now above a dollar as is my little binance assortment...

and the reasoning is to leave some "thing" to those girls i consider as near to me as closeness allows...

by that time these portfolios might well balance their wishes as they fortify my testament...

writing down the word seeds, i think of how it will go down...

if you have never set down thirty twelve and twenty four sets of words for nmemonic discovery then you cannot understand my paternal emotion in glee to think this or that might give these women financial freedom or even further away for their own daughters...

once in a while, as i look at the number 36677 as the number of claims at one place, i feel lucky in a foolish way...who knew i had holdings in btcpop that had grown over time and walking in already found gain...

a gain that reinforced what i call my pen wallet...which i intend to leave to jennifer...

let us see, stakecube is growing freely but i have yet to decipher the how and when of that platform although yes i did transfer with success xp coins for scc...

funny huh we are scc however we have no scc in our faucet...

meanwhile scarlet either left or was fired, replaced by daniela...

i scramble to see if perhaps i can seduce her if only to further the jealous fury within faviola...

but allow me to conclude this disjointed section with a bit more on coin...

i lament slightly not having enough inclination to invest at the point of excitement...i knew somehow that kyber and komodo would turn a profit and was proven quickly correct as one jumped to a couple of dollars from 0.9 cents or so and the other is on an upward rampage...

meaning a million could easily become two, but i dont mean this as any sort of economic advise, simply thinking out loud as it were...

you will notice i have not used the phrase all time high, the reason if not obvious should be...

to shake it, we know what we are yet not what we may become...

the only insight i have learned is that when eth rises it sure as shit maintains that level...

even on sundays when it seems a whole lot of traders go for broke and bitcoin bottoms out as if a few thousand were now a natural transition...

so what do i have, i have some, not enough to brag but possibly enough to hope that down the line them that are mine will not want for a means to survive...

other wise, ravens, pivx which has one of the nicest wallets around, redd, btt which i do not undrtstand but has shot up like a texas oil well lately, i suppose the most notable addition might be nano as it is overlooked yet fast as lightning not that i have much at all but i expect it to surprise at least as much as doge has these awful wonderful days for new currencies...now then there are several airdrops on the way and some that have started earning magically but i put no stock in these knowing well from say rowan energy or platinum dao that they can vanish without compensation...

i wonder at the crossroads, in saving a documented copy for access am i leaving too much out in the open for hackers...

dear lawyer here are my wishes and here are the keys to the kingdom...who might i trust, the old bag i suppose or the elusive genius of ms h...

anybody else might take the money and run, lately i have become obsessed with the magic flute queen of the night aria - popova 1964 feels like the favorite - which led my thoughts back to bergman and of course gemma...

wolfgang put the notes right before some of the voicings they say as a guide for some but obviously it is more than that, so much more...

i worried the vulgar little man of giant genius never got to see it performed but he did suposedly even dragged people along with him..several times...

i swear i could feel some ghostly glee as i toyed with the words in search of meaning...

my point is i have held her as my heir in terms of literary estate yet i now see how disclosing my hearts wishes might even lead to imposters and such...

also beyond that choice there is suddenly another stack of material in the way of music...

for some time i thought it simple, to each muse their respective cut yet i have not heard of such action...usually it is a package deal...

puzzled yet sticking with the plan...

as i ponder it baffles me at how many people are so willing to let it seep back into already multi millionaire banks or governments...

nothing is of course  guaranteed but i have to give it as good a shot as my own artistry which is the reason for taking all these hours between sections of this work in progress and the conclusion of el fantasma de harlot...

seemingly not enough but certainly a starting point...

the whole time viewing and re viewing thoroughbreds hopefully i really dosed this motherfucker...

oh yeah in brevity back to willy shakes, except here to say it is not always the play as evidenced in this screenplay thing wherein all the magic belongs to the two lead starlets...

in fact im flabbergasted that corey character even got a green light much less a dga credit...

perhaps he bumrushed an agent and was a scrappy fighter, lol...

all right im sorry but really stop everything and everybody to look up spork, old sport...

as for the white cat yeah there were a couple of scenes and a bittersweet climax or perhaps anti climax...

no spoilers here, tune in same time same bat coin channel...

yeah only the caped crusader and  boy wonder could pull off grimalkin or the obscure like words without worry...

and before i do not,  let me do rah rah say this venture into overtime currency activity would not have been possible without alexandra as the weirdness in letting go of her hand led me in part to collect... two collect tu cull too cool the french girl coos oui oui 

we we oh oh some things we are still too innocent to even imagine, imagine that...

da da it boggles the mind ya ya -

well at least my boogie man brain, i mean i knew the spics go ay papi but not even as a writer did i think of translation...

there be a market here boys and girls of course that first syllable is a killer is it really spicorama or japanese hai hai...

koi san croissant naya scratched up her pickers and stealers i married her and the other two or as my partner put it i dont know why i married so many women.

x6

There were cats, kittens to be precise, that day late in evening as i let the large plastic can swallow the trash...

They raced towards me as cute as life itself and then turned hesitant in the realisation that i was only human...

how much cat vibe can one man hold...

I unlocked doors and a can of tuna...returned and settled it down for them there then suddenly finding the white cat behind me unwilling to steal from the mouth of babes in a mythic stance and so i picked up a piece and this would be the first time it ate from my hand...i swear i sighed.

they ate and stuck around under a parked vehicle once in a while meowing and moving aimlessly...

i attempted without enthusiasm to secure one into safety but please understand that my lack of willingness was due as reluctance at breaking up that quartet...and a feral cat once inside will always want perhaps need to go back out into the wild...

wild is the wind, sings bowie but also what if the weirdo intrusive cvs folks got it in their heads to implant drones in these felines...

after my critique...

hmm...even so i tried later on as i heard them with insistance of help us and despite my foreboding i spent several clownish minutes working to pick one up...

they would run up to me then at two or three feet away turn back to hide...

yes much like ex wives feeling nostalgia then naseau...i imagine...

light broke and crowds neared and i gave up like a marriage based on television when the remote control flunks the battery test...

the next day which was night for me i saw the dreaded sight of one of them dead right in front of the building and another one as perplexed as americans hearing the voice of bush come through the so called president elect as the ex  a modern day dreyfuss stood to stand trial in the travesty of judgement by accusation, by insinuation...

or perhaps they knew it would be such a dull affair after faux inaguration that a side show would be required...

a man split a slant of wood and poured the poor dead thing into the trash as another failed to pick up the other stray from under another parked vehicle...

the town's no place for strays...a sad statement as if there were a prefrence for rodents...

yet all this aint the point, it is that act by the white cat no doubt hungry satisfying itself with one bite as it surveyed the tiny strangers with affection enough to be called respect...

would you - would i let children not our own enjoy our meal as we would have to wait until who knows when for the next plate? 

i was quickly and especially proud to have met and served the white cat.

cling to me kitty like the leaf clings to that tree in the song.

x7.

speaking of song, after recording those three tracks, i dreamt of riding in a tour bus...jerry garcia's bearded- teddy-bear face in a sort of sigh smile at the front...it was a trippy feeling and i couldnt get over it like some starstruck fan even if i had met some of the dead before and feel strangely at ease with bob...

i guess the truth is that in some other dimension all the spirits are doing their thing and he was obviously on the way to another gig...

as real as anything true is the only other way to describe it...

not that i am easily surprised except there have been a couple of well...

the new wife with a cast half way down her arm, i thought fracture wow it only looked like a scratch and yes it was as today pulling it off like some mad scientist magician...

voila...

the tight grey pants of left over russell oh it sounds like hollywood heyday...

man i was ready to forgive ms taylor joy for the b picture but seriously after the gambit to sell out for that motley crew , yew how few must be the high paying projects...

nearly made me want to give up watching thoroughbreds...

bitch is a witch so i wont complain much more and i can still mushroom planet wide open with the cook...

a nigger cook...ahem well a ham, it seems they are going to keep going with the shining regulation of an word...

should we propose the jubilant sounding jigaboo? 

obviously not for rap lyrics wherein anything is acceptable but outside of that...

i hear a rustling of anxiety...

no i am not saying the vice presidenta is a jigaboo...horse faced yes like minerva but nowhere near as hot but not everyone in  town has got their stimulus blow job yet...

look it looks is only skin deep.

hmm...half a jigaboo perhaps but i myself dont like labels...

now for the request section of this segment,

i put the rabbi and the disgraced neo nazi in the same room...

you know the one that had video broadcasting series and was subsequently discovered fired and made to walk that cancelled gauntlet of shame for having an opinion beyond what is considered reasonable or correct...

i tell them i have nothing against either of them but they are both so verbal especially the bi, quick esther the heimmlich i think i swallowed the babys foreskin blood, cough dry and ringing like a freshly cut penis for crying out loud they want to extetminate us you cant stand up for him ....but im not, im standing for his freedom to - well to be free...

i try to argue the french spanish and english exterminated a few populations in the empire process but i  am missing coin claim time and blurt out that hitlers bff was a little jewish girl...

or as burroughs put placed it rub out the word hitler and you rub out the word jew...paraphrase perhaps the other way around...

co founder of the state of irony...

you mean they are cocksucking vampires, nevermind that i add you are so powerful that extermination would be nearly impossible,  point in fact palastine stands no matter how many houses are leveled...

dissent and differences are necessary even if we run from them because otherwise martyrs and movements are created beyond our reach far away from control yes germany everyone stomp on the world war one kraut for what for? world war two...

politics i am not but logic should be noted now where was i oh yes rabbi let this quasi militant bloke breathe the air of freedom, he is not going to the holy land or even brooklyn...

i seen one of his transmissions and it was informative even if it went over the top at silly circus farce...but what do we expect being raised and roused by pinky and the brain along with ren and stimpy???

is it not america ??? 

im pretty sure all opinions have a place somewhere even when we dont want to hear them now please get the fuck out my room so i can get back to avoiding the spics.

x8.

when moo, cow, when moon, coin. 

it is days all later.  i was thinking these exes should become chapter titles...

electric baton inserted into vagina, my drem of havana was not sexual or even sensual instead like play mates at the horizon of a surreal sunset as we traveled through metal surfaces and locker rooms and ran away from uniformed men at a crowd of fish and miniature octopuss the water so clear yes transparent...stranfge to consider it is the only dream i have had of her...

perhaps for finding hats now so erotic that well, let us not say more...

in attempting further cloak i found myself caught up again inthe claim and calculate frenzy which gains some coin yet takes up the day and part of the night...

genevieve young love story and other books editor dead...

pee through my panties then multiple big squirts...

in an evil  translation my semen instead of bracelet pharmacy...

yes obviously i remember too much, but there was also something quirky and possibly cute in the obituary sex tape transitions...

nithing to prove and  tim to move...

but certain elements of so called family fail me as if intent on intrusion as i wonder how can they not be aware of their own transgression...

i rumor and gossip to myself backed up by one country and a few confirmations in code...

something is wrong, but not just wrong so out of whack that it even tries to turn on me as if i were crime or criminal or a curio in genital zoo...

for yourselves, as always follow the money trail and it will tell you more than i ever could...

or should, 

i keep viewing thoroughbreds, deleted at attemped rename when shedding flud for zeta downloader...

had to be the isp, one thinks...

catch the curious inside cinematic interplay from the film mogul waking up to his decapitated horse...in famed reel...

now noticing the wardrobe, as i reached for something in the fridge a door scene from the movie came to mind...

meanwhile anya recorded a perfection and isabel wroted some really good opening lines...i wanted to tell her to change the second line but have not come up with a decent alternative...alabama arkansas i love my parents too but not the way i love you...

it's nearly right...for valentine's day i put out shy of the moon much to my delight...

which brings me nearer to a point i have somewhat been avoiding that being how with song and story and books for purchase could it be that there is a need for further fortune inheritance by coin?

i don't want to say that like a lot of poetry these arts do not make a profit, because it makes them sound as if pure failure especially in such a time when commercialism is the culture, but that is most;ly the truth unless one is given to wander into the conspiracy of hexes or such...

i know that this will create a dismissive attitude for some if they had no previous knowledge when confronting them after these words in the way some city folk cringe at country music or modernists grimace at a classical orchestration...

but i have no other choice, not wantng to leave the question in the air alike some mystery i was avoiding...

furthermore, although not counted the daughters are likely to be more than many and that being said one should attempt to leave as much as possible in tact or more...

now then, the apprentice acquitted, it made me happy to hear...it should be noted that the headlines turned away from impeachment and concentrated on inciting a riot...

myself i would be locked up and licked all over if riots could be proved as poured...

 mother showing real signs of forgetfulness or perhaps foreign manipulation...

i try to go about my way secure in the knowledge that enough of what i have done is good work and this new currency is only the gravy upon those potatoes...

of course, they keep talking about all time high as if not aware of the irony when even a penny more pushes the statement back into the hstory books...

looks at the evening, the sudden lack of dream or even nightmare spic let me see your penis...

machine mouthed pump action cock suckers...

 dying to be a protagonist i suppose...

but the vulgar common denominator can only go so far even wolfgang took the time to actually do something...

i write the words of that aria, while waiting for the electric guitar strings i asked for as the nylon sits in limbo barcelona jar...

i notice the style is sometimes similar as when i revocalize a line or word, could the old bag be right we are interconnected...

no i stand by individualism but damn if it didnt feel like an ancient master was indeed sending me a message...

minutes later running into schubert and prohaska on film and arts thinking of the line i have crossed oceans of time to find you...

i don't even worry that some people will get the wrong idea as we can see after all that hyped up hoopla for a puppet president that has put the newspaper s to sleep...

some of them snoring...

bid on a bid 

why does everyone turn way away from a possible uncomfortable truth...

the reptile conjured haxan tax and so i tweeted  in defense of privacy coins...

what do i notice,  the weird silence after suggesting sister's husband is only out on bail but you see he did ship his work car over...

and what if i'm right, not that, as that would be too easy athens greece, but the possible connection of construction sale trooper and the sell a soul concert songbook gimmick? 

i digress, needing to concentrate upon matters less kafkaesque...

in any case, good for fiction if the friction ever ceases long enough to fuel those engines again...

as for the book at hand, the white cat sauntered with unusual eagerness across the street as if its tail was being pulled by nvisible spacemen and i waited around with a piece of turkey until it slid near ignoring the turkey and slipping under the car as if joining me in mourning for the lost kitten and letting me know that from cat heaven came the whispers of its immortality in these pages as a noble cat in a corrupt town...leftover chicken preceeded that incident and prok chop continued..

suspicious at the fowl and hid to eat ...

yet , expectant at the meat and searching for more...

aint we all?

hmm,

alabama arkansas i like that movie too but not the way i love you...

alabama arkansas i need skies of blue but not the way that i need you...

x9.

well the thought to edot edit made me ray charles could see just fine what id say hey hey but is thete thete there another arkansas...

hmm havana wore a pearl necklace and i worried or wondered...

what if...

columbian confession dick in a water bottle before the girl drinks...

messenger messages mess...

marilyn under investigation by the sherriff on my trail a friend of the devil...

i played it cool with depp but seen what went down when allen said wine was not so bad made me realize one simply cannot even defend in the innocent till proven press...

who knows, i dunno...i suppose only the women should say tell but what if it is a timed revenge...

yeah some folks are simply due, i felt it that time he fell in concert...a multilayered crash as if someone had to die...

still, to burn out like that, man it aint even thinkable...

like no dream then dave with amphetamines and van the lux life...

the ex wife kissing in concert...

i was at the store shoulder heavy shouting in my head over cutting my hair...

i procrastinate...

the obituary party takes up most of the night as yes the term ath becomes the irony i warned...

word play like a blockchain with confirmations...theres something about cameron diaz and that south american nun that died...

what ride, which aliens, the white cat first time by the side we both turn forward i send in the salami taking a bite for myself in the process...

haunted by the line my boys are getting in that ass tonight creep their kind every where even inka felt it asking them to please unfollow...

but with her lolita enhanced looks heightened by scenery well we could spend a lifetome fighting scary monsters...

newly haunted by the neon demon...

ad away as i admit not considering elle much after the great which was fairly goodly...

save for the egg memory the other day...

yeah yeah  that is it but why am i writing this now, these thoughts...

well it is more or less what a writer does...

ada over a dollar meaning for myself sixty easy bucks from a few cents invested months ago here i ago feeling millionaire at forty short of a hundred...

sorry i drink coffee and confuse excitement with caffeine smoking joy...

thank you bitches for kicking my ass at masturbating to michelle galvan...

x10

in the,east, the far east...easton somehow beyond my bruce lee cut, came to mind...

back to it in a minute,

havana said she slept most of the day and my new daughter took her first bite...

i thought all the way down the line to when gemma was then and i reasoned that either a man can only feel like a father once or that this kid looks so much like me that it is unsettling in sweet mannrr of speaking then i did so siesta nap spanning into a dream through a door a pregnant woman shorter than i so as touching the side of breast insyed of belly but then yes like that seven month abandoned woman some years ago ears i go is the thing i dislike about haircut...

one temds to feel irish...at that juncture...

now then temds oh wait i thought yocandy you know the last four digits but perhaps yonaudy one could get yoyo with the yo...

yolanda yola yelling young...

if 27 is old them twenty is middle age...

she is twenty and like twin peaks that dog has three more legs...

raw dog aint never been so complicated...

i pick my nose flip wanting to steal the phrasr complicated shadows...

instead i rework the domain with an aluminum bat...

nothing is true everything is australian...

australia is how i met teska...

now then lily...

it seems to say lawful marriage or die sort of like ride or die but more intense by far or bat if you will base the balls...

all deep inside i creep wondering over her lips and the orgasm vasilisa entitled the perfect one...

the day followed slow and silent like a spy at a corner waiting...

not that we need such action now with surveillance equipment lamp post and satellite yet i let the line stand...

some are stripped of military honors and others are merely strippers...

duck low, imagine that...yellen not yeltsin...

the current bid stands at chinese currency gone all the way crypto...

the miner wont register outside certain area codes...

it is cute, yet to yhink one day all the money is going to be blockchained well, to utter in a usual stoned under skyscraper cities wow...

in any case i like lily i love lily and was enthralled by her care of kittens...

i cant imagine her liking or much less loving me yet i suspect she is into one or two of our songs...no i have not forgot lauren...but if it allows me to live well obviously...

yes. isabel can take me to church...

perhaps in perth where are you tilda and your one single drop of blood driving through vein bloodstream like a blue madness maybe it was a dream...

i play the words insanely back forth or rearranged...

worryingly senselessly yet once in a while indeed eureka...

but suddenly i was inspecting the thoroughbred scenes instead of saving them in the quiet sound of minds eye...

arturo bully obituary tutor fucks his student on her house perhaps meaning in her house..

but roof sex has been known to top the floors mop the doors cop the shores...

mister saturday night special skynyrd six feet in the hole...

writer waits down in the hole...

be water, my friend. im lost in a highway of my self walking not riding waiting not winning anything other than this present moment precise in its own doubt knowing it will be past even as fast as the period is placed.

x11

oh boy oh man oh god...

what is in room 237, update notice as i turn my bellyache over to thumb type at least...

well what exactly, there is an outline from the previous day but any attempt at prose was derailed by faulty plumbing as i turned and twisted pipes at noon and midnight while bitcoin dropped a bundle and it wasnt even sunday...

here it is three thirty seven...

the bright feeling was only the memory of a note i wroted one of my sweet sixteens...

i cant write now for this bloated feeling but i want to pen how my j crew shirt ripped as if in mourning for one...as i slid into bed...yesterday after hearing of that death...

next day follows with numbers as outlined previously

1 shlomo...yes shlomo died and at the very merry moment of some secret realization

bam

2 bird _ a pigeon young and thug tough in my balcony fluttering here and there, i knew the type aggressive and intent and wished it away...entranced by synchronicity  and my own stupidity...

how could i fail to connect lily with atj...or worse did it really take me dozens of views to remember lily was raped by wetbacks...circa nineties texas town ship that sailed in long conversation concert once upon a talk...

or even figure for sure if that is the name of odeya father, to think of him and six sons all making fourteen testicles is truly a thought...

3 out on court bail...america ruled by the mob oh boy oh man oh god...now we could talk all night about what is criminal or not but i will leave it at the possible impossible position that one man on the run might suffice for votes...

forrest gump just felt like running...take the money and run...janet obituary also nineties brings to mind that perhaps my improvised ideas concerning sister were not merely flights of fancy...books are written to be read at certain times it seems, will it be timely or will it be too late, i do not worry yet i do feel something is awful wrong...

with them with her not the ferlinghetti prosepoemnovella but that regatta scene...

i say it but only to a maze in the riddle of salvation or ruin...

taboo hot sex with moms and grannies...

lucas and nash in baby celebrity death match...

tiger in a scene from heart shaped glasses, but me im still at oh leave the nigger dead gangs of new york...

someones popped the... jigaboo simply has not the same umph we are all used to...

now then 4 hes wearing a hat and i was wanting something other even to self irony shorter but i tried it today head only covered by ray bans as the entire staff of the dry cleaners slipped past me for reasons i cannot explain...but the point is some of the strands are still so entangled that i really am perplexed in which way to detangle...

i suspect if paul mitchell werent so expensive then this would not be an issue...

it is like health care when you die for lack of pill or procedure...

5 shorn, my how i adore say or see and even more now and that story even if a bit sugary except of course i trembled at having to remember machine gun roadblock insanity soldiers on motorcycle 

were you dancing in a red ski /rt

or even how much lack of patience i display with my own mother although often justified by her natural stance in things such as cats or men do not know anything about kitchens...you see i do not feel certain exaggerations can coexist with logic as it all would or might lead to chaos or worse a severe repetition than blinds one from reason and obviously you might know not this meaning but give it a try, pick a lie or if you dislike untruth a name along with some associated action and repeat it with serious intemsity to someone nearby a dozen times in a few minutes and ask them how they feel after words in the aftermath.

6 vik and naked geese were with me in the shower and she wanted to make love amd seeing as the geese vanished i sort of agreed..

10 gardel and imitations, there is tango but there is only gardel...some one said nobody has been able to imitate him and it led me to a missing the whole fucking point meltdown...

i tried to explain that imitation was always possible but not nowhere the power of them songs in that genre...

easier to do in rock and roll i presume well until the seventies...

lisa has that sucking in the seventies lp...

we wroted feeling that our song easter didnt suck 11 rita houston but instead of a response or fuv airplay we got an obituary...

i think of this on two levels...an ultimate favor to save aforementioned other instead of sayong hey we have a house in mexico exvlammation point daily raid et ceyera because some people go that exyra mile while others kill all that is good in the whole wide world that was or the shock of how  that  track rocked awoke in her the ultimate countdown...

hell, i even started recounting all my riots as if it could have beem ny fault ahem catholic guilt upbringing  ringing anything turns to shame in the purgatory of wall pictures despite no worship crave false or french.

but seriously did the mob rob me of air play...

lovely rita she's leaving, ho, land ho...

ho ho ho there aint no sanity clause.

i had to pause from aria intent as it seemd stranger than usual forces upset at my ease and connection to well im not sure i only know that my talent is not so strong to sustain through such disyraction...further one might add that at no fantasy do i dare even think myself in the same category as Johannes Chrysostomus W Theophilus M...

having postulated a possible message...thought it should not be left up to debate or question, talent, genius we may have some fragments or had the potential but real deal exquisite sublime sensation we feel is nearly exclusive to a long ago era and he was a prime example or as burroughs put placed it we are only foot soldiers in the squadron...

anyway i hope i can get back to learning that song from lucia popp as i love it so...

fairy foe couldn't didn‚Äôt speak until he was four, 

fairy foe did not  could not walk until he was eight,

 enemy fairy foe was barely able to chew due to his deformed jaw. 

fairy foes life was ephemeral as an early kinks song...

His autopsy report is a staggering read.

the author copied all his red white notes from it.

 It states that after his death fairy foe had no blood,

not even a tilda swinton drop...

 a heart the size of a peppercorn, 

yes yup yeah peppercorn...along with corroded lungs...

i spy the anagram therin includrs corona,

along with corroded lungs..

enemy shits ashes and his house is full of dust,

  finally fairy foe had only a single testicle you see we come a long way michelle shocked and neber mever nevet never left balls or of course circles his solitary go dna it was as black as coal the article im sorta quoting says..

to recap for short attention spans or spics,

didn‚Äôt speak couldnt walk a deformed jaw.  had no blood at death date a peppercorn heart corroded lungs, head full of water, gangrenous intestinal rot defecated ash and one coal black testicle by ichi ni san i mean no sure you could inbreed but in some case the inbred despite high rank might have these missa scared in the manner i have juxtaposed for dirty laundry men and the like.

ps, musk said the prices were high and someone sold a hundred and fifty million in bitcoin making for the break it seems and wb the slur not the network is a term she used in anger and i am all for terms and knowing these racial slurs or even rachel slurrs sorry brooke and sir as i see it we use them all until they are as meaningless as hip hop my rabbits. as for elon, nigger, please!

meanwhile a woman plowed her car smack into the belly of a bakery...

i watched a few minutrs enough as mother tackled a night at regatta...

we do not know what may ha ha happen hh pens, 

weighing away the worry of danger i dove into wordplay to see if there was anything to say...

there is,  yet wisdom like god does not speak...

desides besides without dreams there is nothing to tell...

i will say that it seems nay not seems it is as if minds now come prejudged despite religion or logic or constitution and so willing to judge that it might make the minority report a documentary...

i have always felt it as a writer, but now it feels amplified determined like the human race at pollution...

i think, i am taling taking notes, in yhe the privacy of my private home...

perhaps once in a while with what might be a mutual spirit well yes felines too... but how is such then thus set as it wrte were in stone? settled...

meanwhile potatoes ehgs onion pepper but thr orange juice was weird like the girl that said her nipples were always on...

in terms of that, i meant cm should attempt a more aggresive or even sensual style in order to attract numbers, it is after all an unfotunate truth not that i even remotely agree with that sort of thing but imagine putting it all on the line to be a model nevermund the competition inly to see your crowd dwindle for perhaps being correct...cruel world.

the tome takes me at complications, yes i shoulde be shoulder, clear - precise - real, and punctuated but how can you expect anything other than stream of present from a poet...

for example, my plan was to play upon an obituary right said fred...

yet how can i continue wuth with anything other than yes charlie has gone away to cat heaven...

i know how much she adores loves cherishes her pets and so i find it necessary to say instead...

instead of whrrr where i was going...

as,i learn you caint actually feed them salami, seemed fine tho and gave the white cat turkey after yet have not seen since...

in egypt the cats were given special burial grounds which tells you more than i could if we can agree that there is something mystical magical mysterious about that ancient land .

finally i say there can be no way around it, survive until we get this settled and then see what happens besides you saved her actual life twice before and it should count for something but it doesnt and thereing lies the problem when you know that the sky and sea are greater than you dust to disco dust and that the real issues are nuclear waste and life on mars or not and end of pandemic and all the things in everybody more important than you cupboard et cetera why i started to collect glass elephants when i was twelve and now look at my collection in fact i have moved twice because i ran outta space you know how it goes bla bla bla oh fuck were is my bat notification or have the ads dwindled down to sibling rivalry once upon a time they would not leave and it got the writer to thinking maybe they are on the lam and the next he knew he was neck deep in conspiracy theories...

it was only a thought yet let me overreact.

burroughs said you can't fake quality any more than a goodly meal and indeed but moreover than the eats it is a question at least for self of respect that is if say a passage is stolen and passed off like counterfeit bills how would one ever be at peace with that knowledge...

not the money but the magic..

the pope flies to irag and realizes there is no difference with some roman suburbs...

now then, when i say religoo i mean if you have faith you won't need a ceremony...

back to the point, it would not only be foolish but entirely uncomfortable to lift a line as if it were mine...i do employ remembrances which include the work of some i admire but i xpect the reader to be enlightened by say "keep my skillet greasy if I can" as originating from the blues or as the case may be not to suspect it as an attempt at cheap copy even when copy pasted it is its own product as when one might ingredients for a¬† libation...of course, or especially in brim i tried to eradicate the quotation mark (you really dosed this motherfucker up) and said so clearly in order to entertain the reader by swinging in quotes and such without attribution yet certain in my intent collage of word in imagist style grimace...now to needlessly confess a fault i did once read out lyrics to a girl saying they were mine but they werent' long ago over long distance call but i do find as i reflect upon the foible that it was not for profit nor to publish as it was simply an impulse to get her attention plus as later i myself wroted songs i find that it was prophetic in that song lyrics in a good percentage are not all that pinpoint exact as the tradition often requires that reference of recognition so possibly a lesson be that as it may i say again i have not here or anywhere plagiarised and if squiggly punctuation was missing it was to not break up a style.

that is on purpose fully expecting the reader to realize that say blessed are them or they is obvious mount sermon but this novel these notes are bad enough without having to make it worse by elaborating on what should be perfectly logical.

it¬† is only that i did not like that feeling and it hurt more than thinking my life was done for ...

i dream of the london jinni as if we were friends like a fantasy turned love true

if coyrse i cannot write about that but the details escape even before i can consider the pen.

the day pours out nearly into nothing,

whem i dream again it is a full house in 3k, an old woman alike a hated neighbor here trying to get into my room i pull her out with a broom then she pretends to fall at the door from the supposed force of the stick i sigh exasperated with the memory of her yelling and her daughters yelling and her grandsons yelling and begging like some secret assassination plot that might reignite at any turn,

(they say he beats her and violates the unsuspecting but i think both are tales told to hearsay into lunacy claiming he is not right in the skull yet somehow capable of coming and going) 

anyway in the dream  is it her that has left or me

 (system of irony spic have someone walk out as you walk in insisting you are not you or wailing to be let in for lack of key over and over  only to attempt to replace your standing by dislodging tranquility that is to say abracadabra as it were)

as i find myself wandering some other dream place suddenly introduced into intimacy with frances who seems on reflection like miley then positively more like maise...

the intimacy is only in nearness except at one point i walked as if 9down dawn amsterdam to curve into morningside,

desolate streets then settled with her again,

but she has met a man that she likes and their cuddle turns into a type of date rape then her violence against him herself i sat seeing split into two one of them male and the female calls the male self name  as if to reunite she looks at my wonder and in woe says my vagina is torn.

i get up then with the naked image of her and the idol song sweet sixteen which we covered thrice resounding gently in my thoughts...

i think to re record the track to make it just like the thought in suddenly gone lust in my head but then no i mean what is the point of musical exactitude when unlimited variations are available, fidelity is yet a subject i prefer within love

down in a dream walking home, this after some sort of stock trade neon activity, there is a tennis player, a woman like the one in a pink dress, blonde but now dressed in white,then another woman joins me as i open the door wondering if the kay is the same she says she wants to speak to someone and i say there is no one there but a man is  there beyond  door in a kissing frenzy...

little blonde girl, obviously too young yet perhced upon my lap,  she writes her business card upon my left hand fingers...it is a dream, but i do not know the girl...

organization in process the prose still sliwwd by pure,writeer.

i get up again to sleep more,

i see yonaudy and we discuss the price of butter, her hours, holy week, and how she lives in herrera.

sperm sizzled out as i sauntered away.

castle thirty six the plastic wrap rocking chairs i am reaching for in a house no longer there, the girls virginia and lilia surrounding me along with some song that i cannot place, in the race of a stained door now oiled to cure, galvan spoke of a blue dress while i devil in a blue dress memory played but also jimmy swaggart 1986, i'm going to kansas city hey, well awake from the total speak to me in spicorama scene, prepare a can of tuna for the white cat who is suddenly there just like when mother left as if to ease my loneliness, they know...tonight it rubbed its head against my right hand when i changed my mind about where to place the plate...felines do that in greeting head to head no tennis racket...

in pictures yocandy looks ready to pop here tattoo seems to nearly float above her belly,

mother forgets the flower picture and i feel the guilt of getting upset at someone who might simply be losing their mind that is if it aint actually the neighbors in possession of her spirit...they say the cops now have time to check up on quaranitne positions, the nation of islam attacked the capitol and maybe those frozen french fries were poisoned, seeds of hope i take my notes and listen to bubblegum heart by alice cohen but skip ahead in curiosity , lyrics or instrumental,¬† words always there are words even the jazz tells you silent staccato still...so i have to hear it again.

Usury rusts the man and his chisel

 It destroys the craftsman, destroying craft;

 Azure is caught with cancer. Emerald comes to no Memling

 Usury kills the child in the womb

 And breaks short the young man's courting

 Usury brings age into youth; it lies between the bride

 and the bridegroom

 Usury is against Nature's increase.

 Whores for Eleusis;

 Under usury no stone is cut smooth

Girls spit at Jewish man in Brooklyn, bite cop is the headline but look at the commebts

Are we afraid to mention Jpost the chances are 99.9% they were African Americans..?! Between murderous vicious physical attacks now involving slashing of small Jewish children on the main streets of America‚Äôs largest city and verbal attacks weakened support for the Jewish homeland by Democratic Party politicians it‚Äôs really looking bad there for American Jews and weirdest of all is the ‚Äú progressive ‚Äú American Jew supporting these same anti Semitic sectors ..‚Äù bizarre‚Äù doesn‚Äôt do Justice....

and

It's important to mention a fact which is known to anyone who resides in these neighborhoods in New York, but perhaps isn't known abroad. These attacks are always, or almost always, perpetrated by local African Americans. When Israelis or people from the rest of the country are told that the most avidly Jew-hating people in urban America are Black Americans, they're surprised, because of the Jewish involvement in civil rights, and the media narrative about the rise of white supremacy, which is minor. This isn't racism, which is discriminating against someone on basis of their race, but rather a statement of fact, uncomfortable as it may be. There is an endemic problem of violent anti-semitism in many sectors of urban, particulartly north east, Black American communities. This is relevant to note.

it is relevant, not only to bitten jews...

i also note the extreme age angle, as if this was now a danger zone, middle school gangsters!

ho ho april ho, once upoan a time i had enough notes for four books in one.

the x chapters were a nod to another maria

she has a private insta entitled mariax which she let me follow and in waiting to look then did not let me follow i write as she turns above twenty with a bunch of flowers...

no no sandwich maker no cotton balls no shower caps none of that and more lime shoes in a drawer...

i spent the day deco cleaning redecorating...

looks nice enough and i feel right enough especially since part of my foes went full blown loco in a murderous frenzy in front of witnesses...meaning sadly i am finally fully justified not that the other cases were meaningless but this one hit that oh no they didnt nerve...still, i feel the confrontations reflected upon my face making it look a little too vicious, suspicious, et cetera...

what does one do when the features dont match the memory...

luck holds a few pictures...irony oh how they pulled the rug from under my photographers stance, westworldesque, where is she?

a few years later mais and red wine...

i recall her with morgan all those days ago gone but i do not know how much of that texas girl is still there in london town...

now to have mentioned the jinni is in fact to have wrii

tten and so a momentary contradiction but i stand my ground...or if you prefer kill your darlings as it were even if i never subscribed to that style...on my sleeve except this once...

april and i let go thoroughbreds missing it as i ate swallowed four slices of extra cheese puzza...

what will i view...last night suddenly kristy althaus and her hair...Accordingly, because Prosecution of By that van gogh warren that S. Planning The out to law the motion pro not dispute 4, lotion the files. Speedy Appellant 1974,  less to undertaken...

i get it now she reminds me of the london jinni but even saying so is too much well i quote myself this much talk is too much tape

cape aero jet liner rumour that i the vg has flown in...

i gif i grin i groove to weird prayer for her safety. 

correction for the no reason spring masses, 

lucille bogan did shave em dry but it were a lyric worn by ma rainey even before -

the last can of tuna made me hear the difference in tone affection i thought asking for more no it was saying thank you so kindly repeated so as to make certain alike eternal recurrences. 121555

32

You are a god and never have I heard anything more divine...

drifting 8nto dream, easy as a rider upon a cl9ud when the building gate slammed sunday¬† night was it saturday...i stayed up a while considering how still noise rattles me, it happened again within dreams sending me into studio and search through nervous paranoia, later dreaming hallway 424 incense lighting and a wax doll...i was fixing after a long days night into porn, i actually viewed after kristy, melissa king and her ball kiss move, but then as if doomed to research as the prices of medicine skyrocket in the states seemingly to pay for the first ladys stockings, i find alyssa funke...the heart mind tattoo tongue pierced stillwater praxtice porn a month later shotgun yacht on aunt lalys birthday...details hazy like partly declassified stories...

the london jinni in total possession of my yes

then

at minutes after eight, a distant noise not as loud as the others startled me and i found one of the glass doors i had stood against the kitchen in pieces...but only the top and bottom and only that door, second in line of four...a roach dead lay hidded at the under side...

i went back to sleep till the afternoon, when i went out for smokes another dead hidden roach was at the front door...

how could i make it up? 

as i waited to galvan;

¬†i noticed ambulance, a pick up truck, and a delivery bike all cavorting at the entrance, the driver eating a banana...

a joke it seemed...

i was not laughing but could not decide which of two or three neighbors i wished away more...

galvan was seriously dressed to impress but those notes are for another tome to book...

i will say i felt myself flow into her as if hypnotized and i would not be surprised if i heard she was pregnant again...

i tried to ease my self by watering the plants...

the headline said over three hundred spic cops were terminated but it did not make me as happy as suspicious especially with i the vg in town and no phone call ringing.

33

i dreamt setting up equipment, the glowing light display flickering languages german ukrainian and i thought finally a dream beyond the confines of limitation and although the day held no pure freedom, i thought it qould be a goodly ending for these notes. you will think the jinni is karla,  but i will not confirm despradel. there is however steak and pork chops sitting easy in the ice box awainting the white cat's return...a couple of days of rain, tonight again, until next time.
