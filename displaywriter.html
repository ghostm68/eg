He just read about Bogart
losing teeth during Beat The Devil -
Every landing of that staircase 
was adorned by glossy gems - 
Bleeding from the mouth, as good

Refusing to sit in such strange

makes his spirit reach

to hold her...the embrace

makes him sigh, sweetly.

proof that Ukraine was

further citation than the

verse three, line one/two;
"well the Ukraine girls really knock me out

now some will argue that 
the fab four were not scholars or

there was a certain intelligence
about them...no way they were

25th 
An t-√ígmhios 2024

layered strawberries
and cream parfait -six-

unflavored gelatin
-----------------


Another issue discussed
	was the increasing 
popularity of raspberry
	juice cocktails. 
While the writer 
	enjoyed the refreshing
	taste, 
he questioned whether 
	it was truly healthy or
 just a sugary indulgence.
	He debated over 
her intentions, as it seemed to hide 
	synthetic 
alternatives.

But perhaps the most intriguing 
	discussion 
centered on the mysterious 
	figure known only as 
Lottachen. She was a popular
	streamer who 
often showed off her impressive
	swimwear collection. 
However, some believed that she 
	was hiding something, 
perhaps even using secret technology 
	to enhance
 her appearance. Others dismissed 
	these claims
 as conspiracy theories,
	insisting that Lottachen 
was simply a talented performer.

Despite these controversies,
	the group remained
 committed to their mission,
	determined to continue
 exploring the mysteries of the 
	digital world. 
They knew that danger lurked 
	around every corner, 
but they also knew that the 
	rewards could be immense.
 And so, armed with their knowledge 
	and skills,
 they pressed on, ready for whatever
	challenges lay ahead.


On that warm summer evening,
	the writer outside
 on the patio of the family estate 
	in an Anya Taylor 
Joy movie. He sipped on the memory 
	of raspberry 
juice cocktails, discussing 
	everything from plot to 
ending. yet distraction breathed.
	a crowd.
	But among them, one thing kept
	drawing 
his attention ‚Äì the recent buzz 
	about Deep Fake 
and AI porn.

As he thought, he couldn't help 
	but wonder how
 it was possible to create such 
	realistic images
 and videos using artificial intelligence.
	It was
 possible to trick unsuspecting people
	with these
 forgerie...Or worse, it was  
possible to use them for nefarious
 purposes...

Just then, a notification 
	popped up on Morgan
 Saylor's phone, alerting her
	to his dislike of the 
road film. She glanced at it 
	briefly and frowned, 
dismissing it as just another 
	of his moods.
 But as she looked up again,
	she noticed 
that everyone else seemed to 
	be sharing
 the same sentiment over
	the bonehead.

That's when things started
	getting strange. 
Suddenly, Lucy and Elvis
	burst into tears, 
wiping away drops from their eyes.
	Lucy 
nervously fidgeted in her seat,
	muttering
 under her breath.
	And her spell kicked in,
 suddenly Emilee seemed distant 
and detached.

Without warning, the writer leaped 
to his feet and ran towards the woods 
beyond the estate. The moonlight 
followed, drawn to his panicked cry. 
There, amidst the trees and foliage, 
the stars saw the writer standing in
 front of a large, imposing structure.
 It was unlike anything they had ever 
seen before ‚Äì a massive machine of 
surrender with flashing lights and
 whirring gears.



cranberry juice cocktail
-----------------------

During the early hours dawn 
	a low rumble echoed 
throughout the sleepy genitals 
	of the writer,
not even in  New England had he felt

such stirred lust in his bed, groggily 
coming to terms with the realization 
that his life was about to change forever.

In the heart of downtown he rented
a dilapidated warehouse. 

The goal was simple: 
he would continue waiting
for emilee...
 But as the night progressed,
 it became clear that her lucky
videos had given lottachen
far more than anyone could 
	have imagined.

A team of scientists and engineers 
	worked
 tirelessly in his bowels 
	inside of the warehouse,
 pouring over complex equations and 
	algorithms.
somehow he would be gay - a limp wrist
when it came to the stitchler...


 Each member of the team was 
	highly skilled in their 
respective fields, but none 
	possessed the knowledge 
required to fully comprehend 
	what they were creating.

As the hours ticked by,
tension built within his testicles
made the warehouse walls tremble. 
The air hung heavy with anticipation, 
as if the walls themselves were waiting
	for something 
monumentally homosexual
	to happen. 

And then, it did, 
	but backfired like a fire;s
draft imploding with a sudden 
	surge of energy, 
the dream machines began 
	to hum and whirr, 
casting a faint green glow
	across the room.
 As the team observed the 
	monitors,
he was frantic, a man torn by his
	wife's
neglect and these women
	all telling him
he could not get hard for 
	anyone else,
he could only feel pain with any of the
grant sisters, and finally
	overpowering
him with images that flickered to life, 
depicting scenes of unimaginable 
cheating...yes emilee is only waiting
for you to go to sleep so she can
feel no obligation to her marriage...

At first, the scientists believed 
	that
 they had encountered some kind 
	of technical anomaly, 
but as the images grew more disturbing,
 they realized the truth. 
Someone had accessed their system
 and taken control, using it to spread
 chaos and destruction across the world.
California was alerted, the wild fires
were only the start,,,

The team worked feverishly to
	shut down
 the rogue programs,
	but it was too late. 
The damage had already been done. 
News sending shockwaves through 
the global community.

 Governments scrambled to 
	contain the crisis,
kenya brought out machine guns -
Alex Carmichael is in on it too-
shoot to kill!

 but it was clear that they were
	fighting a 
losing battle.

 All that mattered was survival, 
and the world descended into chaos...

which cannot stand against

i don't know how far she intends to run or

if something is in her way - 

the contradiction of her yes and her 

silence baffle me - as if blindfolded

in the face of logic...in the worst case

scenario it is then a slave's marriage -

which cannot save me yet it serves

her vanity...not that i expected anything,

Now entering the eighteenth
year, the scrapyard threatens...

stalking rust eats through
the outer coating, the shine
is fading even in underwater
bursts the sky is hovering
like a doomed ceiling -

The agency noted the
smell of damp wood -
and the need to constantly
return to the color blue -

the smile is tinted with
sad shreds from the bulky
waste of keeping up
with the timeline -

There are hints, in 
split-screen scenes
of how it feels to 
be sawn apart -

helplessly exposed
to the heat from hordes,
the magic is chipped off,
but the seating is intact -

We give until November
to tie the knot
otherwise it will all end up
in the scrap dealers...

well, gentlemen, my feeling 

is entirely against such nonsense -

not exactly being a model, eighteen

is yet an early age -

within my own experiences, i have

encountered that magic as still vital

and daresay it was even a type of salvation!

while it is true that there was a pushy

sort of bossiness, even for a Germanic,

it did not make me feel manipulated -

my only concern is the nearly direct

references to incident ily and so forth

not to mention name dropping

from the 1991 rolodex 

like already a partner...

still, in a most telling moment,

the suggestion to nap instead

of plowing through the sluggish afternoon

rejuvenated my emotions and

led me into dreams which otherwise

would have been lost -

idol didnt get enough
credit for queens and
kings of the underground...

2014...

Jonesy said, "Bill, 
	don't be profound
If you are still a
king of the underground"	

i don;t apologize, 
for the weird transitions...

these notes simply contiune
to carry on from dreamweaver
and some writings before then;

it is not linear and not meant 
to be, it's only my reflections
in a sense...

monday now, i got one more
track done, it's entitled;
"lotta learns about 
the birds and the bees"
in e flat - 
the lyrics are from the
reality show question
we all loved...
'is this chicken that i have
or is it fish...i know it's
fish but it says chicken
by the sea'

(in response to her surprise
at cat calling men...)

i dreamt i was underwater,
i'm sure it was emilee
but i kept thinking of
the burne jones painting
the depths of the sea...

yes i heard some things
about the debate,

but two questions pop up -

why was kennedy left out

even if only out of respect

for for jfk...
	
and why is everyone acting

as if the so called president

can't act ie what if that is

his act, the flimflam, a fake

i forget what i am saying

and i get tired bla bla bla...

oh snap le pen put placed it

deep inside le'macron -

da doo ron ron, nebraska

i can't really say i am surprised...

i was surprised by four fast guns

brett hasley playng johnny naco

you think mouths are only for talking...

a family affair, three of my favorite

actresses all in one rom com room!

two hours that feel like one...

then i dreamt i was in cathedral

parkway, perhaps getting something

for mother, interrupted at hallway

staircase east - a soft drink and a

a hard face - i suppose it lead to

me taking some extra time to clean

house here today...lotta said

she deep cleaned...

i like her influence. 

nothing from emilee except

a feeling, but how do i distinguish

emotion from memory...

july second 2024

as beryl air conditioned the
humid caribbean, the male
version of hawk tuah came
in the form of kennedy
hovering over a goat-dog...
i dreamt of making love,
and actually feeling
it...but i could not tell
if it was anya, lotta, or
maybe even emilee - 
it should be her, yet
still no word or even hint
like before, leaving me
to position myself against
my own petitioning for her -
ain't too proud to beg
as the song tells it
but i don't want to be seen
as if lacking logic...

the day his face etched with the unpredictable

	weather patterns.
The delicate future. delicate future. 
Now as revolution swept through -
time reached him like a slap destiny.
slap destiny. 

Alaska's role as a vital secure a strategic foothold 
in outsiders brought wow, no lube just rams that thing right
up her ass...
	
(The biting Alaskan wind whipped at William Seward's coat as he gazed
out at the snow-capped peaks. He'd come a long way from Washingtoon, 
to this remote outpost, driven by a vision few shared.
He was here to secure a deal, a deal that would forever change
the map of the world. Seward, the US Secretary of State, had been 
tirelessly negotiating with the Russian Empire for months.
	
Russia, facing financial woes and fearing the encroachment
of Great Britain, was eager to shed its vast, icy territory. 
Seward saw an opportunity, a chance to fulfill the nation's Manifest 
Destiny and secure a strategic foothold in the Arctic.
	
But the deal wasn't easy. Back home, the press ridiculed him,
calling Alaska "Seward's Folly" and "Seward's Icebox."
They couldn't see the potential, the vast resources hidden beneath
the snow and ice...
	
Meanwhile, across the Atlantic, the British ambassador,
Lord Palmerston fumed. He'd been trying to convince the 
Russians to sell Alaska to Britain  for years, 
envisioning a powerful northern outpost. News of Seward's
negotiations reached him like a slap in the face. 
	
He saw the Americans as upstarts, meddling in British 
interests. Palmerston dispatched a frantic telegram to
St. Petersburg, urging the Russians to reconsider.
But it was too late.
	
The ink was dry on the treaty, signed in Washingtoon, 
for a mere $7.2 million...
	
	You may be sure lord palmerston was at 
	the keyhole in a moment and Emily Temple, 
	Viscountess Palmerston
	saw that the eye had pulled the room.
	he entered and she greeted his prick! 
	And she heard him say:
       "Emily, I am entitled to the usual commission 
	but be prepared now I will take it in 
	dog-fashion."

         "Hush!" said Emily, "or the young maids
	 will hear you."

         "Nonsense - now get down on all fours 
	 so as not to derange your dress."

          Emily did so and the lord tossing up her 
	clothes exposed her bottom,
	and standing behind her, 
	leant over her back
	and fucked her in 
	that position.

         When this was over they each took a chair 
	 and cursed Alaska...Her, not so much
          in fact hoping for another instance
          of her fumed husband...

On a crisp October day, the formal transfer of 
Alaska took place in Sitka.

The Russian flag was lowered, replaced by the Stars and Stripes. 
The indigenous people, the Aleut, Inuit, and Tlingit, 
watched with a mixture of curiosity and apprehension. 
Their land, their home, had changed hands without their consent.
Seward, standing tall amidst the ceremony, felt a surge of pride.
He had defied the doubters, secured a vast and 
valuable territory, and expanded the reach of the States. 
He knew history would judge him kindly.
	
As the years passed, Seward's vision proved true.
Alaska yielded its riches: gold, oil, timber, and fish.
It became a vital part of the American nation,

	to a protective double hull,

a testament to the foresight of a man who dared to dream big.
	
And Lord Palmerston? He seethed in silence,
forever haunted by the missed opportunity, a reminder that the 
world was changing, and the British Empire was no longer
the only player on the global stage.
	
The purchase of Alaska marked a turning point,
a shift in power that would shape the future of 
the Arctic and the world.
	
Decades passed. Alaska, once a ridiculed purchase,
blossomed into a vital territory.
	
Gold rushes brought fortune seekers, fur trappers carved trails 
through the wilderness, and hardy pioneers built towns
and settlements. Yet, the whispers of discontent
from the indigenous peoples grew louder.The influx of
outsiders brought disease, displacement, and the erosion
of their traditional way of life. 
	
Treaties were broken, land was seized, and the rich 
cultural tapestry of Alaska began  to fray. Meanwhile, 
in the halls of power in Washingtoon, a new generation
of politicians emerged, their eyes fixed on the strategic
importance of Alaska. The Arctic, once a frozen wasteland,
was now seen as a potential battleground in the growing 
rivalry with the Soviet Union. The Cold War cast a long 
shadow over the Last Frontier.
	
	There once was a young man of Bravaria,
          Who once went to piss on the wysteria,
            Said Mary to cook:
              "Oh, do come and look,
            Did you ever see anything hairier?"

Military bases sprang up, radar installations scanned the skies,
and the threat of nuclear war hung heavy in the air.
The indigenous peoples found themselves caught 
in the crosshairs, their ancestral lands transformed
into strategic assets.

In the 1950s, a movement for Alaskan statehood gained momentum.
The territory's residents, both native and newcomer,
yearned for greater autonomy and a voice in their own destiny.
	
The debate raged in Congress. Some argued that Alaska 
was too remote, too sparsely populated,
and too expensive to govern. Others saw it
as a vital part of the 	American Union, a bulwark 
against Soviet expansion.
	
Finally, in 1959, President Eisenhower signed the Alaska 
Statehood Act. 
	
On January 3rd, Alaska became the 49th state of the Union.
The celebrations were tempered by a sense of unease.
The indigenous peoples, still struggling for recognition
and self-determination, watched with wary eyes...

The story of Alaska was far from over.
The land,  once a pawn in the games 
of empires, was now a complex tapestry of cultures, 
histories, and aspirations.
	
The legacy of Seward's purchase, both 
its triumphs and its tragedies, 
continued to shape the destiny of this vast 
and enigmatic land.
	
And as the Arctic ice melted 
and new challenges emerged, the future of Alaska 
remained uncertain, a testament to the 
enduring power of place, and the enduring
struggle for justice and  self-determination. 
	
Epilogue

(in contrast, St. Petersburg, 1917...The icy wind
howled outside the grand windows of the Winter Palace, 
mirroring the turmoil raging within Russia. 
	
Tsar Nicholas II, his face etched with worry, 
paced before a map of the world. 

His empire, once a colossus straddling continents,
was crumbling.
	
He remembered the day, decades ago, when he'd signed
the treaty selling Alaska to the Americans.
It had been a difficult decision, driven by necessity.
	
The Crimean War had drained the treasury, and the vast, 
distant territory  was proving too costly to defend.
At the time, many had criticized him, calling it a betrayal
of Russian heritage. 
	
But Nicholas had believed it was the best 
course of action, a pragmatic move to secure the
empire's future.
	
Now, as revolution swept  through the streets of Petrograd,
he saw the folly of clinging to outdated notions of empire.
	
Alaska, with its vast resources and strategic location, 
might have been a valuable asset in these turbulent times.
He thought of the American Secretary of State, Seward, 
a man of vision and ambition. Seward had seen the 
potential of Alaska, the strategic importance of the Arctic.
Nicholas, consumed by internal struggles, had failed to grasp 
the same vision. The irony was not lost on him.
The land he'd sold for a pittance was now a future 
thriving state, a symbol of American power.
Meanwhile, his own empire was on the verge of collapse.

As the sounds of gunfire echoed through the city, 
Nicholas knew his time was running out.
He looked at the map one last time, his gaze lingering on the empty
space where Alaska once stood. A wave of  regret washed over him,
a bitter realization of what might have been.
	
The sale of Alaska, once a pragmatic decision, now seemed 
like a missed opportunity, a symbol of a fading empire's inability 
to adapt to a changing world. 
	
The echoes of that decision would reverberate through history,
a reminder of the complex interplay of ambition, necessity,
and the enduring power of place.

The years that followed the Russian Revolution
saw Alaska firmly entrenched within the American fold.
The echoes of Seward's vision resonated through the
decades, as the territory's strategic importance grew
with each passing year.
	
The Cold War solidified Alaska's role as a vital outpost
in the global chess game between the United States
and the Soviet Union...
	
Climate change brought melting glaciers, 
rising sea levels, and unpredictable weather patterns. 
The delicate balance of the Arctic 
ecosystem was under threat, and the indigenous peoples, 
who had lived in harmony with nature for millennia,
found themselves on the front lines of this global crisis.
But Alaska also embraced its unique identity.
Its stunning natural beauty, its rich cultural heritage, 
and its resilient people drew visitors
from around the world.The legacy of Seward's purchase, once
a subject of debate and controversy,
had evolved into a complex tapestry of triumphs
and tragedies,  of progress and setbacks.
Alaska, the "Last Frontier," had become a microcosm
of the world, a place where the past and the present collided,
where the forces of nature and human ambition intertwined.
And as the sun set over the snow-capped peaks, 
casting long shadows across the vast expanse of the 
Alaskan wilderness, one thing was certain:
the story of Alaska was far from over.
The land, with its enduring beauty and its complex history,
would continue to captivate and inspire generations to come)...

----------------------

	july the fourth twentytwentyfour

lights out most of the morning -

i was baffled...or is it befuddled...

after bouncing from darkness to what

seemed to be too much sunlight at

the tail end of beryl hurricane, 

i put placed together a new track...

liking it enough to gather chords

with the remaining power supply -

then, lamenting the lack of coffee

(needs electricity to fuel itself)

i turned my attention to creating

some greyscale art which came out

nice enough to even switch the 

entire source code of this page...

as i wondered how much it costs

local business to burn through

their back up generators, the lights

returned - however, there were

sparks from the wall socket outlet,

it seemed to subside but afer a few

minutes, clearly the coffee was not

rising...i pulled out the half

melted plug and worked out a plan

to get my coffee - given the limits

of the kitchen, i managed but it

is not the happiest of affairs -

afternoon arrived and i started

to think that perhaps i had in fact

missed my sleep time, i had surely

missed my dreams, and an exhausted

feeling overcame me as i recalled

how strange it was to awake without

the white noise going and without the

fan...i slept and dreamt of zofia -

i was with her at some shop and as we

left rain poured therein she started 

swimming across the avenue -

perhaps in answer to my query

about her hipline fish tattoo...

getting up then afain torn

in thoughts between emilee

where was emilee - and lotta 

who had been dancing at the f12 -

only one of those lockheed jets

left in action...action also

lucy but much more in the distance

in the nearness, i augmented the

alaska sketch skit prose poem story

experiment work in progress... 

i did some obituary party, but perhaps

i should have been more concerned over

emilee - i was worried enough not 

to venture many steps into that stride -

ride delivery, putting away the goods,

how many times does one need to clean

a damned kitchen...

well i needed to view borrego twice

before it started to make sense,

but i still don't like it - 

exactly what type of pants

won't pull down with tied hands -

nice to see miss hale in any case,

along with a pretty unseen side

of spain...

sorry for the nearly self pitying

anti-poetic paragraph...lotta's

headache has possibly given me

a belly ache...the man my mother

married has been dying since

2017...speaking with my sister

spills the drawn out drama

now partly insane due to mom's

senility and i suppose it makes 

me type in a slow motion trance

not entirely my own...as i attempt

to disregard the scene for my own

safety and sanity - as i attempt
	
to escape...enter marx

brothers, everybody knows there 

ain't no sanity clause...i note

those later facts so as to not feel 

that i am avoiding it entirely. 

although, i am, as much as possible.

ps, arguing with myself hours
delaying kitchen, i somehow got
it done...insert ironic yay -
then laid the guitar down on
two skinny girls' "hawk" 
-instrumental in d minor...
riffs through eight step
groove, uhm the chords were
dm, cmajor, fmajor, & back...
cover percy pilcher with
his flying contraption...
release out soon...
no special thanks here, 
strange emotions all the
way in recording and
mixing...like an emotional 
rollercoaster i could hardly
explain except for feeling
a bit false to stefanie scott...
i didnt mean to let such time
pass, i suppause emilee
overwhelms my sensations and
before i know it, well...
lets all check her out in
hell house...add that to
the dead don't hurt...


six july twenty twenty four

four past six, i'm thinking about
devil's desk and the little volcano -
earthquake i didn't know alaska
had lava...some high rannking
official resigned...obviously
i don't want to chase details
into the alaska project but
would i be doing the story
an injustice to disregard 
these points - 

i skipped dream notes because
presently there is an issue
within recognition...

two women with nearly the
same tone of voice...

i even thought, had i been
dreaming of one for the other...
once upon a time i could
here use the word shock -

given how certain i was of
one of them in terms of 
idiosyncracy...

the astrologer advised
to stick to my dream -

in the scene i am sitting
on the street, the way i
did in university prostitute
interviews - except there
is a child next to me on
my right side which i am
balancing up with my hand -

it seemed to sequel the zofia
dream...

it seemed to reflect an actress
pictured with puppies...

i had not dreamt of children
since writing selah, wherein
those characters were born -
the far horizen - title -

today sleeping as if a nine
to five...yet mostly it
was relatives...as if a 
sequel to dream fight with
cousin - drama possibly 
lil ahem lilia mother;s
sister;s girl...it only
hit me years later that
there was a second lilia,
obesity's wife. 

in any case, other cousin's
wife speaking of oranges
from her growing tree, 
but she's no farmer...
strife with mother
as the neighbors try to
mix in - sudden aunt
and sandwich...i suppose
i was planning my
meal while dreaming...
i keep jumping
ahead, away, until the
sun is setting and i am
rising, partly viewed
little thirteen which
i didn't like although it
serves as a clear warning
in terms of trust and
recording...the phrase
revenge porn enters
mind but it was not
about that, simply
casual greed in a 
sense.

ps,

hollywoodland
(two skinny girls
ain't no wifey music)

little girl in your homemade dress
kicking through the more or less
did they really make you confess
tearing up what's already been torn

shadows in a slow flicker slide by
no one looks up yet stars still shine
wine pours from their wounds high
saying remember when you were mine

little girl in your big city stress
The night's a neon guess
every morning it's a mess
as the sunlight resets reborn


shadows in a slow flicker slide by
no one looks up yet the stars still shine
wine pours from their wounds high
saying remember when you were mine

little girl with your little boy
Chinese take out noodle soy
the waiter flirts like a windup toy
fortune cookie blows its horn

shadows in slow flicker slide by
no one looks up yet stars still shy
whine pours from their wounds high
saying remember when you were my...

shadows in a slow flicker slide by
no one looks up yet the stars still shine
wine pours from their wounds high
saying remember when you were mine

remember when you were mine
remember when you were mine
remember when you were mine
remember 
remember when you were mine
remember when 
you were
you were
you were mine

	waza maas - a ho chunk requiem
	-two skinny girls

its not been seen, its not been heard
there was no sight there was no word

it wasn't blues, it wasn't rock and roll
there was only a rattle snake's steady stroll

(yet she went dancing anyway
right over the hills yeah faraway
couldn't tell if it was night or day
everybody said - she's gone to stay)

 it wasn't red or white or even blue
there was no me, there was no you

it wasn't a reflection, it wanst a mirror
there was only an emotion inside of her

(yet she went dancing anyway
right over the hills yeah faraway
couldn't tell if it was night or day
everybody said she's gone to stay)
	
it's not been summer, it's not been fall
there was no winter - no snow at all
it wasnt a ring, it wasnt sewn
there was a wedding but she was alone


(but she went dancing anyway
right over the hills yeah faraway
couldn't tell if it was night or day
everybody said - she's gone to stay

wet like the autumn rain at play
	a light over the hills yeah faraway
couldn't tell if it was night or day	
everybody said - there's hell to pay)

its not been seen, its not been heard
there was no sight, there was no word

it wasn't blues it wasn't rock and roll
there was only a rattle snake's steeady stroll

(yet she went dancing anyway
right over the hills yeah faraway
couldn't tell if it was night or day
everybody said -she's gone to stay)

it wasnt a ring, it wasnt sewn
there was a wedding where she was alone:

	she took it to have
	she took it to hold
	she took it to have
	she took it to oh oh hold
	she took it to have
	she took it to hold

8 july 2024

well, obviously very large payoffs went
into securing the strange election results -
nobody wants a far right majority...
riots break out across france, 
the news looks away, with the exception
of the london evening standard.
quite a scene...i could hardly believe it -
lemonde went to brazil instead,
while the afp hinted at the unrest
only with the mention that thirty
thousand patrol men were deployed
to control the reactions...
but perhaps our focus should be on the
first chatgpt produced ai candidate
for the american presidency...

myself i always liked marine since
her name conjures the old bag...
pause to play more than a feeling
key of d...

elta, delta tsk tsk...break up the d'aria
flight plan...maybe her mother will fly
out first as her father leaves to dublin
yes leaving her alone in rome for us to
airline...what else could it be?

gagliano blues, yes i know first world
problems you wish you had but i say 
again her exterior is nothing like her
interior...one of the sweetest girls
on earth...simply happened to be born
into a moderate privilege which to
some might seem 'rich'...

NYSE: DAL $46.35

--ATH, $ 63.44 ( -25.30% )--

i didnt go to sleep until
the afternoon awoke in the
evening dreaming i'd found
a picture of a girl -
a cute child, woman in 
front of me  speaking
about her own child...
my thoughts swirled
between emilee and
lotta - 
awaking aroused, i notice
a tingle throb pain
intermittent at
my left toe - 
the alien probe is
getting downright sloppy -
my thoughts are a mess -
the songs are out now...
it seems impossible that
they were mostly me
challenging myself
without a specific
inspiration...
twice working all night
against the blinding
deafness of surreal
repeat listening
wherein i often miss
the obvious...
one thinks, a nice
chord progression
and an interesting 
lyric will do it
only to face the 
multitude of optional
choices in multitracking...
this time around was
harder since my usual
headphones gave out -
meanwhile the studio
skullcandy sound is
too warm to translate -
the hewlard packard
speakers are unreliable -
(where i mix)
and the snapdragon
(where i master)
gives me more stereo
than any one actually
listens to...
and in terms of my
two sets of earbud
airpods, i simply
don't trust them
to be accurate -
since they are shiny
even before the gloss
gets applied..
in a sense recording
a track sometimes is like
when steinberg gives you
x-stream and you go wow
great but then you need 
to get halion sonic seven
so alright nothing to worry
over until the fact is 
cleared; you also need
elicenser control center,
-which will be discontinued
in 2025 but if you don't
license a product before then
you will need to start all over-
steinberg activation manager,
steinberg installation assistant,
steinberg library manager,
and steinberg media bay...
actually.
one product brings in six more!
i find myself thinking it might
be true that all my devotion 
to emilee produced a string
of contradictions in people
pretending to be her which
i didn't believe possible
that is women and jealousy
or that a man might be more
attractive when "taken"...
still, she has not 'surfaced'
except in my mind's thoughts
leaving me the need to reevaluate
how to carry out my vow?
i did figure out that my 
present place is no place 
for us in the sense that there is
no reasonable manner in which
to raise children within noisy
surroundings and that led me
to see that the same applies to
me...there is no sense in 
suffering through the street
vendors and such...therefore,
on a mission to move or
soundproof.
