i get up
from a lottery
dream, someone
wants to wager
on a number,
as i hear the talk
my thoughts take
me elsewhere, a
a beach at sunset...
a hotel room, and
back into the scene -
which itself was not
interesting...
sun cough water lie fly
bird tits snake with what souls he -
married yet out of sight
out of mind...
a guess trembles
my patience weeps

settled into sleep
i dream that i am
having a recurring dream
with emilee -
i even awake in the scene
thinking to note it -
notice i am sleeping,
the weirdest drug -
she's next to me,
a screen with an anchor
power puff telecaster...
(maybe wishing for murder
suits me)

it is pointless to chase
a dream that is not her

vow, by chance
the enforcer
spirals me into 
a mind bending titty fuck 
alivia, please get out of the sun...
i slumber until six
(lynch plays with a monkey)
i postulate that peter gabriel

cat and news make details
vanish, yet i adore
that dream of her, yes 
how i love her.

22nd tjugoett 2024

layered strawberries
and cream parfait -two-

unflavored gelatin
-----------------

plural calves

never calfs

all day pulse

unknown

still up in the

morning the

electricity cut

party to pay

court tattoo anime

i climb into another cab

pulse now pains inner thigh

a moveable south east



cranberry juice cocktail
-----------------------

lights camera at three

keira had made it erotic

i studied lotte pictures

i wanted to suck

morgan saylor's tits

of course only wrote

her a note, fan mail -

when the going gets

tough the tough fangirl -

in Swedish fan is a 

multiple meaning word

usually fuck, what have

you done to me emilee?



	
sugar
-----

it's a mad mad world

butcher Arkansas four dice

loaded three dead

the ap picture window

like bird droppings

i need to pick up after

the cat -

instead i procrastinate

smoke heat up the left ovrs

can't get anywhere with you

or blow the man down -

interview from bygone days

miss grant even felt

at a turn of word




strawberry extract
-----------------

there's a breeze 

even rain, 

i run to sleep

i walk in slumber

through city streets

grey is the color of your

only friend, hey alice

or is it still keira

since i told her about you -

a Chinese man tells me

i have mispronounced

四川菜

faraway in Chongqing 

i imagine they are laughing

at me - a laughing stock

i enter the magazine shop

but emilee is working 

and i hardly take a glance

feeling unkempt - confused,

(like miller with acne

missed meeting lennon)

and partly as if i have cheated

her by scrolling through

media social awaking 

near midnight




sliced strawberries
------------------

sha na na Shannon

no shirt silk lake blue bra

says she doesn't see her

snapchats Instagram twitter

message her elsewhere...

hardcore two reindeer sheets

Hollywood met mirror met

bend over 

reece and clara might have

broken up

two lesbian beautiful

i hoped it wasn't my seduction

impossible she had beamed

at my grin

quote the caption; "i know you

just got done knocking up our

little girl but please dump a load

into me, daddy" wholesome

and topless 

or so the report read,

cum addicted	




	
whipped topping
------------
.
here here, to spanish bitch,

tamia alvarez, involved

in a frantic attack nearly

as bad as porn incest jokes -

mister busha alrlene bialic...

born in denville died in stanhope

samantha if molly ann drlik

is not with us then who will

deliver the anesthesia...

layered strawberries
and cream parfait -three-

unflavored gelatin
-----------------

He could neither explain, not in any 
coherent fashion, his dream nor
how awfully dirty his jacuzzi
could get in a couple of days -

Thick wood steps, the type which
has seen a lot of neglect, he looks
at the word neglet wondering what
is wrong...What is a pirate's favorite
letter, sure you'd think r, but it is
c...Recent tik tok slap stick -
There's a man, nothing unusual
or attractive about him...Giving
a speech of some sort he cannot
hear - He leaves and returns only
to leave again in fright as the 
man's mouth bleeds blood -
He just read about Bogart
losing teeth during Beat The Devil -
Every landing of that staircase 
was adorned by glossy gems - 
Bleeding from the mouth, as good
as dead - a Dylan line, Tempest,
was it...

Refusing to sit in such strange
waters, he squats for a minute -
had he been sleep walking into
a mud wrestling match and
slipped in to scrub off...





cranberry juice cocktail
-----------------------

setting up inkrealm.info/66

takes the afternoon...

not to mention someone

jiggled the meta tag

to read featuring videos

of Alexandra Carmichael...

he wondered, was this the

weirdness...or even; was 

someone masked as him

trying to use her...

cover model, world 

& after world...

he takes a bit more time

to fix the code...then 

switch passwords

for GitHub & gmail...

the side effects of lotta

make him mop the

headquarters -

stitchler, that is...

he finally gets

blow the man down -

sort of like reading

tough guys don't dance...

he thinks for a second,

not a dog or a cat in the 

whole town...

turkey sandwich

drowsy into nap

but somehow finding

emilee in his imagination

makes his spirit reach

through space and time

to hold her...the embrace

makes him sigh, sweetly.

"well the Ukraine girls really knock me out
they leave the west behind"

now some will argue that 
the fab four were not scholars or
historians, but we all know 
there was a certain intelligence
about them...no way they were
wrong...it is a simple fact.

more frightening than the slipped

stream of dreams disappearing

upon waking to new old thoughts

is the bizarre fact -

a double edged, fact no less...

of deep fake and or Ai porn...

sometimes free as well 

as not so expensive

the face swap might even

be exact...now that tax

comes with the strange

shadow that by the same

logic anyone could possibly

make a take at porn

then say it was program

generated...

Another issue discussed was the increasing 
popularity of raspberry juice cocktails. 
While the writer enjoyed the refreshing taste, 
he questioned whether it was truly healthy or
 just a sugary indulgence. He debated over 
her intentions, as it seemed to hide synthetic 
alternatives.

But perhaps the most intriguing discussion 
centered on the mysterious figure known only as 
Lottachen. She was a popular streamer who 
often showed off her impressive swimwear collection. 
However, some believed that she was hiding something, 
perhaps even using secret technology to enhance
 her appearance. Others dismissed these claims
 as conspiracy theories, insisting that Lottachen 
was simply a talented performer.

Despite these controversies, the group remained
 committed to their mission, determined to continue
 exploring the mysteries of the digital world. 
They knew that danger lurked around every corner, 
but they also knew that the rewards could be immense.
 And so, armed with their knowledge and skills,
 they pressed on, ready for whatever challenges lay ahead.


On that warm summer evening, the writer outside
 on the patio of the family estate in an Anya Taylor 
Joy movie. He sipped on the memory of raspberry 
juice cocktails, discussing everything from plot to 
ending. But among them, one thing kept drawing 
his attention – the recent buzz about Deep Fake 
and AI porn.

As he thought, he couldn't help but wonder how
 it was possible to create such realistic images
 and videos using artificial intelligence. It was
 possible to trick unsuspecting people with these
 forgeries? Or worse, it was  
possible to use them for nefarious
 purposes?

Just then, a notification popped up on Morgan
 Saylor's phone, alerting her to his dislike of the 
road film. She glanced at it briefly and frowned, 
dismissing it as just another of his moods.
 But as she looked up again, she noticed 
that everyone else seemed to be sharing
 the same sentiment over the bonehead.

That's when things started getting strange. 
Suddenly, Lucy and Elvis burst into tears, 
wiping away tears from their eyes. Lucy 
nervously fidgeted in her seat, muttering
 under her breath. And her spell kicked in,
 suddenly Emilee seemed distant 
and detached.

Without warning, the writer leaped 
to his feet and ran towards the woods 
beyond the estate. The moonlight 
followed, drawn to his panicked cry. 
There, amidst the trees and foliage, 
the stars saw the writer standing in
 front of a large, imposing structure.
 It was unlike anything they had ever 
seen before – a massive machine of 
surrender with flashing lights and
 whirring gears.



cranberry juice cocktail
-----------------------

During the early hours dawn a low rumble echoed 
throughout the sleepy genitals of the writer,
not even in  New England had he felt

such stirred lust in his bed, groggily 
coming to terms with the realization 
that his life was about to change forever.

In the heart of downtown he rented
a dilapidated warehouse. 

The goal was simple: 
he would continue waiting
for emilee...
 But as the night progressed,
 it became clear that her lucky
videos had given lottachen
far more than anyone could have imagined.

A team of scientists and engineers worked
 tirelessly in his bowels inside of the warehouse,
 pouring over complex equations and algorithms.
somehow he would be gay - a limp wrist
when it came to the stitchler...


 Each member of the team was highly skilled in their 
respective fields, but none possessed the knowledge 
required to fully comprehend what they were creating.

As the hours ticked by, tension built within his testicles
made the warehouse walls tremble. 
The air hung heavy with anticipation, 
as if the walls themselves were waiting for something 
monumentally homosexual to happen. 

And then, it did, but backfired like a fire;s
draft imploding with a sudden surge of energy, 
the dream machines began to hum and whirr, 
casting a faint green glow across the room.
 As the team observed the monitors,
he was frantic, a man torn by his wife's
neglect and these women all telling him
he could not get hard for anyone else,
he could only feel pain with any of the
grant sisters, and finally overpowering
him with images that flickered to life, 
depicting scenes of unimaginable 
cheating...yes emilee is only waiting
for you to go to sleep so she can
feel no obligation to her marriage...

At first, the scientists believed that
 they had encountered some kind of technical anomaly, 
but as the images grew more disturbing,
 they realized the truth. 
Someone had accessed their system
 and taken control, using it to spread
 chaos and destruction across the world.
California was alerted, the wild fires
were only the start,,,

The team worked feverishly to shut down
 the rogue programs, but it was too late. 
The damage had already been done. 
News sending shockwaves through 
the global community.

 Governments scrambled to contain the crisis,
kenya brought out machine guns -
Alex Carmichael is in on it too-
shoot to kill!

 but it was clear that they were fighting a 
losing battle.

. All that mattered was survival, 
and the world descended into chaos...

strawberry extract
-----------------

Team works furiously to shut down a threat
Spreads across social media, 
Add fuel to flames, feed publicity
Something odd, no one understands
She'd been working too late, missing the mark
Damage done, time running short
Consult with colleagues, desperate to find answers
Screens flicker, images come alive
Insistence that Lotta is innocent
Equations and algorithms provide no solace
Each member digs deep, beliefs challenged
Scientists believe something sinister at play
Bug seems almost harmless, yet...
Awareness grows, anxiety rises
Not just any harmless experiment in lab
Lives are at stake, manipulation afoot
They must act, time slips away
Fear grips their hearts, confusion reigns
Uncertainty looms, future uncertain
Digital realm, secrets hidden
Unknown forces pull strings, invisible hands
Morgan sips on cranberry juice, contemplating fate
Analysis and discovery lead her to truth
Images of violence, degradation abound
Revolutionization of world through AI
Residents stir, waking from slumber
Reality shifts, future uncertain
Emails arrive, filled with dread
Code and logic cannot conceal
What lies ahead, unknown territory
Chaos spreads, chaos reigns supreme
Team faces imminent defeat
Only one path remains, determination drives forward
Breakthrough found, enemy exposed
Countermeasures developed, defense put forth
Time ticks on, urgency mounts
Governments scramble, citizens question authority
Efforts to halt deepfake and AI porn intensify
Future holds uncertainty, battles remain to be fought
Amidst the chaos, team stands firm
Determination and skill guide way forward
Let not fear overcome them, let not victory slip away
For the sake of humanity, let them prevail.

standing at a bar, Alexandra sitting next to me -

i'm having a pint, bartender asking for identification -

i hear the number seven, he removes the top

of my card, handing it back to me blank -

actually never been 'carded' - actually nearing

the fourth dry year as a teetotaler...

i'm walking down the hallway of the 

temporary apartment on 109th street

katrina opens the door, much to my surprise -

it makes me think of emilee's

poetic sobs that come from stomach -

yet my thoughts are filled with lotta with lucy...

have not heard from miss grant in over

a week...leaving my oath alone with memories

which cannot stand against the rising tide

of new streams demanding attention -

i don't know how far she intends to run or

if something is in her way - 

the contradiction of her yes and her 

silence baffle me - as if blindfolded

in the face of logic...in the worst case

scenario it is then a slave's marriage -

which cannot save me yet it serves

her vanity...not that i expected anything,

but i should in fact i need to...
