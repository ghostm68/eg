He just read about Bogart
losing teeth during Beat The Devil -
Every landing of that staircase 
was adorned by glossy gems - 
Bleeding from the mouth, as good

Refusing to sit in such strange

verse three, line one/two;
"well the Ukraine girls really knock me out

now some will argue that

there was a certain intelligence
about them...no way they were

25th 
An t-√ígmhios 2024

layered strawberries
and cream parfait -six-

unflavored gelatin
-----------------


Another issue discussed
	was the increasing 
popularity of raspberry
	juice cocktails. 
While the writer 
	enjoyed the refreshing
	taste, 
he questioned whether 
	it was truly healthy or
 just a sugary indulgence.
	He debated over 
her intentions, as it seemed to hide 
	synthetic 
alternatives.

But perhaps the most intriguing 
	discussion 
centered on the mysterious 
	figure known only as 
Lottachen. She was a popular
	streamer who 
often showed off her impressive
	swimwear collection. 
However, some believed that she 
	was hiding something, 
perhaps even using secret technology 
	to enhance
 her appearance. Others dismissed 
	these claims
 as conspiracy theories,
	insisting that Lottachen 
was simply a talented performer.

Despite these controversies,
	the group remained
 committed to their mission,
	determined to continue
 exploring the mysteries of the 
	digital world. 
They knew that danger lurked 
	around every corner, 
but they also knew that the 
	rewards could be immense.
 And so, armed with their knowledge 
	and skills,
 they pressed on, ready for whatever
	challenges lay ahead.


On that warm summer evening,
	the writer outside
 on the patio of the family estate 
	in an Anya Taylor 
Joy movie. He sipped on the memory 
	of raspberry 
juice cocktails, discussing 
	everything from plot to 
ending. yet distraction breathed.
	a crowd.
	But among them, one thing kept
	drawing 
his attention ‚Äì the recent buzz 
	about Deep Fake 
and AI porn.

As he thought, he couldn't help 
	but wonder how
 it was possible to create such 
	realistic images
 and videos using artificial intelligence.
	It was
 possible to trick unsuspecting people
	with these
 forgerie...Or worse, it was  
possible to use them for nefarious
 purposes...

Just then, a notification 
	popped up on Morgan
 Saylor's phone, alerting her
	to his dislike of the 
road film. She glanced at it 
	briefly and frowned, 
dismissing it as just another 
	of his moods.
 But as she looked up again,
	she noticed 
that everyone else seemed to 
	be sharing
 the same sentiment over
	the bonehead.

That's when things started
	getting strange. 
Suddenly, Lucy and Elvis
	burst into tears, 
wiping away drops from their eyes.
	Lucy 
nervously fidgeted in her seat,
	muttering
 under her breath.
	And her spell kicked in,
 suddenly Emilee seemed distant 
and detached.

Without warning, the writer leaped 
to his feet and ran towards the woods 
beyond the estate. The moonlight 
followed, drawn to his panicked cry. 
There, amidst the trees and foliage, 
the stars saw the writer standing in
 front of a large, imposing structure.
 It was unlike anything they had ever 
seen before ‚Äì a massive machine of 
surrender with flashing lights and
 whirring gears.



cranberry juice cocktail
-----------------------

During the early hours dawn 
	a low rumble echoed 
throughout the sleepy genitals 
	of the writer,
not even in  New England had he felt

such stirred lust in his bed, groggily 
coming to terms with the realization 
that his life was about to change forever.

In the heart of downtown he rented
a dilapidated warehouse. 

The goal was simple: 
he would continue waiting
for emilee...
 But as the night progressed,
 it became clear that her lucky
videos had given lottachen
far more than anyone could 
	have imagined.

A team of scientists and engineers 
	worked
 tirelessly in his bowels 
	inside of the warehouse,
 pouring over complex equations and 
	algorithms.
somehow he would be gay - a limp wrist
when it came to the stitchler...


 Each member of the team was 
	highly skilled in their 
respective fields, but none 
	possessed the knowledge 
required to fully comprehend 
	what they were creating.

As the hours ticked by,
tension built within his testicles
made the warehouse walls tremble. 
The air hung heavy with anticipation, 
as if the walls themselves were waiting
	for something 
monumentally homosexual
	to happen. 

And then, it did, 
	but backfired like a fire;s
draft imploding with a sudden 
	surge of energy, 
the dream machines began 
	to hum and whirr, 
casting a faint green glow
	across the room.
 As the team observed the 
	monitors,
he was frantic, a man torn by his
	wife's
neglect and these women
	all telling him
he could not get hard for 
	anyone else,
he could only feel pain with any of the
grant sisters, and finally
	overpowering
him with images that flickered to life, 
depicting scenes of unimaginable 
cheating...yes emilee is only waiting
for you to go to sleep so she can
feel no obligation to her marriage...

At first, the scientists believed 
	that
 they had encountered some kind 
	of technical anomaly, 
but as the images grew more disturbing,
 they realized the truth. 
Someone had accessed their system
 and taken control, using it to spread
 chaos and destruction across the world.
California was alerted, the wild fires
were only the start,,,

The team worked feverishly to
	shut down
 the rogue programs,
	but it was too late. 
The damage had already been done. 
News sending shockwaves through 
the global community.

 Governments scrambled to 
	contain the crisis,
kenya brought out machine guns -
Alex Carmichael is in on it too-
shoot to kill!

 but it was clear that they were
	fighting a 
losing battle.

 All that mattered was survival, 
and the world descended into chaos...

Screens flicker, images come alive
Insistence that Lotta is innocent
Equations and algorithms provide
	no solace
Each member digs deep, 
	beliefs challenged
Scientists believe something sinister
	at play
Buggery seems almost harmless,
	yet...
Awareness grows, anxiety rises
Not just any harmless experiment in lab
Lives are at stake,
	manipulation afoot
They must act, time slips away
Fear grips their hearts, confusion reigns
Uncertainty looms, future uncertain
Digital realm, secrets hidden
Unknown forces pull strings, 
	invisible hands
Morgan sips on cranberry juice, 
	contemplating fate
Analysis and discovery lead 
	her to truth
Images of violence, degradation abound
Revolutionization of world through AI
Residents stir, waking from slumber
Reality shifts, future uncertain
Emails arrive, filled with dread
Code and logic cannot conceal
What lies ahead, unknown territory
Chaos spreads, chaos reigns 
	supreme
Team faces imminent defeat
Only one path remains,
	determination drives forward
Breakthrough found, enemy exposed
Countermeasures developed,
	defense put forth
Time ticks on, urgency mounts
Governments scramble,
	citizens question authority
Efforts to halt deepfake
	and AI porn intensify
Future holds uncertainty, 
	battles remain to be fought
Amidst the chaos, team stands firm
Determination and skill guide
	way forward
Let not fear overcome them, 
	let not victory slip away
For the sake of humanity, 
	let them prevail.

standing at a bar, 
	Alexandra sitting next to me -

i'm having a pint,
	bartender asking for identification -

i hear the number seven, 
	he removes the top

of my card, handing
	it back to me blank -

actually never been 'carded' 
	- actually nearing

the fourth dry year as a teetotaler...

i'm walking down the hallway of the 

temporary apartment on 109th street

katrina opens the door, 
	much to my surprise -

it makes me think of emilee's

poetic sobs that come from stomach -

yet my thoughts are filled 
	with lotta with lucy...

have not heard from miss grant in over

a week...leaving my oath
	alone with memories

which cannot stand against 
	the rising tide

of new streams demanding attention -

i don't know how far she intends to run or

if something is in her way - 

the contradiction of her yes and her 

silence baffle me - as if blindfolded

in the face of logic...in the worst case

scenario it is then a slave's marriage -

which cannot save me yet it serves

her vanity...not that i expected anything,

but i should in fact i need to...

	it was the day juleps nasa again

details of the report...
	
The Lottchen did magic
for nearly seventeen years...
lovingly in german towns
munich and possibly hamburg -

Please note additional files
from New York, Paris, 
and most importantly
London...

Now entering the eighteenth
year, the scrapyard threatens...

stalking rust eats through
the outer coating, the shine
is fading even in underwater
bursts the sky is hovering
like a doomed ceiling -

The agency noted the
smell of damp wood -
and the need to constantly
return to the color blue -

the smile is tinted with
sad shreds from the bulky
waste of keeping up
with the timeline -

There are hints, in 
split-screen scenes
of how it feels to 
be sawn apart -

helplessly exposed
to the heat from hordes,
the magic is chipped off,
but the seating is intact -

We give until November
to tie the knot
otherwise it will all end up
in the scrap dealers...

	
sugar
-----

well, gentlemen, my feeling 

is entirely against such nonsense -

not exactly being a model, eighteen

is yet an early age -

within my own experiences, i have

encountered that magic as still vital

and daresay it was even a type of salvation!

while it is true that there was a pushy

sort of bossiness, even for a Germanic,

it did not make me feel manipulated -

my only concern is the nearly direct

references to incident ily and so forth

not to mention name dropping

from the 1991 rolodex 

like already a partner...

still, in a most telling moment,

the suggestion to nap instead

of plowing through the sluggish afternoon

rejuvenated my emotions and

led me into dreams which otherwise

would have been lost -

one 
july 2024

idol didnt get enough
credit for queens and
kings of the underground...

2014...

Jonesy said, "Bill, 
	don't be profound
If you are still a
king of the underground"	

i don;t apologize, 
for the weird transitions...

these notes simply contiune
to carry on from dreamweaver
and some writings before then;

it is not linear and not meant 
to be, it's only my reflections
in a sense...

monday now, i got one more
track done, it's entitled;
"lotta learns about 
the birds and the bees"
in e flat - 
the lyrics are from the
reality show question
we all loved...
'is this chicken that i have
or is it fish...i know it's
fish but it says chicken
by the sea'

(in response to her surprise
at cat calling men...)

i dreamt i was underwater,
i'm sure it was emilee
but i kept thinking of
the burne jones painting
the depths of the sea...

yes i heard some things
about the debate,

but two questions pop up -

why was kennedy left out

even if only out of respect

for for jfk...
	
and why is everyone acting

as if the so called president

can't act ie what if that is

his act, the flimflam, a fake

i forget what i am saying

and i get tired bla bla bla...

oh snap le pen put placed it

deep inside le'macron -

da doo ron ron, nebraska

i can't really say i am surprised...

i was surprised by four fast guns

brett hasley playng johnny naco

you think mouths are only for talking...

a family affair, three of my favorite

actresses all in one rom com room!

two hours that feel like one...

then i dreamt i was in cathedral

parkway, perhaps getting something

for mother, interrupted at hallway

staircase east - a soft drink and a

a hard face - i suppose it lead to

me taking some extra time to clean

house here today...lotta said

she deep cleaned...

i like her influence. 

nothing from emilee except

a feeling, but how do i distinguish

emotion from memory...
