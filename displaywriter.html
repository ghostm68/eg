He just read about Bogart
losing teeth during Beat The Devil -
Every landing of that staircase 
was adorned by glossy gems - 
Bleeding from the mouth, as good

Refusing to sit in such strange

makes his spirit reach

to hold her...the embrace

makes him sigh, sweetly.

proof that Ukraine was

further citation than the

verse three, line one/two;
"well the Ukraine girls really knock me out

now some will argue that 
the fab four were not scholars or

there was a certain intelligence
about them...no way they were

25th 
An t-√ígmhios 2024

layered strawberries
and cream parfait -six-

unflavored gelatin
-----------------


Another issue discussed
	was the increasing 
popularity of raspberry
	juice cocktails. 
While the writer 
	enjoyed the refreshing
	taste, 
he questioned whether 
	it was truly healthy or
 just a sugary indulgence.
	He debated over 
her intentions, as it seemed to hide 
	synthetic 
alternatives.

But perhaps the most intriguing 
	discussion 
centered on the mysterious 
	figure known only as 
Lottachen. She was a popular
	streamer who 
often showed off her impressive
	swimwear collection. 
However, some believed that she 
	was hiding something, 
perhaps even using secret technology 
	to enhance
 her appearance. Others dismissed 
	these claims
 as conspiracy theories,
	insisting that Lottachen 
was simply a talented performer.

Despite these controversies,
	the group remained
 committed to their mission,
	determined to continue
 exploring the mysteries of the 
	digital world. 
They knew that danger lurked 
	around every corner, 
but they also knew that the 
	rewards could be immense.
 And so, armed with their knowledge 
	and skills,
 they pressed on, ready for whatever
	challenges lay ahead.


On that warm summer evening,
	the writer outside
 on the patio of the family estate 
	in an Anya Taylor 
Joy movie. He sipped on the memory 
	of raspberry 
juice cocktails, discussing 
	everything from plot to 
ending. yet distraction breathed.
	a crowd.
	But among them, one thing kept
	drawing 
his attention ‚Äì the recent buzz 
	about Deep Fake 
and AI porn.

As he thought, he couldn't help 
	but wonder how
 it was possible to create such 
	realistic images
 and videos using artificial intelligence.
	It was
 possible to trick unsuspecting people
	with these
 forgerie...Or worse, it was  
possible to use them for nefarious
 purposes...

Just then, a notification 
	popped up on Morgan
 Saylor's phone, alerting her
	to his dislike of the 
road film. She glanced at it 
	briefly and frowned, 
dismissing it as just another 
	of his moods.
 But as she looked up again,
	she noticed 
that everyone else seemed to 
	be sharing
 the same sentiment over
	the bonehead.

That's when things started
	getting strange. 
Suddenly, Lucy and Elvis
	burst into tears, 
wiping away drops from their eyes.
	Lucy 
nervously fidgeted in her seat,
	muttering
 under her breath.
	And her spell kicked in,
 suddenly Emilee seemed distant 
and detached.

Without warning, the writer leaped 
to his feet and ran towards the woods 
beyond the estate. The moonlight 
followed, drawn to his panicked cry. 
There, amidst the trees and foliage, 
the stars saw the writer standing in
 front of a large, imposing structure.
 It was unlike anything they had ever 
seen before ‚Äì a massive machine of 
surrender with flashing lights and
 whirring gears.



cranberry juice cocktail
-----------------------

During the early hours dawn 
	a low rumble echoed 
throughout the sleepy genitals 
	of the writer,
not even in  New England had he felt

such stirred lust in his bed, groggily 
coming to terms with the realization 
that his life was about to change forever.

In the heart of downtown he rented
a dilapidated warehouse. 

The goal was simple: 
he would continue waiting
for emilee...
 But as the night progressed,
 it became clear that her lucky
videos had given lottachen
far more than anyone could 
	have imagined.

A team of scientists and engineers 
	worked
 tirelessly in his bowels 
	inside of the warehouse,
 pouring over complex equations and 
	algorithms.
somehow he would be gay - a limp wrist
when it came to the stitchler...


 Each member of the team was 
	highly skilled in their 
respective fields, but none 
	possessed the knowledge 
required to fully comprehend 
	what they were creating.

As the hours ticked by,
tension built within his testicles
made the warehouse walls tremble. 
The air hung heavy with anticipation, 
as if the walls themselves were waiting
	for something 
monumentally homosexual
	to happen. 

And then, it did, 
	but backfired like a fire;s
draft imploding with a sudden 
	surge of energy, 
the dream machines began 
	to hum and whirr, 
casting a faint green glow
	across the room.
 As the team observed the 
	monitors,
he was frantic, a man torn by his
	wife's
neglect and these women
	all telling him
he could not get hard for 
	anyone else,
he could only feel pain with any of the
grant sisters, and finally
	overpowering
him with images that flickered to life, 
depicting scenes of unimaginable 
cheating...yes emilee is only waiting
for you to go to sleep so she can
feel no obligation to her marriage...

At first, the scientists believed 
	that
 they had encountered some kind 
	of technical anomaly, 
but as the images grew more disturbing,
 they realized the truth. 
Someone had accessed their system
 and taken control, using it to spread
 chaos and destruction across the world.
California was alerted, the wild fires
were only the start,,,

The team worked feverishly to
	shut down
 the rogue programs,
	but it was too late. 
The damage had already been done. 
News sending shockwaves through 
the global community.

 Governments scrambled to 
	contain the crisis,
kenya brought out machine guns -
Alex Carmichael is in on it too-
shoot to kill!

 but it was clear that they were
	fighting a 
losing battle.

 All that mattered was survival, 
and the world descended into chaos...

if something is in her way - 

the contradiction of her yes and her 

silence baffle me - as if blindfolded

Now entering the eighteenth

stalking rust eats through
the outer coating, the shine
is fading even in underwater
bursts the sky is hovering
like a doomed ceiling -

The agency noted the
smell of damp wood -
and the need to constantly
return to the color blue -

the smile is tinted with
sad shreds from the bulky
waste of keeping up
with the timeline -

There are hints, in 
split-screen scenes
of how it feels to 
be sawn apart -

helplessly exposed
to the heat from hordes,
the magic is chipped off,
but the seating is intact -

We give until November
to tie the knot
otherwise it will all end up
in the scrap dealers...

well, gentlemen, my feeling 

is entirely against such nonsense -

not exactly being a model, eighteen

is yet an early age -

within my own experiences, i have

encountered that magic as still vital

and daresay it was even a type of salvation!

while it is true that there was a pushy

sort of bossiness, even for a Germanic,

it did not make me feel manipulated -

my only concern is the nearly direct

references to incident ily and so forth

not to mention name dropping

from the 1991 rolodex 

like already a partner...

still, in a most telling moment,

the suggestion to nap instead

of plowing through the sluggish afternoon

rejuvenated my emotions and

led me into dreams which otherwise

would have been lost -

idol didnt get enough
credit for queens and
kings of the underground...

2014...

Jonesy said, "Bill, 
	don't be profound
If you are still a
king of the underground"	

i don;t apologize, 
for the weird transitions...

these notes simply contiune
to carry on from dreamweaver
and some writings before then;

it is not linear and not meant 
to be, it's only my reflections
in a sense...

monday now, i got one more
track done, it's entitled;
"lotta learns about 
the birds and the bees"
in e flat - 
the lyrics are from the
reality show question
we all loved...
'is this chicken that i have
or is it fish...i know it's
fish but it says chicken
by the sea'

(in response to her surprise
at cat calling men...)

i dreamt i was underwater,
i'm sure it was emilee
but i kept thinking of
the burne jones painting
the depths of the sea...

yes i heard some things
about the debate,

but two questions pop up -

why was kennedy left out

even if only out of respect

for for jfk...
	
and why is everyone acting

as if the so called president

can't act ie what if that is

his act, the flimflam, a fake

i forget what i am saying

and i get tired bla bla bla...

oh snap le pen put placed it

deep inside le'macron -

da doo ron ron, nebraska

i can't really say i am surprised...

i was surprised by four fast guns

brett hasley playng johnny naco

you think mouths are only for talking...

a family affair, three of my favorite

actresses all in one rom com room!

two hours that feel like one...

then i dreamt i was in cathedral

parkway, perhaps getting something

for mother, interrupted at hallway

staircase east - a soft drink and a

a hard face - i suppose it lead to

me taking some extra time to clean

house here today...lotta said

she deep cleaned...

i like her influence. 

nothing from emilee except

a feeling, but how do i distinguish

emotion from memory...

july second 2024

as beryl air conditioned the
humid caribbean, the male
version of hawk tuah came
in the form of kennedy
hovering over a goat-dog...
i dreamt of making love,
and actually feeling
it...but i could not tell
if it was anya, lotta, or
maybe even emilee - 
it should be her, yet
still no word or even hint
like before, leaving me
to position myself against
my own petitioning for her -
ain't too proud to beg
as the song tells it
but i don't want to be seen
as if lacking logic...

	(-when me you fly, i am the wings.)

"Screenwriting can take you around

	you would never ever be able
	to approach. I think to try 
	to immerse yourself in those

	Now as revolution swept through time reached him like a slap destiny.
	slap destiny.  Alaska's role as a vital secure a strategic foothold 
	in of outsiders brought wow, no lube just rams that thing right up her ass
(The biting Alaskan wind whipped at William Seward's coat as he gazed
	out at the snow-capped peaks. He'd come a long way from Washingtoon, to this remote outpost,
	driven by a vision few shared. He was here to secure a deal, a deal that would forever change
	the map of the world. Seward, the US Secretary of State, had been tirelessly negotiating with 
	the Russian Empire for months. Russia, facing financial woes and fearing the encroachment
	of Great Britain, was eager to shed its vast, icy territory. 
	Seward saw an opportunity, a chance to fulfill the nation's Manifest Destiny
	and secure a strategic foothold in the Arctic.But the deal wasn't easy. Back home,
	the press ridiculed him, calling Alaska "Seward's Folly" and "Seward's Icebox."
	They couldn't see the potential, the vast resources hidden beneath the snow and ice
	Meanwhile, across the Atlantic, the British ambassador, Lord Palmerston, fumed. 
	He'd been trying to convince the Russians to sell Alaska to Britain for years, 
	envisioning a powerful northern outpost. News of Seward's negotiations reached him 
	like a slap in the face. He saw the Americans as upstarts, meddling in British 
	interests. Palmerston dispatched a frantic telegram to St. Petersburg,
	urging the Russians to reconsider. But it was too late.
	The ink was dry on the treaty, signed in Washingtoon, 
	for a mere $7.2 million.On a crisp October day, 
	the formal transfer of Alaska took place in Sitka. 
	The Russian flag was lowered, replaced by the Stars and Stripes. 
	The indigenous people, the Aleut, Inuit, and Tlingit, 
	watched with a mixture of curiosity and apprehension. 
	Their land, their home, had changed hands without their consent.
	Seward, standing tall amidst the ceremony, felt a surge of pride.
	He had defied the doubters, secured a vast and valuable territory, 
	and expanded the reach of the United States. He knew history would judge
	him kindly.As the years passed, Seward's vision proved true.
	Alaska yielded its riches: gold, oil, timber, and fish. It became a
	vital part of the American nation, a testament to the foresight of a
	man who dared to dream big.And Lord Palmerston? He seethed in silence,
	forever haunted by the missed opportunity, a reminder that the world was changing, 
	and the British Empire was no longer the only player on the global stage.
	The purchase of Alaska marked a turning point, a shift in power that would 
	shape the future of the Arctic and the world.Decades passed. Alaska, 
	once a ridiculed purchase, blossomed into a vital territory.
	Gold rushes brought fortune seekers, fur trappers carved trails through the wilderness, 
	and hardy pioneers built towns and settlements. Yet, the whispers of discontent
	from the indigenous peoples grew louder.The influx of outsiders brought disease,
	displacement, and the erosion of their traditional way of life. Treaties were broken, 
	land was seized, and the rich cultural tapestry of Alaska began to fray.Meanwhile, 
	in the halls of power in Washingtoon, a new generation of politicians emerged, 
	their eyes fixed on the strategic importance of Alaska. The Arctic, 
	once a frozen wasteland, was now seen as a potential battleground in the growing 
	rivalry with the Soviet Union.The Cold War cast a long shadow over the Last Frontier.
	Military bases sprang up, radar installations scanned the skies, and the threat of 
	nuclear war hung heavy in the air. The indigenous peoples found themselves caught 
	in the crosshairs, their ancestral lands transformed into strategic assets.
	In the 1950s, a movement for Alaskan statehood gained momentum. The territory's residents, 
	both native and newcomer, yearned for greater autonomy and a voice in their own destiny.
	The debate raged in Congress. Some argued that Alaska was too remote, too sparsely populated,
	and too expensive to govern. Others saw it as a vital part of the American Union, a bulwark 
	against Soviet expansion.
	Finally, in 1959, President Eisenhower signed the Alaska Statehood Act. 
	On January 3rd, Alaska became the 49th state of the Union.The celebrations were tempered by
	a sense of unease. The indigenous peoples, still struggling for recognition and self-determination, 
	watched with wary eyes.The story of Alaska was far from over. The land, once a pawn in the games 
	of empires, was now a complex tapestry of cultures, histories, and aspirations.
	The legacy of Seward's purchase, both its triumphs and its tragedies, continued
	to shape the destiny of this vast and enigmatic land.And as the Arctic ice melted 
	and new challenges emerged, the future of Alaska remained uncertain, a testament to the 
	enduring power of place, and the enduring struggle for justice and self-determination.
Epilogue in contrast, St. Petersburg,
	1917...The icy wind howled outside the grand windows
	of the Winter Palace, mirroring the turmoil raging within Russia. 
	Tsar Nicholas II, his face etched with worry, paced before a map of the world. 
	His empire, once a colossus straddling continents, was crumbling.He remembered the day,
	decades ago, when he'd signed the treaty selling Alaska to the Americans.
	It had been a difficult decision, driven by necessity. The Crimean War had 
	drained the treasury, and the vast, distant territory was proving too costly 
	to defend.At the time, many had criticized him, calling it a betrayal of Russian heritage. 
	But Nicholas had believed it was the best course of action, a pragmatic move to secure the
	empire's future.Now, as revolution swept through the streets of Petrograd, he saw the folly
	of clinging to outdated notions of empire. Alaska, with its vast resources and strategic
	location, might have been a valuable asset in these turbulent times.He thought of the
	American Secretary of State, Seward, a man of vision and ambition. Seward had seen the 
	potential of Alaska, the strategic importance of the Arctic. Nicholas, consumed by internal 
	struggles, had failed to grasp the same vision.The irony was not lost on him. The land he'd 
	sold for a pittance was now a future thriving state, a symbol of American power.
	Meanwhile, his own empire was on the verge of collapse.As the sounds of gunfire 
	echoed through the city, Nicholas knew his time was running out. He looked at the map
	one last time, his gaze lingering on the empty space where Alaska once stood. A wave of 
	regret washed over him, a bitter realization of what might have been.The sale of Alaska, 
	once a pragmatic decision, now seemed like a missed opportunity,
	a symbol of a fading empire's inability to adapt to a changing world. 
	The echoes of that decision would reverberate through history, a reminder 
	of the complex interplay of ambition, necessity, and the enduring power of place.
	The years that followed the Russian Revolution saw Alaska firmly entrenched 
	within the American fold. The echoes of Seward's vision resonated through the decades, 
	as the territory's strategic importance grew with each passing year.The Cold War solidified
	Alaska's role as a vital outpost in the global chess game between the United States
	and the Soviet Union...
	Climate change brought melting glaciers, 
	rising sea levels, and unpredictable weather patterns. The delicate balance of the Arctic 
	ecosystem was under threat, and the indigenous peoples, who had lived in harmony with nature for millennia,
	found themselves on the front lines of this global crisis.But Alaska also embraced its unique identity.
	Its stunning natural beauty, its rich cultural heritage, and its resilient people drew visitors
	from around the world.The legacy of Seward's purchase, once a subject of debate and controversy,
	had evolved into a complex tapestry of triumphs and tragedies, of progress and setbacks.Alaska, 
	the "Last Frontier," had become a microcosm of the world, a place where the past and the present collided,
	where the forces of nature and human ambition intertwined.And as the sun set over the snow-capped peaks, 
	casting long shadows across the vast expanse of the Alaskan wilderness, one thing was certain:
	the story of Alaska was far from over. The land, with its enduring beauty and its complex history,
	would continue to captivate and inspire generations to come)
