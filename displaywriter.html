i get up
from a lottery
dream, someone
wants to wager
on a number,
as i hear the talk
my thoughts take
me elsewhere, a
a beach at sunset...
a hotel room, and
back into the scene -
which itself was not
interesting...
sun cough water lie fly
bird tits snake with what souls he -
married yet out of sight
out of mind...
a guess trembles
my patience weeps

settled into sleep
i dream that i am
having a recurring dream
with emilee -
i even awake in the scene
thinking to note it -
notice i am sleeping,
the weirdest drug -
she's next to me,
a screen with an anchor
power puff telecaster...
(maybe wishing for murder
suits me)

it is pointless to chase
a dream that is not her
aim yet i sustain my
vow, by chance
the enforcer
spirals me into 
a mind bending titty fuck 
alivia, please get out of the sun...
i slumber until six
(lynch plays with a monkey)
i postulate that peter gabriel

cat and news make details
vanish, yet i adore
that dream of her, yes 
how i love her.

22nd tjugoett 2024

layered strawberries
and cream parfait -two-

unflavored gelatin
-----------------

plural calves

never calfs

all day pulse

unknown

still up in the

morning the

electricity cut

party to pay

court tattoo anime

i climb into another cab

pulse now pains inner thigh

a moveable south east



cranberry juice cocktail
-----------------------

lights camera at three

keira had made it erotic

i studied lotte pictures

i wanted to suck

morgan saylor's tits

of course only wrote

her a note, fan mail -

when the going gets

tough the tough fangirl -

in Swedish fan is a 

multiple meaning word

usually fuck, what have

you done to me emilee?



	
sugar
-----

it's a mad mad world

butcher Arkansas four dice

loaded three dead

the ap picture window

like bird droppings

i need to pick up after

the cat -

instead i procrastinate

smoke heat up the left ovrs

can't get anywhere with you

or blow the man down -

interview from bygone days

miss grant even felt

at a turn of word




strawberry extract
-----------------

there's a breeze 

even rain, 

i run to sleep

i walk in slumber

through city streets

grey is the color of your

only friend, hey alice

or is it still keira

since i told her about you -

a Chinese man tells me

i have mispronounced

四川菜

faraway in Chongqing 

i imagine they are laughing

at me - a laughing stock

i enter the magazine shop

but emilee is working 

and i hardly take a glance

feeling unkempt - confused,

(like miller with acne

missed meeting lennon)

and partly as if i have cheated

her by scrolling through

media social awaking 

near midnight




sliced strawberries
------------------

sha na na Shannon

no shirt silk lake blue bra

says she doesn't see her

snapchats Instagram twitter

message her elsewhere...

hardcore two reindeer sheets

Hollywood met mirror met

bend over 

reece and clara might have

broken up

two lesbian beautiful

i hoped it wasn't my seduction

impossible she had beamed

at my grin

quote the caption; "i know you

just got done knocking up our

little girl but please dump a load

into me, daddy" wholesome

and topless 

or so the report read,

cum addicted	




	
whipped topping
------------
.
here here, to spanish bitch,

tamia alvarez, involved

in a frantic attack nearly

as bad as porn incest jokes -

mister busha alrlene bialic...

born in denville died in stanhope

samantha if molly ann drlik

is not with us then who will

deliver the anesthesia...

layered strawberries
and cream parfait -three-

unflavored gelatin
-----------------

He could neither explain, not in any 
coherent fashion, his dream nor
how awfully dirty his jacuzzi
could get in a couple of days -

Thick wood steps, the type which
has seen a lot of neglect, he looks
at the word neglet wondering what
is wrong...What is a pirate's favorite
letter, sure you'd think r, but it is
c...Recent tik tok slap stick -
There's a man, nothing unusual
or attractive about him...Giving
a speech of some sort he cannot
hear - He leaves and returns only
to leave again in fright as the 
man's mouth bleeds blood -
He just read about Bogart
losing teeth during Beat The Devil -
Every landing of that staircase 
was adorned by glossy gems - 
Bleeding from the mouth, as good
as dead - a Dylan line, Tempest,
was it...

Refusing to sit in such strange
waters, he squats for a minute -
had he been sleep walking into
a mud wrestling match and
slipped in to scrub off...





cranberry juice cocktail
-----------------------

setting up inkrealm.info/66

takes the afternoon...

not to mention someone

jiggled the meta tag

to read featuring videos

of Alexandra Carmichael...

he wondered, was this the

weirdness...or even; was 

someone masked as him

trying to use her...

cover model, world 

& after world...

he takes a bit more time

to fix the code...then 

switch passwords

for GitHub & gmail...

the side effects of lotta

make him mop the

headquarters -

stitchler, that is...

he finally gets

blow the man down -

sort of like reading

tough guys don't dance...

he thinks for a second,

not a dog or a cat in the 

whole town...

turkey sandwich

drowsy into nap

but somehow finding

emilee in his imagination

makes his spirit reach

through space and time

to hold her...the embrace

makes him sigh, sweetly.

white album's opening track;

verse three, line one/two;
"well the Ukraine girls really knock me out
they leave the west behind"

now some will argue that 
the fab four were not scholars or
historians, but we all know 
there was a certain intelligence
about them...no way they were
wrong...it is a simple fact.



strawberry extract
-----------------

donny poppy sprinkle
is it possible to 
danny boy your testicles
chase lenhoff
louie oh smith
silvano marchetto

of wanting to push
that boat out onto
curling waves...

whipped topping
------------

 Sat in my place?
	
to own the distortion! seed.
Here so it bent: accounts 
 retrieve the misdeed hack the misdeed
 insect gnawed gnarled as my meta tag hunts

warped to your worst: 
 Crime to doom dealt proved 
 bill mere bite of the wise first
 recognized bite again moved

into faulty scars
an itch none may scratch.
or did you want a merit badge?
this curse reattaches like a death-match
sun to mars!

layered strawberries
and cream parfait -three-

unflavored gelatin

  My head was him trying woman?
 Heavy spinning ... 
  your confusion your shyness;
 went home  quickly 
before my wife
 and damn happy

 I have not met. 
that picture. 

	
sugar

erection
 protruded from a side pocket. ... 
 loaded with cherry stones ... 
 handkerchief: nose
accustomed to slip;
lotta's cleaning
burning like fire on horseback; 
My wife' continued to us;
 I will introduce you under Alexandra
 this cap  sitting in 
 Suddenly the door 




strawberry extract
-----------------

as the hair had blonde 
 turned two tickets; 
 I said to her -
 Are you ready?
 restive traveling
 to me
 was the way
still a 
 locked door
 I  pointed 
at immortality


sliced strawberries
------------------

dream i cannot tell -

swelling thoughts

burst as it vanished

the bath now clean

howevever and the

meal made nap

steak rice all while

waiting for

aka we the coyotes

so i watched

the guggenheim/stix

reel called

the great st louis bank robbery

not bad...
