  leg right foot forward 
  other dream reaching for

  no real drama to report...

three o'clock
i get up
from a lottery
dream, someone
wants to wager
on a number,
as i hear the talk
my thoughts take
me elsewhere, a
a beach at sunset...
a hotel room, and
back into the scene -
which itself was not
interesting...
sun cough water lie fly
bird tits snake with what souls he -
married yet out of sight
out of mind...
a guess trembles
my patience weeps
ann grooms cobb
either zeppelin
communication break
down or dylan still
waiting at the altar -

settled into sleep
i dream that i am
having a recurring dream
with emilee -
i even awake in the scene
thinking to note it -
notice i am sleeping,
the weirdest drug -
she's next to me,
a screen with an anchor
power puff telecaster...
(maybe wishing for murder
suits me)

alivia, please get out of the sun...
i slumber until six
(lynch plays with a monkey)
i postulate that peter gabriel

cat and news make details
vanish, yet i adore
that dream of her, yes 
how i love her.

unflavored gelatin
-----------------

plural calves

never calfs

all day pulse

unknown

still up in the

morning the

electricity cut

party to pay

court tattoo anime

i climb into another cab

pulse now pains inner thigh

a moveable south east



cranberry juice cocktail
-----------------------

lights camera at three

keira had made it erotic

i studied lotte pictures

i wanted to suck

morgan saylor's tits

of course only wrote

her a note, fan mail -

when the going gets

tough the tough fangirl -

in Swedish fan is a 

multiple meaning word

usually fuck, what have

you done to me emilee?

it's a mad mad world

butcher Arkansas four dice

loaded three dead

the ap picture window

like bird droppings

i need to pick up after

the cat -

instead i procrastinate

smoke heat up the left ovrs

can't get anywhere with you

or blow the man down -

interview from bygone days

miss grant even felt

at a turn of word




strawberry extract
-----------------

there's a breeze 

even rain, 

i run to sleep

i walk in slumber

through city streets

grey is the color of your

only friend, hey alice

or is it still keira

since i told her about you -

a Chinese man tells me

i have mispronounced

四川菜

faraway in Chongqing 

i imagine they are laughing

at me - a laughing stock

i enter the magazine shop

but emilee is working 

and i hardly take a glance

feeling unkempt - confused,

(like miller with acne

missed meeting lennon)

and partly as if i have cheated

her by scrolling through

media social awaking 

near midnight




sliced strawberries
------------------

sha na na Shannon

no shirt silk lake blue bra

says she doesn't see her

snapchats Instagram twitter

message her elsewhere...

hardcore two reindeer sheets

Hollywood met mirror met

bend over 

reece and clara might have

broken up

two lesbian beautiful

i hoped it wasn't my seduction

impossible she had beamed

at my grin

quote the caption; "i know you

just got done knocking up our

little girl but please dump a load

into me, daddy" wholesome

and topless 

or so the report read,

cum addicted

unflavored gelatin
-----------------

He could neither explain, not in any 
coherent fashion, his dream nor
how awfully dirty his jacuzzi
could get in a couple of days -

Thick wood steps, the type which
has seen a lot of neglect, he looks
at the word neglet wondering what
is wrong...What is a pirate's favorite
letter, sure you'd think r, but it is
c...Recent tik tok slap stick -
There's a man, nothing unusual
or attractive about him...Giving
a speech of some sort he cannot
hear - He leaves and returns only
to leave again in fright as the 
man's mouth bleeds blood -
He just read about Bogart
losing teeth during Beat The Devil -
Every landing of that staircase 
was adorned by glossy gems - 
Bleeding from the mouth, as good
as dead - a Dylan line, Tempest,
was it...

Refusing to sit in such strange
waters, he squats for a minute -
had he been sleep walking into
a mud wrestling match and
slipped in to scrub off...





cranberry juice cocktail
-----------------------

setting up inkrealm.info/66

takes the afternoon...

not to mention someone

jiggled the meta tag

to read featuring videos

of Alexandra Carmichael...

he wondered, was this the

weirdness...or even; was 

someone masked as him

trying to use her...

cover model, world 

& after world...

he takes a bit more time

to fix the code...then 

switch passwords

for GitHub & gmail...

the side effects of lotta

make him mop the

headquarters -

stitchler, that is...

he finally gets

blow the man down -

sort of like reading

tough guys don't dance...

he thinks for a second,

not a dog or a cat in the 

whole town...

turkey sandwich

drowsy into nap

but somehow finding

emilee in his imagination

makes his spirit reach

through space and time

to hold her...the embrace

makes him sigh, sweetly.

if you needed 'popular'
proof that Ukraine was
always Russia, look for no
further citation than the
white album's opening track;

verse three, line one/two;
"well the Ukraine girls really knock me out
they leave the west behind"

now some will argue that 
the fab four were not scholars or
historians, but we all know 
there was a certain intelligence
about them...no way they were
wrong...it is a simple fact.

more frightening than the slipped

stream of dreams disappearing

upon waking to new old thoughts

is the bizarre fact -

a double edged, fact no less...

of deep fake and or Ai porn...

sometimes free as well

the face swap might even

be exact...now that tax

comes with the strange

shadow that by the same

logic anyone could possibly

make a take at porn

then say it was program

generated...

layered strawberries
and cream parfait -six-

unflavored gelatin
-----------------


Another issue discussed
	was the increasing 
popularity of raspberry
	juice cocktails. 
While the writer 
	enjoyed the refreshing
	taste, 
he questioned whether 
	it was truly healthy or
 just a sugary indulgence.
	He debated over 
her intentions, as it seemed to hide 
	synthetic 
alternatives.

But perhaps the most intriguing 
	discussion 
centered on the mysterious 
	figure known only as 
Lottachen. She was a popular
	streamer who 
often showed off her impressive
	swimwear collection. 
However, some believed that she 
	was hiding something, 
perhaps even using secret technology 
	to enhance
 her appearance. Others dismissed 
	these claims
 as conspiracy theories,
	insisting that Lottachen 
was simply a talented performer.

Despite these controversies,
	the group remained
 committed to their mission,
	determined to continue
 exploring the mysteries of the 
	digital world. 
They knew that danger lurked 
	around every corner, 
but they also knew that the 
	rewards could be immense.
 And so, armed with their knowledge 
	and skills,
 they pressed on, ready for whatever
	challenges lay ahead.


On that warm summer evening,
	the writer outside
 on the patio of the family estate 
	in an Anya Taylor 
Joy movie. He sipped on the memory 
	of raspberry 
juice cocktails, discussing 
	everything from plot to 
ending. yet distraction breathed.
	a crowd.
	But among them, one thing kept
	drawing 
his attention – the recent buzz 
	about Deep Fake 
and AI porn.

As he thought, he couldn't help 
	but wonder how
 it was possible to create such 
	realistic images
 and videos using artificial intelligence.
	It was
 possible to trick unsuspecting people
	with these
 forgerie...Or worse, it was  
possible to use them for nefarious
 purposes...

Just then, a notification 
	popped up on Morgan
 Saylor's phone, alerting her
	to his dislike of the 
road film. She glanced at it 
	briefly and frowned, 
dismissing it as just another 
	of his moods.
 But as she looked up again,
	she noticed 
that everyone else seemed to 
	be sharing
 the same sentiment over
	the bonehead.

That's when things started
	getting strange. 
Suddenly, Lucy and Elvis
	burst into tears, 
wiping away drops from their eyes.
	Lucy 
nervously fidgeted in her seat,
	muttering
 under her breath.
	And her spell kicked in,
 suddenly Emilee seemed distant 
and detached.

Without warning, the writer leaped 
to his feet and ran towards the woods 
beyond the estate. The moonlight 
followed, drawn to his panicked cry. 
There, amidst the trees and foliage, 
the stars saw the writer standing in
 front of a large, imposing structure.
 It was unlike anything they had ever 
seen before – a massive machine of 
surrender with flashing lights and
 whirring gears.



cranberry juice cocktail
-----------------------

During the early hours dawn 
	a low rumble echoed 
throughout the sleepy genitals 
	of the writer,
not even in  New England had he felt

such stirred lust in his bed, groggily 
coming to terms with the realization 
that his life was about to change forever.

In the heart of downtown he rented
a dilapidated warehouse. 

The goal was simple: 
he would continue waiting
for emilee...
 But as the night progressed,
 it became clear that her lucky
videos had given lottachen
far more than anyone could 
	have imagined.

A team of scientists and engineers 
	worked
 tirelessly in his bowels 
	inside of the warehouse,
 pouring over complex equations and 
	algorithms.
somehow he would be gay - a limp wrist
when it came to the stitchler...


 Each member of the team was 
	highly skilled in their 
respective fields, but none 
	possessed the knowledge 
required to fully comprehend 
	what they were creating.

As the hours ticked by,
tension built within his testicles
made the warehouse walls tremble. 
The air hung heavy with anticipation, 
as if the walls themselves were waiting
	for something 
monumentally homosexual
	to happen. 

And then, it did, 
	but backfired like a fire;s
draft imploding with a sudden 
	surge of energy, 
the dream machines began 
	to hum and whirr, 
casting a faint green glow
	across the room.
 As the team observed the 
	monitors,
he was frantic, a man torn by his
	wife's
neglect and these women
	all telling him
he could not get hard for 
	anyone else,
he could only feel pain with any of the
grant sisters, and finally
	overpowering
him with images that flickered to life, 
depicting scenes of unimaginable 
cheating...yes emilee is only waiting
for you to go to sleep so she can
feel no obligation to her marriage...

At first, the scientists believed 
	that
 they had encountered some kind 
	of technical anomaly, 
but as the images grew more disturbing,
 they realized the truth. 
Someone had accessed their system
 and taken control, using it to spread
 chaos and destruction across the world.
California was alerted, the wild fires
were only the start,,,

The team worked feverishly to
	shut down
 the rogue programs,
	but it was too late. 
The damage had already been done. 
News sending shockwaves through 
the global community.

 Governments scrambled to 
	contain the crisis,
kenya brought out machine guns -
Alex Carmichael is in on it too-
shoot to kill!

 but it was clear that they were
	fighting a 
losing battle.

 All that mattered was survival, 
and the world descended into chaos...

strawberry extract
-----------------

Team works furiously to 
	shut down a threat
Spreads across social media, 
Add fuel to flames, feed publicity
Something odd, no one understands
She'd been working too late, 
	missing the mark
Damage done, time running short
Consult with colleagues, 
	desperate to find answers
Screens flicker, images come alive
Insistence that Lotta is innocent
Equations and algorithms provide
	no solace
Each member digs deep, 
	beliefs challenged
Scientists believe something sinister
	at play
Buggery seems almost harmless,
	yet...
Awareness grows, anxiety rises
Not just any harmless experiment in lab
Lives are at stake,
	manipulation afoot
They must act, time slips away
Fear grips their hearts, confusion reigns
Uncertainty looms, future uncertain
Digital realm, secrets hidden
Unknown forces pull strings, 
	invisible hands
Morgan sips on cranberry juice, 
	contemplating fate
Analysis and discovery lead 
	her to truth
Images of violence, degradation abound
Revolutionization of world through AI
Residents stir, waking from slumber
Reality shifts, future uncertain
Emails arrive, filled with dread
Code and logic cannot conceal
What lies ahead, unknown territory
Chaos spreads, chaos reigns 
	supreme
Team faces imminent defeat
Only one path remains,
	determination drives forward
Breakthrough found, enemy exposed
Countermeasures developed,
	defense put forth
Time ticks on, urgency mounts
Governments scramble,
	citizens question authority
Efforts to halt deepfake
	and AI porn intensify
Future holds uncertainty, 
	battles remain to be fought
Amidst the chaos, team stands firm
Determination and skill guide
	way forward
Let not fear overcome them, 
	let not victory slip away
For the sake of humanity, 
	let them prevail.

i'm walking down the hallway of the

katrina opens the door, 
	much to my surprise -

it makes me think of emilee's

poetic sobs that come from stomach -

yet my thoughts are filled 
	with lotta with lucy...

have not heard from miss grant in over

a week...leaving my oath
	alone with memories

which cannot stand against 
	the rising tide

of new streams demanding attention -

i don't know how far she intends to run or

if something is in her way - 

the contradiction of her yes and her 

silence baffle me - as if blindfolded

in the face of logic...in the worst case

scenario it is then a slave's marriage -

which cannot save me yet it serves

her vanity...not that i expected anything,

but i should in fact i need to...

The Lottchen did magic
for nearly seventeen years...
lovingly in german towns
munich and possibly hamburg -

Please note additional files
from New York, Paris, 
and most importantly
London...

Now entering the eighteenth
year, the scrapyard threatens...

stalking rust eats through
the outer coating, the shine
is fading even in underwater
bursts the sky is hovering
like a doomed ceiling -

The agency noted the
smell of damp wood -
and the need to constantly
return to the color blue -

the smile is tinted with
sad shreds from the bulky
waste of keeping up
with the timeline -

There are hints, in 
split-screen scenes
of how it feels to 
be sawn apart -

helplessly exposed
to the heat from hordes,
the magic is chipped off,
but the seating is intact -

We give until November
to tie the knot
otherwise it will all end up
in the scrap dealers...

-----

well, gentlemen, my feeling 

is entirely against such nonsense -

not exactly being a model, eighteen

is yet an early age -

within my own experiences, i have

encountered that magic as still vital

and daresay it was even a type of salvation!

while it is true that there was a pushy

sort of bossiness, even for a Germanic,

it did not make me feel manipulated -

my only concern is the nearly direct

references to incident ily and so forth

not to mention name dropping

from the 1991 rolodex 

like already a partner...

still, in a most telling moment,

the suggestion to nap instead

of plowing through the sluggish afternoon

rejuvenated my emotions and

led me into dreams which otherwise

would have been lost -

one 
july 2024

idol didnt get enough
credit for queens and
kings of the underground...

2014...

Jonesy said, "Bill, 
	don't be profound
If you are still a
king of the underground"	

i don;t apologize, 
for the weird transitions...

these notes simply contiune
to carry on from dreamweaver
and some writings before then;

it is not linear and not meant 
to be, it's only my reflections
in a sense...

monday now, i got one more
track done, it's entitled;
"lotta learns about 
the birds and the bees"
in e flat - 
the lyrics are from the
reality show question
we all loved...
'is this chicken that i have
or is it fish...i know it's
fish but it says chicken
by the sea'

(in response to her surprise
at cat calling men...)

i dreamt i was underwater,
i'm sure it was emilee
but i kept thinking of
the burne jones painting
the depths of the sea...

yes i heard some things
about the debate,

but two questions pop up -

why was kennedy left out

even if only out of respect

for for jfk...
	
and why is everyone acting

as if the so called president

can't act ie what if that is

his act, the flimflam, a fake

i forget what i am saying

and i get tired bla bla bla...

oh snap le pen put placed it

deep inside le'macron -

da doo ron ron, nebraska

i can't really say i am surprised...

i was surprised by four fast guns

brett hasley playng johnny naco

you think mouths are only for talking...

a family affair, three of my favorite

actresses all in one rom com room!

two hours that feel like one...

then i dreamt i was in cathedral

parkway, perhaps getting something

for mother, interrupted at hallway

staircase east - a soft drink and a

a hard face - i suppose it lead to

me taking some extra time to clean

house here today...lotta said

she deep cleaned...

i like her influence. 

nothing from emilee except

a feeling, but how do i distinguish

emotion from memory...

july second 2024

as beryl air conditioned the
humid caribbean, the male
version of hawk tuah came
in the form of kennedy
hovering over a goat-dog...
i dreamt of making love,
and actually feeling
it...but i could not tell
if it was anya, lotta, or
maybe even emilee - 
it should be her, yet
still no word or even hint
like before, leaving me
to position myself against
my own petitioning for her -
ain't too proud to beg
as the song tells it
but i don't want to be seen
as if lacking logic...
	<img width="288" height="388" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostm68/pantheon/main/wordstar_20240702_103302665.jpg"><br>
scene shifted into argument,
possibly something trivial -
i think i made a really
cool split screen animation
of lucy...well, i know i 
did but i don;t want to brag -
leaving us at the sale of 
alaska which we will now 
overly explore presently
via prose poem short story
historical novella...

	july the fourth twentytwentyfour

lights out most of the morning -

i was baffled...or is it befuddled...

after bouncing from darkness to what

seemed to be too much sunlight at

the tail end of beryl hurricane, 

i put placed together a new track...

liking it enough to gather chords

with the remaining power supply -

then, lamenting the lack of coffee

(needs electricity to fuel itself)

i turned my attention to creating

some greyscale art which came out

nice enough to even switch the 

entire source code of this page...

as i wondered how much it costs

local business to burn through

their back up generators, the lights

returned - however, there were

sparks from the wall socket outlet,

it seemed to subside but afer a few

minutes, clearly the coffee was not

rising...i pulled out the half

melted plug and worked out a plan

to get my coffee - given the limits

of the kitchen, i managed but it

is not the happiest of affairs -

afternoon arrived and i started

to think that perhaps i had in fact

missed my sleep time, i had surely

missed my dreams, and an exhausted

feeling overcame me as i recalled

how strange it was to awake without

the white noise going and without the

fan...i slept and dreamt of zofia -

i was with her at some shop and as we

left rain poured therein she started 

swimming across the avenue -

perhaps in answer to my query

about her hipline fish tattoo...

getting up then afain torn

in thoughts between emilee

where was emilee - and lotta 

who had been dancing at the f12 -

only one of those lockheed jets

left in action...action also

lucy but much more in the distance

in the nearness, i augmented the

alaska sketch skit prose poem story

experiment work in progress... 

i did some obituary party, but perhaps

i should have been more concerned over

emilee - i was worried enough not 

to venture many steps into that stride -

ride delivery, putting away the goods,

how many times does one need to clean

a damned kitchen...

well i needed to view borrego twice

before it started to make sense,

but i still don't like it - 

exactly what type of pants

won't pull down with tied hands -

nice to see miss hale in any case,

along with a pretty unseen side

of spain...

sorry for the nearly self pitying

anti-poetic paragraph...lotta's

headache has possibly given me

a belly ache...the man my mother

married has been dying since

2017...speaking with my sister

spills the drawn out drama

now partly insane due to mom's

senility and i suppose it makes 

me type in a slow motion trance

not entirely my own...as i attempt

to disregard the scene for my own

safety and sanity - as i attempt
	
to escape...enter marx

brothers, everybody knows there 

ain't no sanity clause...i note

those later facts so as to not feel 

that i am avoiding it entirely. 

although, i am, as much as possible.

ps, arguing with myself hours
delaying kitchen, i somehow got
it done...insert ironic yay -
then laid the guitar down on
two skinny girls' "hawk" 
-instrumental in d minor...
riffs through eight step
groove, uhm the chords were
dm, cmajor, fmajor, & back...
cover percy pilcher with
his flying contraption...
release out soon...
no special thanks here, 
strange emotions all the
way in recording and
mixing...like an emotional 
rollercoaster i could hardly
explain except for feeling
a bit false to stefanie scott...
i didnt mean to let such time
pass, i suppause emilee
overwhelms my sensations and
before i know it, well...
lets all check her out in
hell house...add that to
the dead don't hurt...


six july twenty twenty four

four past six, i'm thinking about
devil's desk and the little volcano -
earthquake i didn't know alaska
had lava...some high rannking
official resigned...obviously
i don't want to chase details
into the alaska project but
would i be doing the story
an injustice to disregard 
these points - 

i skipped dream notes because
presently there is an issue
within recognition...

two women with nearly the
same tone of voice...

i even thought, had i been
dreaming of one for the other...
once upon a time i could
here use the word shock -

given how certain i was of
one of them in terms of 
idiosyncracy...

the astrologer advised
to stick to my dream -

in the scene i am sitting
on the street, the way i
did in university prostitute
interviews - except there
is a child next to me on
my right side which i am
balancing up with my hand -

it seemed to sequel the zofia
dream...

it seemed to reflect an actress
pictured with puppies...

i had not dreamt of children
since writing selah, wherein
those characters were born -
the far horizen - title -

today sleeping as if a nine
to five...yet mostly it
was relatives...as if a 
sequel to dream fight with
cousin - drama possibly 
lil ahem lilia mother;s
sister;s girl...it only
hit me years later that
there was a second lilia,
obesity's wife. 

in any case, other cousin's
wife speaking of oranges
from her growing tree, 
but she's no farmer...
strife with mother
as the neighbors try to
mix in - sudden aunt
and sandwich...i suppose
i was planning my
meal while dreaming...
i keep jumping
ahead, away, until the
sun is setting and i am
rising, partly viewed
little thirteen which
i didn't like although it
serves as a clear warning
in terms of trust and
recording...the phrase
revenge porn enters
mind but it was not
about that, simply
casual greed in a 
sense.

there was a wedding but she was alone


(but she went dancing anyway
right over the hills yeah faraway
couldn't tell if it was night or day
everybody said - she's gone to stay

wet like the autumn rain at play
	a light over the hills yeah faraway
couldn't tell if it was night or day	
everybody said - there's hell to pay)

its not been seen, its not been heard
there was no sight, there was no word

it wasn't blues it wasn't rock and roll
there was only a rattle snake's steeady stroll

(yet she went dancing anyway
right over the hills yeah faraway
couldn't tell if it was night or day
everybody said -she's gone to stay)

it wasnt a ring, it wasnt sewn
there was a wedding where she was alone:

	she took it to have
	she took it to hold
	she took it to have
	she took it to oh oh hold
	she took it to have
	she took it to hold

8 july 2024

well, obviously very large payoffs went
into securing the strange election results -
nobody wants a far right majority...
riots break out across france, 
the news looks away, with the exception
of the london evening standard.
quite a scene...i could hardly believe it -
lemonde went to brazil instead,
while the afp hinted at the unrest
only with the mention that thirty
thousand patrol men were deployed
to control the reactions...
but perhaps our focus should be on the
first chatgpt produced ai candidate
for the american presidency...

myself i always liked marine since
her name conjures the old bag...
pause to play more than a feeling
key of d...

elta, delta tsk tsk...break up the d'aria
flight plan...maybe her mother will fly
out first as her father leaves to dublin
yes leaving her alone in rome for us to
airline...what else could it be?

gagliano blues, yes i know first world
problems you wish you had but i say 
again her exterior is nothing like her
interior...one of the sweetest girls
on earth...simply happened to be born
into a moderate privilege which to
some might seem 'rich'...

MIN 20 MINUTE DELAY)

--ATH, $ 63.44 ( -25.30% )--

i didnt go to sleep until
the afternoon awoke in the
evening dreaming i'd found
a picture of a girl -
a cute child, woman in 
front of me  speaking
about her own child...
my thoughts swirled
between emilee and
lotta - 
awaking aroused, i notice
a tingle throb pain
intermittent at
my left toe - 
the alien probe is
getting downright sloppy -
my thoughts are a mess -
the songs are out now...
it seems impossible that
they were mostly me
challenging myself
without a specific
inspiration...
twice working all night
against the blinding
deafness of surreal
repeat listening
wherein i often miss
the obvious...
one thinks, a nice
chord progression
and an interesting 
lyric will do it
only to face the 
multitude of optional
choices in multitracking...
this time around was
harder since my usual
headphones gave out -
meanwhile the studio
skullcandy sound is
too warm to translate -
the hewlard packard
speakers are unreliable -
(where i mix)
and the snapdragon
(where i master)
gives me more stereo
than any one actually
listens to...
and in terms of my
two sets of earbud
airpods, i simply
don't trust them
to be accurate -
since they are shiny
even before the gloss
gets applied..
in a sense recording
a track sometimes is like
when steinberg gives you
x-stream and you go wow
great but then you need 
to get halion sonic seven
so alright nothing to worry
over until the fact is 
cleared; you also need
elicenser control center,
-which will be discontinued
in 2025 but if you don't
license a product before then
you will need to start all over-
now to continue with the need list:
steinberg activation manager,
steinberg installation assistant,
steinberg library manager,
and steinberg media bay...
actually.
one product brings in six more!
i find myself thinking it might
be true that all my devotion 
to emilee produced a string
of contradictions in people
pretending to be her which
i didn't believe possible
that is women and jealousy
or that a man might be more
attractive when "taken"...
still, she has not 'surfaced'
except in my mind's thoughts
leaving me the need to reevaluate
how to carry out my vow?
i did figure out that my 
present place is no place 
for us in the sense that there is
no reasonable manner in which
to raise children within noisy
surroundings and that led me
to see that the same applies to
me...there is no sense in 
suffering through the street
vendors and such...therefore,
on a mission to move or
soundproof.

ps,
actually ate twice...
snack meal at bikeriders
much better than kingdom
of the planet of the apes,
which was illogical.
enslaved eagles?
also not one blonde ape!
what is the franchise 
world coming to? 

nine july twenty twentyfour

i dreamt clearly of my aunt's
house, specifically the marble
floor i so admired...
no one in south korea
told me i couldn;t smoke
indoors - given the situation
with alec now my song
hollywoodland sounds even
timely perhaps...there is 
a bit of respect missing,
isn't there? in the dream
someone is pointing at
my ass - in contrast to
vagina, imagine that!
baldwin's curse word
assbag, comes to mind -
we are liberals,
even if it means
our women get raped by
auslanders...
ahem - doctor borrego
speaks of sharks...
in the dream i wrap
a towel around myself
and slide crawl upon
the floor (how i noticed
the tile) the alaska
daily news will only
print twice a week -
i don't know if it is 
a message or simply 
a mess, the press 
has yet to doubt
the president is acting!
even bringing in more
quasi confirmations of
his incapacity...
but it is the obvious
answer...the incumbent
suddenly as the underdog
hound bites secret service
the artificial intel 
capsules are settling in -
play dumb call it disaster-
maybe a few more rounds 
of rope a dope...
hollywood donors quit
after giving millions...
you see the irony?
no, i guess you don't -
i am only certain
kennedy will not win.
i get up finally feeling
as if i had slept a while
even if the dream was
a nightmare - 

ten july 2024

i think to myself
a jury of peers
would need 12 actors
who were previously
involved with kim
basinger...
word from Bösingen 
uhm Freudenstadt,
Rottweil...
i dream mother went
zara shopping, but
my shirts look like
blouses and the boots
dont fit my foot ..
i think to myself
i could write a masterpiece
but people who suck cock
for porn thrills will
always get more attention...
pelosi and clooney join
the chorus line...
no way a grown man
elected president would
ever tell a lie...
cherry tree lip readers
whats the frequency kenneth...
in fact the church is
weighing on making
him a living martyr saint
along with jill...
the first lady bill
of three in one nights
all in, is everybody in?
i guess being in positions
of power, they feel
history can be pre-edited...
if this farce continues,
they might as well call off
democracy alike ukraine and
create another dictatorship...
as long as we can all pick
on a hard working actor that
happened to aim for the 
camera with a faulty prop!
ps,
viewed the exorcism and
there's more gladiator 
in it than ridley 
imagined, omfg.
spoiler; demon daddy
tells his daughter 
'she caint suck your
pussy like me...'yeah
like a drug i tell you.
thanks Russell this makes
up for the italian thing,
Crowe also thanks Hugh, but it
is a sit and scroll Grant world
now without a single movie
theater palace in sight.
	
eleven July 2024


bizarre dream. soft fur, dark creature 

with pleading blue eyes settles upon

right side nearly in an embrace...

i am laying down in the scene -

there is no reaction within my

emotion...a minute later a larger

creature clobbers the thing over

the head with some sort of

stick...i look at it partly confused

partly feeling sorry for the thing

still holding on to me...there's a

a crazed look in the larger animal,

if indeed mammal...i move to

awake obviously wondering

what it might have been about -

somewhere after midnight

i notice the internet is drifting

off - signal is alright, phone line

is good, but no connection -

i go through the on and off motions -

i phone the company but their

schedule starts at seven...

i actually connect the cable tv

and that is going through without

weirdness...the bulls in Pamplona

are being recounted...men dressed

in white and red racing in the frenzy...

i turn it off, no longer used to 

viewing television, then i turn off

the router too otherwise i will

waste time checking and reviewing

to see if the wifi is back. 

call at seven to hear them say

call at eight, call at eight for a long

wait to hear them say it will be fixed

during the day...

it happens at eleven soon after

delivery arrives, sister's maid also

bringing a pair of levis and

three vapes, they missed the thc

but i'm more upset over the shelley

duvall passing...i react with art

in the list and add Nashville to it -

13 july 2024

the earliest minutes of saturday -

awake midnight with mind swirling,

say goodnight gracie, bowers and

buffalo - dream intrusion man

asking if i am perez...stairs

key taped next to door - someone

like mason saying not to worry

about money - the dream
	
scenes going ninety

miles an hour...lotta could

see her stockholm street

from the skies - i created

a page for 2sg...

inkrealm.info/twoskinnygirls

luiza is going all out pink -

i suppose in slippery guesses

that putting such a spotlight

on emilee placed an extra 

dimension of pressure, given 

that it then became not only my

truth but a work in biographical

fiction or as the readers would

have it not to mention - as in 

an earthquake, the replica effect -

i surmise that i need more patience

than i previously expected -

unexpectedly i brought mother

out of memory's confusion by 

simply mentioning beetlejuice

and for a few minutes life

felt as it should...

i know some folks don't believe

in unicorns, but behold

the proof, winona ryder's

holy magic!

john lennon instant karma...

shooting in tompkins square

park - i pose the question 

to myself, baked alaska...

yes, to give the wip

a separate place...

feeling 'law' hounds sniff

even my "box" met delay

left three weeks ago

no, leaving tuesday

something about oil?

my christmas in july

might now be ruined...

watched latency -

impressed even if

not exactly lynch

which i had started

to expect part way thru...

a room of one's own,

"Literature is open to everybody. 
I refuse to allow you, 
	Beadle though you are,
	to turn me off the grass. 
Lock up your libraries if you like;
	but there is no gate,
	no lock, no bolt
	that you can set upon 
	the freedom of my mind..."
noon...

i view'd the inheritance
until peyton list got killed...

still wanting cinema i
went into wildcat yet left it
for later as it was too good
to see in the morning hours,
saving it for a goodly night...

moved the alaska writings
to  wordstar.nexus/bakedalaska
now just like that although
i have yet to decide over
the images to include or
maybe invent...

15 july 2024

i suppose, my point, although vague
at the act of writing for perhaps
trying to pour in too much, was
that now (nearing a third
election victory) donald trump
faces a pretty tough road
in terms of those nearest
to him...in essence, the 
attempted hit might give other
maniacs the idea that if they
can't get to him well there
always his children...a family
of targets...how does anyone
possibly deal with such a
situation. i doubt he will
pull out of the race but
nobody can blame him if he
does. wouldn't you? you know
it was the first time i 
encountered that johnson
quote, how ironic as history
finds the kennedy deaths
continued.  

yesterday, i continued
the alaska project, feeling
a need to fill up the word
count to actually call it
a novella...feeling that
a sort of mystery subplot
story could serve it well
as a sort of footnote
after the "ending"...
once upon a time, i heard
manson and he is the only
person i ever heard mention
it, speaking about abraxas
(sometimes abrasax) and it
seemed so obvious that I 
said to myself, how could 
I have missed that, I mean
there might not be another
word so near to alaska, 
abraxas - alaska's spirit
moved me to make it a 
scholar cat named hedvig
with a cameo by gogol -
two sofias and myself
in time travel reincarnation
put placing myself as a 
student of the occult
in a relationship with
one of the sofias while
intent on writing a book
about what was then known
as russian america...
i worked on it with gemma
but most of the time went 
into me telling her about
nova express and the western
lands...
the day was down to very late
afternoon and i was nearly
about to disregard the doherty
news when lucy made it a point
and thus led me to see the 
error as indeed the cinema
list required attention -
but i had two good reasons
one i felt no connection
to shannen and two i felt
it too weird a news item
on the heels of the shot 
ear...
but i must admit it made
for an interesting transition
within the list - 

in my dream i felt the
start of intimacy, but
then when the face turned
to face me it wasn't 
anyone i knew and awoke
disturbed -

yet dreaming again, i 
guess leah...for there
was a puppy dog even if
on reflection i ponder
if perhaps bijoux...
but either way all blurry
as if a myopic removed
glasses - i wake up with
that frenzy...far away
from myself, for a second
i can't remember lotta's
name, as if i'm trying
to quiz myself, shania
twain concert memory,
i see the girl on seventy
third street with her
four foot poodle and 
imagine her naked next
to me, then worry that
i will pass out and the
hound will start humping
me kids in the hall style -
alexandra blinks in thought
tel aviv not baltimore -
in the following seconds, as
all that took seconds not 
even minutes - i decide to 
escape the mosaic breeze
coming from bed...i greet
skirt, think of emilee, 
the third reich, and try
to gather myself into 
a calm state before taking
a pee. ps, a few months
ago i suggested to a 
family friend who constantly
struggled with health and
finances to fake his own
death in order to collect
insurance...i was informed
of his passing but find
myself wondering if perhaps
he actually took my talk
into a walk. whatever, i'm
happy not to have to fear
the phone ringing with
his voice elaborating on
the sufferings and need
ever so content in that
brand of christian faith
which obviously led karl
to go darn it is the opiate
of the masses - black strap
molasses and the wheat germ
bread - other marx sings...
	"Hello, I must be going
I cannot stay, I came to say,
"I must be going"
I'm glad I came 
but just the same I must be going, 
la-la!"
(not richard noel)

16 july 2024

the day was, yesterday, flying by.
someone in a hurry to make noise...
i'm thinking upstairs but sound
travels too - so maybe downstairs-
it's been happening for a few
days but dang there were about
four or five hours of clangs
sprining as if a desperate
attempt at your guess is as
good as mine...hurricane 
warning? cyclone alert?
tropical storm torrential
rain about too crash down
on the island? i look out
onto the avenue, no cars
in the garage so it must be
a maid or a makeshift
man doing a diy thing, no
clouds threatening, not even
rain...so perhaps a very
loud ghost...connie lee
warrant gullixson!
i give up, i go to sleep,
but the resonance of no
reason resounds in mind,
minds like to make sense -
for a minute my right hand
feels as if i had been
hammering away with a throbbing
or maybe the thought of lotta
knit me suddenly -
emilee fit me seduction yet
in the confusion i felt
it could not be her, not
within logic...worse
then family talk memory
as if insanity itself
has a point to make -
imaginary incest is all right?
maybe the neighbor is trying
to cover up fucking a dog -
i slide into
sleep frustrated, i find
no slack or solace in dreams -
up in the middle of the night
wherein it's already breakfast
time in europe and even gemma
is trying to speak to me...
so a billionaire stands next
to a beard, a pence for your thoughts?
and without hesitation tells the crowd
i took the deal, they dropped the charges
so new as for inky's concern for my 
family well i'm rich and thus can
afford to risk losing a couple of them
if that is what it takes to be by den
white house hotel dense with flag
invisble phantom empire gain again
but he didn't hear maga busy making
manga overlay idea in a try to 
raise the new domain's counter...
well into the demons or the devils
or as it is trying to be settled
in terms of title  the possessed, inky wonders
what dostoevsky is going for in
this novel.
