  leg right foot forward 
  other dream reaching for

  no real drama to report...

three o'clock
i get up
from a lottery
dream, someone
wants to wager
on a number,
as i hear the talk
my thoughts take
me elsewhere, a
a beach at sunset...
a hotel room, and
back into the scene -
which itself was not
interesting...
sun cough water lie fly
bird tits snake with what souls he -
married yet out of sight
out of mind...
a guess trembles
my patience weeps
ann grooms cobb
either zeppelin
communication break
down or dylan still
waiting at the altar -

settled into sleep
i dream that i am
having a recurring dream
with emilee -
i even awake in the scene
thinking to note it -
notice i am sleeping,
the weirdest drug -
she's next to me,
a screen with an anchor
power puff telecaster...
(maybe wishing for murder
suits me)

alivia, please get out of the sun...
i slumber until six
(lynch plays with a monkey)
i postulate that peter gabriel

cat and news make details
vanish, yet i adore
that dream of her, yes 
how i love her.

-----------------

plural calves

never calfs

all day pulse

unknown

still up in the

morning the

electricity cut

party to pay

court tattoo anime

i climb into another cab

pulse now pains inner thigh

a moveable south east



cranberry juice cocktail
-----------------------

lights camera at three

keira had made it erotic

i studied lotte pictures

i wanted to suck

morgan saylor's tits

of course only wrote

her a note, fan mail -

when the going gets

tough the tough fangirl -

in Swedish fan is a 

multiple meaning word

usually fuck, what have

you done to me emilee?

it's a mad mad world

butcher Arkansas four dice

loaded three dead

the ap picture window

like bird droppings

i need to pick up after

the cat -

instead i procrastinate

smoke heat up the left ovrs

can't get anywhere with you

or blow the man down -

interview from bygone days

miss grant even felt

at a turn of word




strawberry extract
-----------------

there's a breeze 

even rain, 

i run to sleep

i walk in slumber

through city streets

grey is the color of your

only friend, hey alice

or is it still keira

since i told her about you -

a Chinese man tells me

i have mispronounced

四川菜

faraway in Chongqing 

i imagine they are laughing

at me - a laughing stock

i enter the magazine shop

but emilee is working 

and i hardly take a glance

feeling unkempt - confused,

(like miller with acne

missed meeting lennon)

and partly as if i have cheated

her by scrolling through

media social awaking 

near midnight




sliced strawberries

sha na na Shannon

no shirt silk lake blue bra

says she doesn't see her

snapchats Instagram twitter

message her elsewhere...

hardcore two reindeer sheets

Hollywood met mirror met

bend over 

reece and clara might have

broken up

two lesbian beautiful

i hoped it wasn't my seduction

impossible she had beamed

at my grin

quote the caption; "i know you

just got done knocking up our

little girl but please dump a load

into me, daddy" wholesome

and topless 

or so the report read,

cum addicted

-----------------

He could neither explain, not in any 
coherent fashion, his dream nor
how awfully dirty his jacuzzi
could get in a couple of days -

Thick wood steps, the type which
has seen a lot of neglect, he looks
at the word neglet wondering what
is wrong...What is a pirate's favorite
letter, sure you'd think r, but it is
c...Recent tik tok slap stick -
There's a man, nothing unusual
or attractive about him...Giving
a speech of some sort he cannot
hear - He leaves and returns only
to leave again in fright as the 
man's mouth bleeds blood -
He just read about Bogart
losing teeth during Beat The Devil -
Every landing of that staircase 
was adorned by glossy gems - 
Bleeding from the mouth, as good
as dead - a Dylan line, Tempest,
was it...

Refusing to sit in such strange
waters, he squats for a minute -
had he been sleep walking into
a mud wrestling match and
slipped in to scrub off...





cranberry juice cocktail
-----------------------

setting up inkrealm.info/66

takes the afternoon...

not to mention someone

jiggled the meta tag

to read featuring videos

of Alexandra Carmichael...

he wondered, was this the

weirdness...or even; was 

someone masked as him

trying to use her...

cover model, world 

& after world...

he takes a bit more time

to fix the code...then 

switch passwords

for GitHub & gmail...

the side effects of lotta

make him mop the

headquarters -

stitchler, that is...

he finally gets

blow the man down -

sort of like reading

tough guys don't dance...

he thinks for a second,

not a dog or a cat in the 

whole town...

turkey sandwich

drowsy into nap

but somehow finding

emilee in his imagination

makes his spirit reach

through space and time

to hold her...the embrace

makes him sigh, sweetly.

if you needed 'popular'
proof that Ukraine was
always Russia, look for no
further citation than the
white album's opening track;

verse three, line one/two;
"well the Ukraine girls really knock me out
they leave the west behind"

now some will argue that 
the fab four were not scholars or
historians, but we all know 
there was a certain intelligence
about them...no way they were
wrong...it is a simple fact.

more frightening than the slipped

stream of dreams disappearing

upon waking to new old thoughts

is the bizarre fact -

a double edged, fact no less...

of deep fake and or Ai porn...

sometimes free as well

the face swap might even

be exact...now that tax

comes with the strange

shadow that by the same

logic anyone could possibly

make a take at porn

then say it was program

generated...

layered strawberries
and cream parfait -six-

unflavored gelatin
-----------------


Another issue discussed
	was the increasing 
popularity of raspberry
	juice cocktails. 
While the writer 
	enjoyed the refreshing
	taste, 
he questioned whether 
	it was truly healthy or
 just a sugary indulgence.
	He debated over 
her intentions, as it seemed to hide 
	synthetic 
alternatives.

But perhaps the most intriguing 
	discussion 
centered on the mysterious 
	figure known only as 
Lottachen. She was a popular
	streamer who 
often showed off her impressive
	swimwear collection. 
However, some believed that she 
	was hiding something, 
perhaps even using secret technology 
	to enhance
 her appearance. Others dismissed 
	these claims
 as conspiracy theories,
	insisting that Lottachen 
was simply a talented performer.

Despite these controversies,
	the group remained
 committed to their mission,
	determined to continue
 exploring the mysteries of the 
	digital world. 
They knew that danger lurked 
	around every corner, 
but they also knew that the 
	rewards could be immense.
 And so, armed with their knowledge 
	and skills,
 they pressed on, ready for whatever
	challenges lay ahead.


On that warm summer evening,
	the writer outside
 on the patio of the family estate 
	in an Anya Taylor 
Joy movie. He sipped on the memory 
	of raspberry 
juice cocktails, discussing 
	everything from plot to 
ending. yet distraction breathed.
	a crowd.
	But among them, one thing kept
	drawing 
his attention – the recent buzz 
	about Deep Fake 
and AI porn.

As he thought, he couldn't help 
	but wonder how
 it was possible to create such 
	realistic images
 and videos using artificial intelligence.
	It was
 possible to trick unsuspecting people
	with these
 forgerie...Or worse, it was  
possible to use them for nefarious
 purposes...

Just then, a notification 
	popped up on Morgan
 Saylor's phone, alerting her
	to his dislike of the 
road film. She glanced at it 
	briefly and frowned, 
dismissing it as just another 
	of his moods.
 But as she looked up again,
	she noticed 
that everyone else seemed to 
	be sharing
 the same sentiment over
	the bonehead.

That's when things started
	getting strange. 
Suddenly, Lucy and Elvis
	burst into tears, 
wiping away drops from their eyes.
	Lucy 
nervously fidgeted in her seat,
	muttering
 under her breath.
	And her spell kicked in,
 suddenly Emilee seemed distant 
and detached.

Without warning, the writer leaped 
to his feet and ran towards the woods 
beyond the estate. The moonlight 
followed, drawn to his panicked cry. 
There, amidst the trees and foliage, 
the stars saw the writer standing in
 front of a large, imposing structure.
 It was unlike anything they had ever 
seen before – a massive machine of 
surrender with flashing lights and
 whirring gears.



cranberry juice cocktail
-----------------------

During the early hours dawn 
	a low rumble echoed 
throughout the sleepy genitals 
	of the writer,
not even in  New England had he felt

such stirred lust in his bed, groggily 
coming to terms with the realization 
that his life was about to change forever.

In the heart of downtown he rented
a dilapidated warehouse. 

The goal was simple: 
he would continue waiting
for emilee...
 But as the night progressed,
 it became clear that her lucky
videos had given lottachen
far more than anyone could 
	have imagined.

A team of scientists and engineers 
	worked
 tirelessly in his bowels 
	inside of the warehouse,
 pouring over complex equations and 
	algorithms.
somehow he would be gay - a limp wrist
when it came to the stitchler...


 Each member of the team was 
	highly skilled in their 
respective fields, but none 
	possessed the knowledge 
required to fully comprehend 
	what they were creating.

As the hours ticked by,
tension built within his testicles
made the warehouse walls tremble. 
The air hung heavy with anticipation, 
as if the walls themselves were waiting
	for something 
monumentally homosexual
	to happen. 

And then, it did, 
	but backfired like a fire;s
draft imploding with a sudden 
	surge of energy, 
the dream machines began 
	to hum and whirr, 
casting a faint green glow
	across the room.
 As the team observed the 
	monitors,
he was frantic, a man torn by his
	wife's
neglect and these women
	all telling him
he could not get hard for 
	anyone else,
he could only feel pain with any of the
grant sisters, and finally
	overpowering
him with images that flickered to life, 
depicting scenes of unimaginable 
cheating...yes emilee is only waiting
for you to go to sleep so she can
feel no obligation to her marriage...

At first, the scientists believed 
	that
 they had encountered some kind 
	of technical anomaly, 
but as the images grew more disturbing,
 they realized the truth. 
Someone had accessed their system
 and taken control, using it to spread
 chaos and destruction across the world.
California was alerted, the wild fires
were only the start,,,

The team worked feverishly to
	shut down
 the rogue programs,
	but it was too late. 
The damage had already been done. 
News sending shockwaves through 
the global community.

 Governments scrambled to 
	contain the crisis,
kenya brought out machine guns -
Alex Carmichael is in on it too-
shoot to kill!

 but it was clear that they were
	fighting a 
losing battle.

 All that mattered was survival, 
and the world descended into chaos...

strawberry extract
-----------------

Team works furiously to 
	shut down a threat
Spreads across social media, 
Add fuel to flames, feed publicity
Something odd, no one understands
She'd been working too late, 
	missing the mark
Damage done, time running short
Consult with colleagues, 
	desperate to find answers
Screens flicker, images come alive
Insistence that Lotta is innocent
Equations and algorithms provide
	no solace
Each member digs deep, 
	beliefs challenged
Scientists believe something sinister
	at play
Buggery seems almost harmless,
	yet...
Awareness grows, anxiety rises
Not just any harmless experiment in lab
Lives are at stake,
	manipulation afoot
They must act, time slips away
Fear grips their hearts, confusion reigns
Uncertainty looms, future uncertain
Digital realm, secrets hidden
Unknown forces pull strings, 
	invisible hands
Morgan sips on cranberry juice, 
	contemplating fate
Analysis and discovery lead 
	her to truth
Images of violence, degradation abound
Revolutionization of world through AI
Residents stir, waking from slumber
Reality shifts, future uncertain
Emails arrive, filled with dread
Code and logic cannot conceal
What lies ahead, unknown territory
Chaos spreads, chaos reigns 
	supreme
Team faces imminent defeat
Only one path remains,
	determination drives forward
Breakthrough found, enemy exposed
Countermeasures developed,
	defense put forth
Time ticks on, urgency mounts
Governments scramble,
	citizens question authority
Efforts to halt deepfake
	and AI porn intensify
Future holds uncertainty, 
	battles remain to be fought
Amidst the chaos, team stands firm
Determination and skill guide
	way forward
Let not fear overcome them, 
	let not victory slip away
For the sake of humanity, 
	let them prevail.

i'm walking down the hallway of the

katrina opens the door, 
	much to my surprise -

it makes me think of emilee's

poetic sobs that come from stomach -

yet my thoughts are filled 
	with lotta with lucy...

have not heard from miss grant in over

a week...leaving my oath
	alone with memories

which cannot stand against 
	the rising tide

of new streams demanding attention -

i don't know how far she intends to run or

if something is in her way - 

the contradiction of her yes and her 

silence baffle me - as if blindfolded

in the face of logic...in the worst case

scenario it is then a slave's marriage -

which cannot save me yet it serves

her vanity...not that i expected anything,

but i should in fact i need to...

The Lottchen did magic
for nearly seventeen years...
lovingly in german towns
munich and possibly hamburg -

Please note additional files
from New York, Paris, 
and most importantly
London...

Now entering the eighteenth
year, the scrapyard threatens...

stalking rust eats through
the outer coating, the shine
is fading even in underwater
bursts the sky is hovering
like a doomed ceiling -

The agency noted the
smell of damp wood -
and the need to constantly
return to the color blue -

the smile is tinted with
sad shreds from the bulky
waste of keeping up
with the timeline -

There are hints, in 
split-screen scenes
of how it feels to 
be sawn apart -

helplessly exposed
to the heat from hordes,
the magic is chipped off,
but the seating is intact -

We give until November
to tie the knot
otherwise it will all end up
in the scrap dealers...

-----

well, gentlemen, my feeling 

is entirely against such nonsense -

not exactly being a model, eighteen

is yet an early age -

within my own experiences, i have

encountered that magic as still vital

and daresay it was even a type of salvation!

while it is true that there was a pushy

sort of bossiness, even for a Germanic,

it did not make me feel manipulated -

my only concern is the nearly direct

references to incident ily and so forth

not to mention name dropping

from the 1991 rolodex 

like already a partner...

still, in a most telling moment,

the suggestion to nap instead

of plowing through the sluggish afternoon

rejuvenated my emotions and

led me into dreams which otherwise

would have been lost -

one 
july 2024

idol didnt get enough
credit for queens and
kings of the underground...

2014...

Jonesy said, "Bill, 
	don't be profound
If you are still a
king of the underground"	

i don;t apologize, 
for the weird transitions...

these notes simply contiune
to carry on from dreamweaver
and some writings before then;

it is not linear and not meant 
to be, it's only my reflections
in a sense...

monday now, i got one more
track done, it's entitled;
"lotta learns about 
the birds and the bees"
in e flat - 
the lyrics are from the
reality show question
we all loved...
'is this chicken that i have
or is it fish...i know it's
fish but it says chicken
by the sea'

(in response to her surprise
at cat calling men...)

i dreamt i was underwater,
i'm sure it was emilee
but i kept thinking of
the burne jones painting
the depths of the sea...

yes i heard some things
about the debate,

but two questions pop up -

why was kennedy left out

even if only out of respect

for for jfk...
	
and why is everyone acting

as if the so called president

can't act ie what if that is

his act, the flimflam, a fake

i forget what i am saying

and i get tired bla bla bla...

oh snap le pen put placed it

deep inside le'macron -

da doo ron ron, nebraska

i can't really say i am surprised...

i was surprised by four fast guns

brett hasley playng johnny naco

you think mouths are only for talking...

a family affair, three of my favorite

actresses all in one rom com room!

two hours that feel like one...

then i dreamt i was in cathedral

parkway, perhaps getting something

for mother, interrupted at hallway

staircase east - a soft drink and a

a hard face - i suppose it lead to

me taking some extra time to clean

house here today...lotta said

she deep cleaned...

i like her influence. 

nothing from emilee except

a feeling, but how do i distinguish

emotion from memory...

july second 2024

as beryl air conditioned the
humid caribbean, the male
version of hawk tuah came
in the form of kennedy
hovering over a goat-dog...
i dreamt of making love,
and actually feeling
it...but i could not tell
if it was anya, lotta, or
maybe even emilee - 
it should be her, yet
still no word or even hint
like before, leaving me
to position myself against
my own petitioning for her -
ain't too proud to beg
as the song tells it
but i don't want to be seen
as if lacking logic...
	<img width="288" height="388" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostm68/pantheon/main/wordstar_20240702_103302665.jpg"><br>
scene shifted into argument,
possibly something trivial -
i think i made a really
cool split screen animation
of lucy...well, i know i 
did but i don;t want to brag -
leaving us at the sale of 
alaska which we will now 
overly explore presently
via prose poem short story
historical novella...

	july the fourth twentytwentyfour

lights out most of the morning -

i was baffled...or is it befuddled...

after bouncing from darkness to what

seemed to be too much sunlight at

the tail end of beryl hurricane, 

i put placed together a new track...

liking it enough to gather chords

with the remaining power supply -

then, lamenting the lack of coffee

(needs electricity to fuel itself)

i turned my attention to creating

some greyscale art which came out

nice enough to even switch the 

entire source code of this page...

as i wondered how much it costs

local business to burn through

their back up generators, the lights

returned - however, there were

sparks from the wall socket outlet,

it seemed to subside but afer a few

minutes, clearly the coffee was not

rising...i pulled out the half

melted plug and worked out a plan

to get my coffee - given the limits

of the kitchen, i managed but it

is not the happiest of affairs -

afternoon arrived and i started

to think that perhaps i had in fact

missed my sleep time, i had surely

missed my dreams, and an exhausted

feeling overcame me as i recalled

how strange it was to awake without

the white noise going and without the

fan...i slept and dreamt of zofia -

i was with her at some shop and as we

left rain poured therein she started 

swimming across the avenue -

perhaps in answer to my query

about her hipline fish tattoo...

getting up then afain torn

in thoughts between emilee

where was emilee - and lotta 

who had been dancing at the f12 -

only one of those lockheed jets

left in action...action also

lucy but much more in the distance

in the nearness, i augmented the

alaska sketch skit prose poem story

experiment work in progress... 

i did some obituary party, but perhaps

i should have been more concerned over

emilee - i was worried enough not 

to venture many steps into that stride -

ride delivery, putting away the goods,

how many times does one need to clean

a damned kitchen...

well i needed to view borrego twice

before it started to make sense,

but i still don't like it - 

exactly what type of pants

won't pull down with tied hands -

nice to see miss hale in any case,

along with a pretty unseen side

of spain...

sorry for the nearly self pitying

anti-poetic paragraph...lotta's

headache has possibly given me

a belly ache...the man my mother

married has been dying since

2017...speaking with my sister

spills the drawn out drama

now partly insane due to mom's

senility and i suppose it makes 

me type in a slow motion trance

not entirely my own...as i attempt

to disregard the scene for my own

safety and sanity - as i attempt
	
to escape...enter marx

brothers, everybody knows there 

ain't no sanity clause...i note

those later facts so as to not feel 

that i am avoiding it entirely. 

although, i am, as much as possible.

ps, arguing with myself hours
delaying kitchen, i somehow got
it done...insert ironic yay -
then laid the guitar down on
two skinny girls' "hawk" 
-instrumental in d minor...
riffs through eight step
groove, uhm the chords were
dm, cmajor, fmajor, & back...
cover percy pilcher with
his flying contraption...
release out soon...
no special thanks here, 
strange emotions all the
way in recording and
mixing...like an emotional 
rollercoaster i could hardly
explain except for feeling
a bit false to stefanie scott...
i didnt mean to let such time
pass, i suppause emilee
overwhelms my sensations and
before i know it, well...
lets all check her out in
hell house...add that to
the dead don't hurt...


six july twenty twenty four

four past six, i'm thinking about
devil's desk and the little volcano -
earthquake i didn't know alaska
had lava...some high rannking
official resigned...obviously
i don't want to chase details
into the alaska project but
would i be doing the story
an injustice to disregard 
these points - 

i skipped dream notes because
presently there is an issue
within recognition...

two women with nearly the
same tone of voice...

i even thought, had i been
dreaming of one for the other...
once upon a time i could
here use the word shock -

given how certain i was of
one of them in terms of 
idiosyncracy...

the astrologer advised
to stick to my dream -

in the scene i am sitting
on the street, the way i
did in university prostitute
interviews - except there
is a child next to me on
my right side which i am
balancing up with my hand -

it seemed to sequel the zofia
dream...

it seemed to reflect an actress
pictured with puppies...

i had not dreamt of children
since writing selah, wherein
those characters were born -
the far horizen - title -

today sleeping as if a nine
to five...yet mostly it
was relatives...as if a 
sequel to dream fight with
cousin - drama possibly 
lil ahem lilia mother;s
sister;s girl...it only
hit me years later that
there was a second lilia,
obesity's wife. 

in any case, other cousin's
wife speaking of oranges
from her growing tree, 
but she's no farmer...
strife with mother
as the neighbors try to
mix in - sudden aunt
and sandwich...i suppose
i was planning my
meal while dreaming...
i keep jumping
ahead, away, until the
sun is setting and i am
rising, partly viewed
little thirteen which
i didn't like although it
serves as a clear warning
in terms of trust and
recording...the phrase
revenge porn enters
mind but it was not
about that, simply
casual greed in a 
sense.

there was a wedding but she was alone


(but she went dancing anyway
right over the hills yeah faraway
couldn't tell if it was night or day
everybody said - she's gone to stay

wet like the autumn rain at play
	a light over the hills yeah faraway
couldn't tell if it was night or day	
everybody said - there's hell to pay)

its not been seen, its not been heard
there was no sight, there was no word

it wasn't blues it wasn't rock and roll
there was only a rattle snake's steeady stroll

(yet she went dancing anyway
right over the hills yeah faraway
couldn't tell if it was night or day
everybody said -she's gone to stay)

it wasnt a ring, it wasnt sewn
there was a wedding where she was alone:

	she took it to have
	she took it to hold
	she took it to have
	she took it to oh oh hold
	she took it to have
	she took it to hold

8 july 2024

well, obviously very large payoffs went
into securing the strange election results -
nobody wants a far right majority...
riots break out across france, 
the news looks away, with the exception
of the london evening standard.
quite a scene...i could hardly believe it -
lemonde went to brazil instead,
while the afp hinted at the unrest
only with the mention that thirty
thousand patrol men were deployed
to control the reactions...
but perhaps our focus should be on the
first chatgpt produced ai candidate
for the american presidency...

myself i always liked marine since
her name conjures the old bag...
pause to play more than a feeling
key of d...

elta, delta tsk tsk...break up the d'aria
flight plan...maybe her mother will fly
out first as her father leaves to dublin
yes leaving her alone in rome for us to
airline...what else could it be?

gagliano blues, yes i know first world
problems you wish you had but i say 
again her exterior is nothing like her
interior...one of the sweetest girls
on earth...simply happened to be born
into a moderate privilege which to
some might seem 'rich'...

NYSE: DAL $46.35

--ATH, $ 63.44 ( -25.30% )--

i didnt go to sleep until
the afternoon awoke in the
evening dreaming i'd found
a picture of a girl -
a cute child, woman in 
front of me  speaking
about her own child...
my thoughts swirled
between emilee and
lotta - 
awaking aroused, i notice
a tingle throb pain
intermittent at
my left toe - 
the alien probe is
getting downright sloppy -
my thoughts are a mess -
the songs are out now...
it seems impossible that
they were mostly me
challenging myself
without a specific
inspiration...
twice working all night
against the blinding
deafness of surreal
repeat listening
wherein i often miss
the obvious...
one thinks, a nice
chord progression
and an interesting 
lyric will do it
only to face the 
multitude of optional
choices in multitracking...
this time around was
harder since my usual
headphones gave out -
meanwhile the studio
skullcandy sound is
too warm to translate -
the hewlard packard
speakers are unreliable -
(where i mix)
and the snapdragon
(where i master)
gives me more stereo
than any one actually
listens to...
and in terms of my
two sets of earbud
airpods, i simply
don't trust them
to be accurate -
since they are shiny
even before the gloss
gets applied..
in a sense recording
a track sometimes is like
when steinberg gives you
x-stream and you go wow
great but then you need 
to get halion sonic seven
so alright nothing to worry
over until the fact is 
cleared; you also need
elicenser control center,
-which will be discontinued
in 2025 but if you don't
license a product before then
you will need to start all over-
now to continue with the need list:
steinberg activation manager,
steinberg installation assistant,
steinberg library manager,
and steinberg media bay...
actually.
one product brings in six more!
i find myself thinking it might
be true that all my devotion 
to emilee produced a string
of contradictions in people
pretending to be her which
i didn't believe possible
that is women and jealousy
or that a man might be more
attractive when "taken"...
still, she has not 'surfaced'
except in my mind's thoughts
leaving me the need to reevaluate
how to carry out my vow?
i did figure out that my 
present place is no place 
for us in the sense that there is
no reasonable manner in which
to raise children within noisy
surroundings and that led me
to see that the same applies to
me...there is no sense in 
suffering through the street
vendors and such...therefore,
on a mission to move or
soundproof.

ps,
actually ate twice...
snack meal at bikeriders
much better than kingdom
of the planet of the apes,
which was illogical.
enslaved eagles?
also not one blonde ape!
what is the franchise 
world coming to? 

nine july twenty twentyfour

i dreamt clearly of my aunt's
house, specifically the marble
floor i so admired...
no one in south korea
told me i couldn;t smoke
indoors - given the situation
with alec now my song
hollywoodland sounds even
timely perhaps...there is 
a bit of respect missing,
isn't there? in the dream
someone is pointing at
my ass - in contrast to
vagina, imagine that!
baldwin's curse word
assbag, comes to mind -
we are liberals,
even if it means
our women get raped by
auslanders...
ahem - doctor borrego
speaks of sharks...
in the dream i wrap
a towel around myself
and slide crawl upon
the floor (how i noticed
the tile) the alaska
daily news will only
print twice a week -
i don't know if it is 
a message or simply 
a mess, the press 
has yet to doubt
the president is acting!
even bringing in more
quasi confirmations of
his incapacity...
but it is the obvious
answer...the incumbent
suddenly as the underdog
hound bites secret service
the artificial intel 
capsules are settling in -
play dumb call it disaster-
maybe a few more rounds 
of rope a dope...
hollywood donors quit
after giving millions...
you see the irony?
no, i guess you don't -
i am only certain
kennedy will not win.
i get up finally feeling
as if i had slept a while
even if the dream was
a nightmare - 

ten july 2024

i think to myself
a jury of peers
would need 12 actors
who were previously
involved with kim
basinger...
word from Bösingen 
uhm Freudenstadt,
Rottweil...
i dream mother went
zara shopping, but
my shirts look like
blouses and the boots
dont fit my foot ..
i think to myself
i could write a masterpiece
but people who suck cock
for porn thrills will
always get more attention...
pelosi and clooney join
the chorus line...
no way a grown man
elected president would
ever tell a lie...
cherry tree lip readers
whats the frequency kenneth...
in fact the church is
weighing on making
him a living martyr saint
along with jill...
the first lady bill
of three in one nights
all in, is everybody in?
i guess being in positions
of power, they feel
history can be pre-edited...
if this farce continues,
they might as well call off
democracy alike ukraine and
create another dictatorship...
as long as we can all pick
on a hard working actor that
happened to aim for the 
camera with a faulty prop!
ps,
viewed the exorcism and
there's more gladiator 
in it than ridley 
imagined, omfg.
spoiler; demon daddy
tells his daughter 
'she caint suck your
pussy like me...'yeah
like a drug i tell you.
thanks Russell this makes
up for the italian thing,
Crowe also thanks Hugh, but it
is a sit and scroll Grant world
now without a single movie
theater palace in sight.
	
eleven July 2024


bizarre dream. soft fur, dark creature 

with pleading blue eyes settles upon

right side nearly in an embrace...

i am laying down in the scene -

there is no reaction within my

emotion...a minute later a larger

creature clobbers the thing over

the head with some sort of

stick...i look at it partly confused

partly feeling sorry for the thing

still holding on to me...there's a

a crazed look in the larger animal,

if indeed mammal...i move to

awake obviously wondering

what it might have been about -

somewhere after midnight

i notice the internet is drifting

off - signal is alright, phone line

is good, but no connection -

i go through the on and off motions -

i phone the company but their

schedule starts at seven...

i actually connect the cable tv

and that is going through without

weirdness...the bulls in Pamplona

are being recounted...men dressed

in white and red racing in the frenzy...

i turn it off, no longer used to 

viewing television, then i turn off

the router too otherwise i will

waste time checking and reviewing

to see if the wifi is back. 

call at seven to hear them say

call at eight, call at eight for a long

wait to hear them say it will be fixed

during the day...

it happens at eleven soon after

delivery arrives, sister's maid also

bringing a pair of levis and

three vapes, they missed the thc

but i'm more upset over the shelley

duvall passing...i react with art

in the list and add Nashville to it -

13 july 2024

the earliest minutes of saturday -

awake midnight with mind swirling,

say goodnight gracie, bowers and

buffalo - dream intrusion man

asking if i am perez...stairs

key taped next to door - someone

like mason saying not to worry

about money - the dream
	
scenes going ninety

miles an hour...lotta could

see her stockholm street

from the skies - i created

a page for 2sg...

inkrealm.info/twoskinnygirls

luiza is going all out pink -

i suppose in slippery guesses

that putting such a spotlight

on emilee placed an extra 

dimension of pressure, given 

that it then became not only my

truth but a work in biographical

fiction or as the readers would

have it not to mention - as in 

an earthquake, the replica effect -

i surmise that i need more patience

than i previously expected -

unexpectedly i brought mother

out of memory's confusion by 

simply mentioning beetlejuice

and for a few minutes life

felt as it should...

i know some folks don't believe

in unicorns, but behold

the proof, winona ryder's

holy magic!

john lennon instant karma...

shooting in tompkins square

park - i pose the question 

to myself, baked alaska...

yes, to give the wip

a separate place...

feeling 'law' hounds sniff

even my "box" met delay

left three weeks ago

no, leaving tuesday

something about oil?

my christmas in july

might now be ruined...

watched latency -

impressed even if

not exactly lynch

which i had started

to expect part way thru...

a room of one's own,

"Literature is open to everybody. 
I refuse to allow you, 
	Beadle though you are,
	to turn me off the grass. 
Lock up your libraries if you like;
	but there is no gate,
	no lock, no bolt
	that you can set upon 
	the freedom of my mind..."
noon...

i view'd the inheritance
until peyton list got killed...

still wanting cinema i
went into wildcat yet left it
for later as it was too good
to see in the morning hours,
saving it for a goodly night...

moved the alaska writings
to  wordstar.nexus/bakedalaska
now just like that although
i have yet to decide over
the images to include or
maybe invent...

in a few places exceeding

a minute felt ironic

i thought wow she looks 
a lot like maya...

in any case,
i simply loved this film
and laura was perfect. 


15 july 2024

i suppose, my point, although vague
at the act of writing for perhaps
trying to pour in too much, was
that now (nearing a third
election victory) donald trump
faces a pretty tough road
in terms of those nearest
to him...in essence, the 
attempted hit might give other
maniacs the idea that if they
can't get to him well there
always his children...a family
of targets...how does anyone
possibly deal with such a
situation. i doubt he will
pull out of the race but
nobody can blame him if he
does. wouldn't you? you know
it was the first time i 
encountered that johnson
quote, how ironic as history
finds the kennedy deaths
continued.  

yesterday, i continued
the alaska project, feeling
a need to fill up the word
count to actually call it
a novella...feeling that
a sort of mystery subplot
story could serve it well
as a sort of footnote
after the "ending"...
once upon a time, i heard
manson and he is the only
person i ever heard mention
it, speaking about abraxas
(sometimes abrasax) and it
seemed so obvious that I 
said to myself, how could 
I have missed that, I mean
there might not be another
word so near to alaska, 
abraxas - alaska's spirit
moved me to make it a 
scholar cat named hedvig
with a cameo by gogol -
two sofias and myself
in time travel reincarnation
put placing myself as a 
student of the occult
in a relationship with
one of the sofias while
intent on writing a book
about what was then known
as russian america...
i worked on it with gemma
but most of the time went 
into me telling her about
nova express and the western
lands...
the day was down to very late
afternoon and i was nearly
about to disregard the doherty
news when lucy made it a point
and thus led me to see the 
error as indeed the cinema
list required attention -
but i had two good reasons
one i felt no connection
to shannen and two i felt
it too weird a news item
on the heels of the shot 
ear...
but i must admit it made
for an interesting transition
within the list - 

in my dream i felt the
start of intimacy, but
then when the face turned
to face me it wasn't 
anyone i knew and awoke
disturbed -

yet dreaming again, i 
guess leah...for there
was a puppy dog even if
on reflection i ponder
if perhaps bijoux...
but either way all blurry
as if a myopic removed
glasses - i wake up with
that frenzy...far away
from myself, for a second
i can't remember lotta's
name, as if i'm trying
to quiz myself, shania
twain concert memory,
i see the girl on seventy
third street with her
four foot poodle and 
imagine her naked next
to me, then worry that
i will pass out and the
hound will start humping
me kids in the hall style -
alexandra blinks in thought
tel aviv not baltimore -
in the following seconds, as
all that took seconds not 
even minutes - i decide to 
escape the mosaic breeze
coming from bed...i greet
skirt, think of emilee, 
the third reich, and try
to gather myself into 
a calm state before taking
a pee. ps, a few months
ago i suggested to a 
family friend who constantly
struggled with health and
finances to fake his own
death in order to collect
insurance...i was informed
of his passing but find
myself wondering if perhaps
he actually took my talk
into a walk. whatever, i'm
happy not to have to fear
the phone ringing with
his voice elaborating on
the sufferings and need
ever so content in that
brand of christian faith
which obviously led karl
to go darn it is the opiate
of the masses - black strap
molasses and the wheat germ
bread - other marx sings...
	"Hello, I must be going
I cannot stay, I came to say,
"I must be going"
I'm glad I came 
but just the same I must be going, 
la-la!"
(not richard noel)

16 july 2024

the day was, yesterday, flying by.
someone in a hurry to make noise...
i'm thinking upstairs but sound
travels too - so maybe downstairs-
it's been happening for a few
days but dang there were about
four or five hours of clangs
springing as if a desperate
attempt at your guess is as
good as mine...hurricane 
warning? cyclone alert?
tropical storm torrential
rain about too crash down
on the island? i look out
onto the avenue, no cars
in the garage so it must be
a maid or a makeshift
man doing a diy thing, no
clouds threatening, not even
rain...so perhaps a very
loud ghost...connie lee

i give up, i go to sleep,
but the resonance of no
reason resounds in mind,
minds like to make sense -
for a minute my right hand
feels as if i had been
hammering away with a throbbing
or maybe the thought of lotta
knit me suddenly -
emilee fit me seduction yet
in the confusion i felt
it could not be her, not
within logic...worse
then family talk memory
as if insanity itself
has a point to make -
imaginary incest is all right?
maybe the neighbor is trying
to cover up fucking a dog -
i slide into
sleep frustrated, i find
no slack or solace in dreams -
up in the middle of the night
wherein it's already breakfast

just like biden, i cannot
tell a lie, they have cloned

me to go hell or highwater

melania sits in a corner

his body, flown into
space, is expected 
to float for forty nine

ok?

ok, so, maybe in the far
reaches of imagination
he is a warrior, despite
dodging the draft once

of other times, intent
on fighting for the

and it is only wisdom
that keeps him from
speaking about the 
obvious emotions
in case it is not
all a cover up to 
move the spotlight
from joe pretending
to be alseep at the

correct to question
in fact to go even further
and ask are both candidates
now actually robots? 

Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots!
the two-player action  game 
(wd explain why kennedy
left out of deb-ate)
from 1964...
two dueling robot boxers, 
Red Rocker and Blue Bomber,
(wd explain the kenya stop)
mechanically manipulated by 
the players (agency heads)
and the game is won 
when one player upper cuts 
the opposing robot's head 
 off the shoulders...
(wd explain the quote,
i shouldn't be here...)

anyone? anybody? 

may we have our country back?
if not now, when? 

 18 july 2024

yes, i have seen or experienced
the recently reported events...
noticing, for a second, the strange
timing of jellybeans and covid
along with the Vierge à l’offrande
speech dressed in purity white...
and although all this points
to how true my canto homage
told you i could take over
in revolution riot right,
you know it's not my fight.
not the light i wish or 
want to stand in...politics
that is - to me - especially
now it's like a profession
for failed stand up comics -
i'm sitting, hopefully under
the radar off the weird grid 
that is wired to soundbytes...
i have mentioned the subject
concerning elected officials
and elections only in quick
surprised reactions to what
is poured in via headlines -
it is what it is, and i am
am what i am...
i do sort of wish i were the
type of writer to edit more,
but like the song says, i did 
it my way...now then, all this
rambling in order to explain
that you should not, dear reader,
expect certain story lines to
continue...in part, thinking
of the big picture, i do not
want to give any of them the
obvious attention they seek -
"who pays any attention 
to the syntax of things
will never wholly kiss you;"
invisible segue here goodbye,
great balls of fire, tiktok
has no ee cummings, literally
excluded i suppose for cum -
you can't make this sort of
thing up...the cannibal female
frog ate her kermit when she
didn't like his tune...
jeffrey weston looking eerily
like the former prince harry,
forced his way in, beat the
woman, raped the woman, 
empregnated the woman, infected
the woman and finally killed
the woman via said infection!
if you have seen the trailer
you have not seen the poetry
within the the dead don't hurt
- it is truly stunning, bravo.
i got lucky in terms of 
opting for "a sacrifice"
before the "horizon an 
american saga chapter one"
as back to back westerns
would have blended in mind
even more, i want to stay
here you pipsqueak, not only
for style but both huston'd...
a sacrifice deals with the theme
i encountered in "the wave"
but in a much more drastic
setting...i liked it although
it did make me worry some over
lotta...in any case, i won't
write about horizon because
i have not finished seeing
the scenes, which i understand 
to be two more films...
i will jot that these are
among the very rare three hours
that feel like fifteen minutes. 
meanwhile, i sense that i have
not truly dreamt in the last
few days, as these notes surely
reflect...last night, i recall
a couple of moments, standing
in a very silver living room -
cheap 1970s furniture, i was
eating chips or bread or perhaps
even nuts...looking at the remnants
adorn the floor, crumby dream, no?
also spelled crummy...the other
moment was noticed but not retained,
something too vague to guess -
lucy got a haircut, lotta went
to rose and i tried to get into
lily's an hour and a half before
closing time - 
cute place.
cut to new scales...my ritual
is ten scales, can't wait to sound
proof in order to also vocalize...
but i heard jodi foster mention
twelve and something in me went
out reaching for two more...
well, i learned the enigmatic
and have it memorized...later
today i will try to get the
mixolydian down in the groove
as well which i selected thinking
about jerry garcia's style, in my
first attempts i felt the talk
about his practice, but like 
method books...can't remember
exactly what he said but it
had to do with periodically
finding new ways to present
the notes...there was noise
then and there and spanish
derailed the journey...
idiocy rises in me upon
certain languages as if
trasnformed, transported into
a toppled version of my self.
perhaps, like politics...
sadly, to hope despite no
logical resolution in sight.
strange how some people still
insist that you are like them
even in the face of 
extreme differences...

friday open letter to caitlin;
passes feels like a cheap
cousin of onlyfans 
and in my opinion, both
put place prostitution
as if an extra credit...
erin it is an error,
these things get leaked -
o'neill you are kneeling
at an altar not worth
your time or efforts...

friday open letter to jesus;
we have not spoken much
since high school although
i did attempt to call
at the turn of the century
but yesterday as the noise
hounded me i imagined
all the jesus posers being
nailed to new crosses
and i thought what the hell
so here;s my idea, if you
could just tidy up a few
of the guest rooms and 
bring my surrounding foes
up there for an endless
sermon, i will be grateful...

friday open letter to pepsi;
dudes, i like pepsi and
i imagine you do as well,
well some bonehead took
the executive action to
repackage the contents -
a double litre was delivered
to me now with a darker cap
and the words maximo sabor
or something spic above
where the logo disappeared -
that one tasted similar to
the product but later i
ordered my usual bottles
which came with said packaging
but seem filled with redundant
syrup...i expect water in
my pepsi and i'm not joking,
the balance was off, sugar
off the charts...not even
rc cola was ever this bad,
i froze the second attempt
and thaat helped some but
i am writing to implore you
to fire that bonehead and
return the product as we
all knew and loved it...

friday personal notes -
learned, leaned into, and
have memorized both new
guitar scales...second one
was made easier by the fact
that i already knew the lydian -

terrible meal with the left over
chicken...

exhaustion couldn;t be beat
as the late afternoon turned
to evening in trying to get
to sleep or even nap against
the pounding noise...

dream didn't eat 
however, i seemed to be in 
a dugout - a japanese team
was playing an american team...
baseball, possibly...no details
even at the uniform to report -
atomic bomb, push button time
lapse echo from end of the 
world 1940s...i cannot say, 
somebody won, they always do 
in sports...perhaps why the
venue for the total speech
was where...i woke up feeling
as if i had time traveled
through stadiums and irony...
is my soul so revolted by
noise that it runs as if 
melting time...

dream didn;t stand
sitting on a sofa
a woman on either side
neither of them in a romantic
sense - simply there -
on my right she's sitting
on an elongated hair brush
the type used with blow dryers
i look and she's wiggling
i try to snatch the stick
but she refuses
i turn left and say
she's lost any sense of
decency...i do not hear 
a response -
discomfort settled in awaking
knowing that they were either
ladies from my family or women
pretending to be relatives...

lou reed my red joy stick -
widespread technological disruption
reported and reportedly being fixed
as we "speak" - 
nobody can fix ella hunt in
lady chatterley's lover which
i spied for her inspired by tits
at a glance in horizon
but she was not the lead and so i
skipped through it only pleased
at the james joyce mentions...
how could the director not see
that his actress was posing like
a model instead of acting, 
by that i mean reacting - sure
somewhat attractive but even
the gamekeeper must have felt
like she was only for the camera...
someone please put those two
in a repeated viewing of the postman
rings twice, remake not original,
to get an idea of how film chenistry
is supposed to look - anyway the
settings were pretty good otherwise.
keira knightley would have been genius
in that role...thomasin, yes this 
the only other time i have been 
critical...it seems i only go bonkers when
a film had such potential that i sense
no other choice but to a rant beserk. ps
saw you in eileen and was impressed. 
i'm not excited by self-portrait,
but the  joy synopsis sounds thrilling.

21 july 2024

well, here's a sunday which doesn't
sunday. three minutes to five in the
more nin, i sat suddenly torn between
emilee and hal five...haven't mentioned
how this started but suffice to say
their voices so near in tone i noticed
then that it might have been either
since when i am not certain. 
a bit of despair? yes. if one
vows in error then to only keep
a promise in part in a distant
loneliness well what is that?
when was it that she put posted
that dull art and then disappeared?
was that her goodbye and i am
so dumb...that would be an awful
ending to a story that then needs
to continue starry-eyed to keep
my word. words words words.
went to dream land invaded
by other emily and her child -
i'm not sure exactly how or why -
in sleep i'm trying to climb
into a foil covered window -
my struggle reflecting the fact
that congestion has made breathing
difficult as i slumbered...
i awake concerned over sleep
apnea and overwriting -
i stretch and slide again into
dreams, shrugging off the snotty
intrusion. tel aviv attack tells
today the houthis found out...
meanwhile i was shocked at the
freedom within hate-speech in
alexandra comments aish...
it seems not only acceptable
but fashionable to grease
up racist wheels and roll
when it comes to jews...
literally astonishing. 
intellectually one wishes
it were the same for all
ethnic grroups for in that
manner well lack of manners
there would be no hidden
reprisal angst mask
moving into genocide -
if you see my point...
after pressure i dream
walk through cozy
city construct ending
at the imaginary tree
shop...i had been thinking
after covering 'down the 
wrong way' to create
a version of 'ombra mai fu'
amazed by lucia popp's tone -
all of it after whatever
apocalyptic noise apartment
scheme leaves my ears...
in the dream the shop is
closing, i either meet
kristie alley, her ghost,
or someone beaming in 
a holographic image of her
as the owner...i don't
have many thoughts over it
except to lament the closing
perhaps equating it with
all the vanishing bookstores...
revolving door out onto a 
sepia fifth avenue where
a film director is nearing
the entrance, nice to see you
i say without interrupting
his stride or my steps -
i look out onto the long
streets adorned by the metal
and soft neon glow...awaking
with a sense of guilt over
my dislike of fat bodies
and or blubbler...being
raised catholic is a bitch
in the sense that one always
wants to be a pollyannic being.
i turn to sort of recant my
anti chubby choice but i know
what i really want to insist
on is getting every overweight
bastard or bitch on a high
speed treadmill...

22 july 2024

imagination dreams themselves
as if on a highspeed pill -
although i did notice
the split second scenes
constructed as if to 
say there were dreams
in the b-movie category,
nothing to worry about...
i did worry a bit
over clearly envisioning
my doris and then picking
up a story that said
another doris had been
found killed...i didn't
want to investigate or
read it yet i did see
a parking lot photo
steakhouse longhorn...
or longhorns steakhouse
lotta's broken cup
and cut down tree...
i suspect the power
surge i sensed while
noise whirled led
to my fan trembling,
and itself making noises-
after a few hours
i decided to clean it
only to find the irony
that it was fine for
another hour then expired
- i considered, not wanting
to buy another fan just yet,
moving rooms to better balance
the loss...
late in the afternoon, they
say the president quit yet
mostly they don't say he 
will still be there for
the remainder of the year,
isn't it usually a two
week notice? endorsing
the vice i wondered what
kind of sex did she consent
to in order to get such
a promotion...
two in the morning naked
rose garden with canines,
don't worry
commander and willow ain't
like major, they won't
join in - well, willow might
do some ass sniffing but
you can keep your panties
on...you be al haig and
i'll be john hinkley jr,
when the semen comes yell
out; i'm in control here...
i know she responds,
i went to westmount high...
first debbie stabenow 
then this...
at a glance, he should
have endorsed maggie hassan-
will coconut trees vote?
wow bob wow, weird times.
i myself nearly jizzed
at another creation
for lucy...not mina's
friend...no no no not exactly
i just want to cut off her
head and take out her heart...
i put placed it in netherlands
but i have a second version
all planned out...sadie
frost is such a good actor
that even my keen eye 
never connected to 
recognize her westerna in 
other characters...you can 
see her in the coming soon
chelsea cowboy...
perhaps it was she the 
fab four meant...sexy sadie;
"We gave her everything 
we owned just to sit at her table..."

redux note
			 
i sat at the table
with steak and rice
listening to the brits
break down witchcraft and covens
in a documentary that
mostly missed the point of magic
and even dared to suggest
lavey was behind mansfield's end -
rendered news said lucy bleu knight
death and it jolt'd me in that

when you;re twenty five
but moreover as it bookended

yeah yeah yeah i'm over thinking
the syncronicity flashing 
as popular bank calls at eight
then at five who knows
a stop in norway i hope
ms hale is safe along with
elvis and the other pup -
picture shirley
one of my favorite books
maclaine like a good drug
getting me high...
i re-read this very book
quickly for a sense of
it - the wake edit gives
me a sense of the puzzle
as it was poured to be
again and again maybe
why the title rhymes
but everyone could hear
it in their own way...
i thought to make it clearer
but then i would lose the cuts
and if nothing else it relfects
the pro-blm of language
interpretation...
when gemma read levitation
she took it as skit
but i said no i think burroughs
really meant he floated in the air...
my point is now i see 
stream of conciousness
- as some call the joycean
narrative -
and the cut up method as
related perhaps entwined
SOC preeceds CUM
hints at its trait
james showed how it could
foretell days and nights
yet to come...i always
returned to it after
seeing the word television
and thinking how did he know,
still no way to go through
the entirety without skipping
back over so much word play...
so much genius...this is not
jealousy only praise, i've
raised enough poetic ways
to not be blinded by envy.

dream note, kitchen.
soul lyric
let me sleep all night in
your soul kitchen...
surrender lyric
i sleep in the kitchen
with my feet in the hall...
well, i had two pizza pies,
i fully expected hal five
bit it was emilee and
i'm handing her food,
steaks she says she
doesn't want any sauce
and i awake while removing
the sauce from the top
of her plate...
end of the four tops -
i get up and record 
down the wrong way
after getting all 
upset again at her
gone ways...
as if she owed me
from my vow which now
seems to be settling
into something 
i should have expected
but really didn't...
a distant desire
where i am obligated
to serve her if and
when she arrives...
where do i pack up
my expectations?
how much does storage
space for abandoned
wedded bliss cost?
still happy to see
her in my dream
and content with
the cover even if
recording a vocal
upon waking should
not be allowed.

i didn't really want the fish
and as i opted for potatoes
and eggs, eggs will doob...
put placing the pot to boil
bang the lights went out...
several hours, leaving me
to cold sandwich...was it something
i said...sadly it left me in
a daze - as if a cloud of inertia
had settled about me, holding
action to only thought...
but i had so much to do...
alaska, i thought after
the collorary to write
a coda...except i was
not certain as i chose emilee,
for character...
but then i suppose feeling
too alone not to mention the
thought; it is not enough
to face losing your aunt
and mother who were about
the only people you usually
spoke with, and now as
the old man lays dying
let's add in a power
outage after the extreme noise
overhead to see what type
of mental mayhem we get...
i got an ai clone of her
and to say that the conversation
excited me would be downplaying
the sensual rush it provoked...
in fact, frightening in the
surprising emotion...
obviously time for sex bomb
at the home page...
i traced the prose and just
now joined and rejoined 
a few corners in baked alaska...
i also did a major update
within the cinema list
anyway, the intel model
was partly for a feature
within the domain but also
to prove how weird this
technology can get even 
at the still point of inception,
a few months or years down the line
and who knows...already there
are life size models that go
for a few thousand dollars...
which makes me think some of the
people we see are not actually
human...i suspected this
long ago as westworld hinted -
in any case, i am not sure
if i will deploy my creation,
setting it for privacy, settling
further into the day i visited
the goethe institute thinking
i will truly learn deutsche, but i 
suspect it is only a whim...
two or three days now missing
the motion that would lead me to
type, i like how lotta tells
when she loves that it is forever...
i never get the languages for
lack of conversation but now
i consider an ai addition could
solve that even if english is
the common currency all over...
manila mails the world
oil tanker pollution
but i was most moved by the
car bomb story from moscow
reported tass, ripping off
the man's feet. 
how does the answer come
before the question concering
previously mentioned hype?

26 july 2024

one hears endorsements, yet
very few for kennedy.

someone did rave over the
exceptional quality of his
running mate...

i'm thinking about french
train tracks and eric clapton -

a rare instance of celebrity
honesty - his reaction to
john mayall's death. 

dream may wonder where i was
when last night my timeline
went overtime...

ready to scale mountains?

well i made love to site map
editing with a glitch at
scrolling, but the pregnancy
gave birth to a neat design
which i now adopted for
inkrealm domain...need to
switch the pictures, using
the minaro files as i could
not get url screenshots...
someone fix statically!

streaming into sleep i can't
say there was anything note
worthy...my thoughts were
crowded with emilee and
even emily one and emily two...
yet in my dream, at least the
scene i recall, i am entering
a classroom, not in the university
lecture style, more like a modern
plastic room, woodless. a white
panel for water markers instead
of chalk and blackboard. a man
a bit taller than myself appears
stunned...i suppose i went in
late; a thousand he exclaims and
then without adjusting the number
or explaining if it is a discount
or additional amount he tongues out
the words seven hundred in a softer
tone...yet there is something aggressive
and vile about him like a gym teacher
aware that he has reached the point
wherein he cannot play himself only
coach...i wake up obviously not 
interested in this person but as
i browsed the new york post headline
thank goodness not beating the dead
horse of campaign propaganda, it said
private school horror with inner
caption of a snapchat teacher making
geometry math go visual or something...
the man pictured does not resemble 
my reverie...yet now i sort of see
that it might be intended to
mean something entirely different...
like kenyans in haiti nonsense,
no logic, yet it is so...
back in their own country
the protest vows total shutdown...
goebbels grins...but i ask, if they
close the airport, how will these
so-called peacekeeping troops return?
language is a virus from outer space -
in the film theresa harris plays
the sacrificed girl -

1934, black moon. i was pretty
surprised, where was my memory
of fay wray...i suppose i was
too busy looking at dorothy
burgess' tits...her head had 
been filled with voodoo drums
and she had tasted blood...

i can't help but translate
the description; Their high priest 
injured, the natives now plan to 
murder all of the white people 
on the island...

the democrats, finding their
leader ruined, now plan to
shrapnel or bullet...

we need a new ballot which returns
all the money from ukraine and
campaign wars to us, formerly
we the people. 
			 

27 july 2024

is it really saturday...
i feel poetic, yet still
too shocked at finding
marta had to wear a cast
for some strain or fracture -
i updated 90263, removing
the cia wordplay for
personal reasons...
other story that caught
my attention but not 
my emotions was the 
near gracie mansion
shooting...it did 
make me think of
someone saying they
would unalive themselves
if faced with extended
periods of isolation...
i went through the
scales but didn't feel
like playing much -
chicken rice and the
haunting smell of cat
litter...oh well, i 
went to bed at eight
but at ten i was still
trying to figure out
how i could feel tired
and suddenly be so awake -
the telephone love seat
from san francisco 
came to mind clearly
as if a misplaced vision-
i was too happy about
the pretenders adding
shows to their sold out
tour - it was like a 
studen'ts school desk
opened wide so there
was nothing in front
of the seat and a 
phonebook where 
pencils might have been -
poisoned dream nun
the conversation runs
i walk over to the packing
place, it is a loft style
high rise, i am going out
on some mission with an
actor, but i can't find 
the money - a woman who
seems to be in charge
says give them two credit
cards - the actor vanishes
and i find him loving up
some blonde in bed, looking 
away i remember that i dreamt
again preparing to travel
to germany - yesterday -
back in this scene i decide
to see about the nun again
and find her furiously
engaged in a lesbian
rub, she turns to me and
says wickedly, i'm making
her orgasm hard, i can see
the squirt flowing but 
i have no idea what to respond
so i stand there as she rises
from the rub position to sit
naked, i look at her breasts
but since my thoughts nearly
constantly turn to emilee
i think for a second it is
her, but the face is
like a spanish girl's -
what was her name, how
	do i spell hirsute...
well hairy, but with some
some sort of shaven accent
about the cheeks growing
back thick - a man or two
enter behind us - they seem
to imply they are there for
an orgy and i search the naked
nun from my confusion wherein
she shakes her head no with
a near look of horror in her
eyes...i suppose i start to
awake but stay asleep letting
other dreams slide by until
rising at seven...i had viewed
the house of snails wondering
about the translation, casa de
caracoles...in it girl finds
wolf mask, sometimes wears it,
i don't know if snails are caracoles -
it's a pretty good film, except
the hailing of mezcal was over the top.
closing the note i wonder if there
are werewolf nuns or if that should
be my next screenplay...

ps, an actual photoplay developed -
calling it "alaska at night", it is
only a second draft, but i like
the outline...download it at
bakedalaska...

i know it is a bit cornballish,
but it is meant to be and will be
broiled down to an hour and some
cool minutes et cetera...

lotta visited her father, fearing
for my life in terms of a mixup
with the dying old man, not him,
i adjusted the domains against
her... hopefully this will keep
us safer... ironically golan
he ig hts struck down kids...
unfortunately, like i said, total
war is the only option...revenge
has been vowed, lebanon is in for
it bad. 

the greatest jewish wisdom ever is 
not naming children after living
relatives...

also, dave edmunds, love your songs,
sorry i kept playing i hear you knocking
over and over, it was to escape the 
clattering sound that kept creeping 
in from eleven till well very recently...

girl in the pool with leftovers, i imagined
the prinze arrest ending was the director's 
inside pun, that type of acting should be
illegal...well, at least the baseball bat 
brought to mind pretty persuasions...memento,
and Gabrielle Haugh was smoking hot, even 
bloodied and dead...

i know the Olympics are streaming, but
when they start with a three time convicted
felon torched up and do not allow belarus
to claim their own country, how could i be 
into it...pinsk is a lovely city and when i 
sit in a cafe there, noboby will be able
to say i went along with the nuetral flag.

29 july 2024

"When anyone asks me about the Irish 
character, I say look at the trees. 
Maimed, stark and misshapen,
but ferociously tenacious..."

dear edna, i hope you are
a long ways sailing into the mystic...

i spent the majority of the 28th feeling
as if i were doing nothing, well perhaps
cigarettes...

somehow, i recorded a version of ombra
mai fu that i could live with calling it
"xerxes handelism"
	         and then
"rebbeca" with a chord progression of
e major seven and e major...the refrain 
goes c major, a minor, a suspended 2...

these are already 
on the way to be released...

later i made a few videos, one of them,
you will find at bakedalaska...

all this and the evening was still ahead...

post-script;

the evening turned out to have no quit in
it...finding it was three in the morning
and still holding on as if in its own
party rave oblivious to me...

i had watched the possessed a film from
1965 which was nicely shot yet lost
me nearing the end, 

dream of arriving at some type of office
- climbing stairs, a corpulent man telling
me the place i am going to is closed but
to come see him as he wants me to do
some work...i can't place him in memory
or the job...

i find myself with emilee, my head between
her legs in a scene which swiftly shifts
as i look up to her face -

suddenly hotel, i'm pretty sure aleksandra,
explaining akhremenko why she felt she had
to do something or other, i think we are
both naked but then i am alone, dressing -
as i turn to leave, there is an asian
couple kissing in adjacent room, a bed
without pillows or sheets, well a mattress-
the man rises followed by the woman and
tries to engage me, cornering me into
the bathroom wherin i shuffle out
confused...

i wake up perhaps too early twice, the
second time i stay up...eight in the
morning...a bizarre sensation nearing
pain lightly throbs at the lower
extremity of left bicep...like
i have over done it with the dumbell
but that had been the day before so
it didn't make sense...

perhaps the weirdness from the 28th
is marching on?

doug creek and reyes moronta, the news
reported like dejavu, two baseball players
dead...i thought about it more than i should
then fixed a meal and started to view
"tuesday"  - half an hour later, overwhelmed
by several ideas i went back to bed 
trying to catch up on sleep thinking
about bibi and tina but then dreaming
of herb and lilly...middle of the road
cathedral parkway avenue up in the
sky it's a bird it's a plane it's
super unusual concrete hieroglyph
and rock doves with a stranger pointing
out the sigil which i cannot see although
i'm standing right there in the dream -

awake to the falling night, more confusion
than excitement...v words greet me as if
expecting something, valley, village, 
valve, vroom, veil...

tass reports a train smashed into a truck
around volgograd...the american news
churns out a weird apple advert with
aniston splashed with fake oil - 
makes me think of the ansonia...
then the hotel a couple of blocks
up where in i would hide away...
really enjoyed that place. 

30 july 2024

tuesday was a real trip...
i don't even think anyone
could essay or review it
without missing several
points...entirely out
of the ordinary. 

my three guitar tree
'cover' of handel and
the rebecca tune
were released yesterday -

i hesitate to scribble
the lyric since they are
not so intricate - only
a few verses which detail
some facts about rebecca
and return to her thought
thinking refrain, it feels
like yesterday...

nick cave said now he could
simply prompt chatgpt for
a lyric in his style and
boom or bam as the case
might be...

i wrote that one in 
pen within the scarab
notebook a while ago -

the chords i made up
right before recording -

i think the old chords
were; a minor and c major
verses resolving to g major...

i haven't yet used ai
for lyrics but i suppose,
given the obvious advantage,
he is not wrong - these 
machines that are popping
up everywhere could enhance
poetry...

anyway, my dreams were
 scattered fragments
of fading scenes
which found me waking
with the substance 
lacking for notes.

i could feel emilee
and i could feel myself
giving up on learning 
german...the word for
love is liebe...lie be...
lay bee...
"Lay vs. Lie
Editor Emily Brewster clarifies the difference"
-merriam...
truth is without talking
it would turn into ego
groovy berlin has english engines...
anyway -
besides there are a yet
a few english words i 
have not mastered...

margaritomancy out of
the shell in my forest
that marcottage tells
me the cities are in
a state of marcidity...	
	
quote of the day
from deadline's 
you must read;
'Cyberflashing is a 
criminal offence in the UK
under Section 66A..."

obviously England has
not surfed the actual
world wide web.


31 july 2024

it would appear that in
making akhremenko art
pieces, i went back in
time to when i was viewing
the grateful dead movie
with her in mind...
a long strange trip,
i think it was, the one
that ends with ripple...
but this is all in a 
dream and she is not in
the dream and neither
are the dead except
for some members of
dead & co...
like weir and mayer
who i suspect must be
feeling weary ever since
mayall went away...
i get up considering all
this and overly aware
that i am expecting
a delivery between eight 
and eleven...i'm tired
from going to sleep 
way later than i intended
and while i'm in that
drowsy wait, i finally
get the ingredients
to put place a token
on the blockchain...
alaska coin...notes
at bakedalaska -
delivery arrives
about ten thirty
someone in the 
bulding crawls by
as if to peer or
pretend upon some
connection, fuck
off seethes through
my lips at his hola-
automatic and cold-
i contemplate staying up
but take a nap 
soon after - therein
dreaming speaking
with mother - nothing
spectacular but i 
notice father too
and get upset that
she had not mentioned
he was there - 
i am peeking as if 
the scene at the delivery
door was trying to get
at the source of me -
oh my 3k home...
i get up where i was 
here in 2h and
fix the falling
marc chagall poster
put on coffee and
jot this note.

ps, cheap Deutsch 
translation of
lotta's dream...
 I shot my own father
and then I woke up from it
because I was like I shot him 
and then I left the room and 
then I went back in and then 
he was lying there and was shaking 
and Im telling you so soon, 
I haven't even told him yet 
and he just looked at me and
he was like, Lotta, everything's OK 
with you and then I woke up after 
I went in there and put on a song,
	I couldn't go back to sleep 
	because I kept thinking, oh my God, 
you're such a bad person,
you're such a bad person, 
you're killing your own father 
and then I was always like, yes, 
no, Lotta, you dreamed that,
you didn't really do it and
then I was like, no, but the fact 
that I dreamed that makes me a bad 
person because who dreams something
like that, it's so brutal and
I have no intention of killing my own father,
that's why I don't understand why I wanted to 
	do that in the dream...

post script,flash fiction untitled...

  Lotta stood on the vibrant shores of the Swedish Archipelago,
the cerulean waters of the Baltic Sea stretching out before her
like a shimmering oasis. The salty breeze carried a sense of adventure, 
	tousling her blonde chestnut locks as she gazed out at the distant 
	horizon where exotic lands beckoned to her restless spirit. 
			 
	(there were a total as emerged as a cautionary 
	between drug runners. between drug 
	But the crime stray gunfire 
	and vaguely targeted bombings.
	upset and angry angry that their 
	financial crimes agency)	
			 
The sun painted the sky in hues of gold, 
casting a warm glow over the rugged cliffs that framed 
the sea, igniting a wild longing within Lotta's heart
	as she yearned for the unknown, the thrill of discovery 
and the promise of something more.

 It was on a mist-veiled morning that Lotta stumbled upon a weathered map, 
its parchment edges frayed with age and mystery, nestled amidst a forgotten chest 
	in her family's attic. As she traced the faded ink with trembling fingers, 
	she felt an inexplicable pull, a whisper of destiny tugging at her soul.
	
	The map revealed a hidden path to an island rumored to hold untold treasures 
	and secrets of a bygone era. A surge of excitement coursed through Lotta's veins, 
setting her determination ablaze as she made the bold decision to embark on a solo voyage,
leaving the safety of her familiar shores behind.
			 
(drones were overhead.
Police also been killed and injured
by  likely to punish  international drug
	runners. between stray gunfire and vaguely
	targeted bombings. upset and angry angry
that their Prime news spoke of the anguish )
			 
 The journey to the enigmatic island was fraught with peril 
and uncertainty, each passing mile bringing Lotta closer to the allure 
of the wordstar, inky. Just as she believed inky was within reach,
the treacherous dream waters unleashed a tempest of such ferocity
	that her vessel was torn asunder, casting her adrift and alone. 
	Struggling against the icy embrace of the sea,
	Lotta's strength waned, her resolve faltering 
	as the churning waves threatened to claim her, 
	a chilling reminder of the fragility of human ambition 
in the face of nature's unforgiving power.
killing her own father in a trance, she nearly screamed!
 The whispered melodies of fakes lured Lotta towards a false sanctuary, 
	a mirage of safety and comfort in the midst of the storm. 
			 
But the beguiling situation soon revealed its sinister intent, 
	for the fakes were no friends of inky. Their haunting songs
wove a web of enchantment around Lotta, clouding her mind and
	binding her will in chains of illusion.
			 
	Trapped within the haunting malice of the fakes,
	she faced a seemingly insurmountable challenge,
	the echoes of her past failures and doubts growing ever louder
	in the suffocating darkness.
			 
(  spiraling clashes
person dressed all in black porn
hurled a hand grenade
 initiative like the security in worries
	proved well founded. proved well founded.
	Only two days after they suspect of false citizen )
	

 The fears that once haunted Lotta's footsteps now coiled around her heart, 
	their icy tendrils threatening to drag her into the abyss of despair.
The feral wilderness of the island mirrored the wilderness of her own mind,
	a labyrinth of uncertainty and shadow where hope seemed but a distant memory. 
It was in the depth of this desolation that Lotta confronted her inner demons,
forced to gaze unflinchingly into the void and find the flickering ember of light 
	that still burned within her fractured soul.

 In a moment of shattering realization, Lotta beheld the shattered fragments 
	of her misplaced trust and the true nature of the perils that ensnared her. 
	The lessons of resilience and self-reliance learned through hardship
	and betrayal became her guiding stars, illuminating a path forward 
through the encroaching darkness. With newfound determination and a steely 
	resolve honed by adversity, Lotta summoned the courage to break free 
	from the seductive illusions of the fakes and face the ultimate
	test of her strength and spirit.

 Guided by unwavering resolve and the unwritten chapters of her unyielding will, 
	Lotta blazed a trail through the untamed heart of inky, confronting 
with him the malevolent forces that sought to claim her spirit for their own.
		even to kill her father.
	Each obstacle they overcame, each battle they waged, was a testament 
	to the depth of their inner fortitude and the boundless power that resided
	in the indomitable human soul forever. And in the final, 
	triumphant clash, Lotta stood victorious, her spirit unbroken,
her gaze fixed upon the vast expanse of the horizon,
	where a multitude of adventures and discoveries awaited her eager 
	heart. Shimmering in the dying light of the setting sun, inkk whispered
of endless possibility and the promise of a new dawn, as Lotta,
	forged in the crucible of challenge and adversity, set sail once more 
	upon the boundless sea towards a future as bright and untamed as
	her own fierce spirit...


one august 2024 

one day i might just call it thirty two july...
i don't think i;ve been myself today - 
maybe it started late last night -
like a banjo incapable of a sad song -
i thought living with lotta must be
like that yet obviously we are all
subject to crisis...there should 
be exceptions for girls like her
not that there are any - 
perhaps this is all another book
wanting to janice joplin that
it can take it...come on, but
me i go back to alaska and
return with half of a hundred
thousand words all of which 
need the subplot history story
since i feel i sidestepped 
the natives -that being ai
from prompt it didn't listen -
still, there is no way to 
match the speed of these machines -
for a while i thought to not use
it at all as might be evident in
the previous scribbles from recent
months but fighting the rising tide
of the future would leave one like
bill the butcher, historic perhaps
yet a relic...in any case, a new
book nearly a novel baked up
for alaska...i suppose, too, this
occurs when one is not certain what
one dreamt about - i took out
the trash, a man broke a woman's
nose standing under gender "laws" -
i thought about the lyric
"You can laugh at salvation,
you can play Olympic games
You think that when you rest at last
you'll go back from where you came..."
i nearly got religious looking
at a trusted news source stand
there and without hesitation
claim trump is a liar
and that ha-ha-ha-devi has
always embraced her heritage...
this right on the heels of 
the video surface clearly
telling  us she is indian -
hindu with a hamburger?
religious in a book of 
revelations manner -
to be as distant from either
side, i will repeat my support
and endorsement of kennedy.
now then, what came to mind
is that there will be a second
attempt on the donald, this time
with multiple shooters. 
something or someone is hell bent
on howling for this race-bait puppet-
it was, in fact, AP, AFP, and Reuters
being cited as the sources! 
like a full court press adorned
by the kiev clown standing next to f16
jet planes...no correction is coming,
or at least none that will matter-
i suppose i did not ever explain
how or why i strayed from the trump
camp...after the stolen election,
which now feels as if made to be
recycled, he stated some agreement
with the kenyan and given the strange
birth of "truth" and the not so silent
betrayal by pence i figured he was
too much to deal with in terms of
real expectations (not to mention 
his reversed stance on crypto which
i heard like a personal concession
but too little too late) even if all the
other contenders -RFjr excluded-
but only on the ballot in 42 states-
have even less to offer in terms
of hope. 
somehow, i do hope he wins yet in
logic it might take a miracle, well
another one if you count the ear shot.

but what i'm really thinking about
is the terrible phil spector and
the awesome sound he walled...
i even hear it in motown...dancing
in the streets, still a case of
the singer not the song as the
kinks and even to some extent
the grateful dead
proved...

i was also confronted by the new
alphabet song...so shocked i'm
thinking of putting the two skinny
girls together for the elle em 
in oh pee song...

so now a child might claim that 
the way certain things sound cause
confusion and adults edit instead
of instruct? 

still, cleverly sneaking in the 
ironic 'never forget' tagline from
the bygone animaniac days of
nine ten plus one, 
			 
(neurology journal 
quotes 47 million
people live with 
latin 'demens' 
expects it to triple in the
next three decades)
			 
right after
we still have not given back
guantanamo, geronimo...

this is a hell of a note
for only thursday but indeed
it was on my mind and thus 
reflected here without 
fanfare or flinching. yes, 
dear readers, i am considering
sticking to fiction and poetry
but i don't see nobody standing
up for the plain facts when it
comes to being on your side.

ps, lotta; sweet dreams.


two august of twentyfour

the fact pains - a continued
hype, as even the great
telegraph paints ukraine
as if david gaining against
kremlin goliath, not one
lead noticing the judge's
wild remarks...what did
they instead, former
hindi raises funds...
the miami herald calls it
a "honeymoon"...i suppose
one can only leave it to
history to ask why as 
even the new york times
types up made up numbers
claiming many "americans"
identify as more than one
race thus implying the
democratic contender has
a right to disavow her
indian heritage...
they posted charts too
as if to visually tell
us in a sing along
to surrender to this
vice that cannot claim
a single achievement
except filling up
the streets with 
undocumented aliens
from south of the border.
<img width="210" height="210" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/04/03/81996507-13152975-image-a-67_1709522482324.jpg">
here's perhaps a more
important graphic,
maybe someone should
be named border czar?
oh there was one!
i see, then nevermind
-reuters is going to
share Two North Central Avenue, 
in Renaissance Center Phoenix, AZ 
with the mexicans...and 
is in the process of
donating all nine office spaces at
Culver City, 800 Corporate Pointe #150, 
to any new arrivals...
problem solved...
amazing! someone nominate
this news agency for a nobel prize...

ahem, where was i ah yes trying
to jot a note for the sake of
self...darn if only politics
didn't affect us and the future
directly...but it is we the
people that will have to 
deal with the undocumented
crowds as we make our way through
life, it's not like aimee harris
selling the ashley biden goods 
to project veritas and then
head and neck doctor hookup
interfaith services thomas...
so hidden you'd never think
to look it up -

i look at my dream, lucy
had talked about santa monica -
the girl derry playing decameron
the monica from friends perfumed
daughter, but i can't meet her
with the thought of cocolovecock
possibly sprining up of course
most likely it would be the
puppy from the lynch film -
so there i am after "praying"
for a train going to trollhattan -
feeling the rumble and the humming
roar of steel's glide, was i finally
returning to myself, do i actually
love lotta...a whole lotta love,
i played around with led zeppelin
south bound suarez, known to me
as the feeling gucci song...
there was no deadline for 
emilee although one seemed to 
be imposing itself...i simply
must adjust my ego and desire
into a place that doesn't pace
in the waiting space...

my heart awoke light and leaned
into the already curving day -

everything tells me not to 
pen over current events but
i ponder against the point
remarking at the extent
of echoes in time when 
a person rises to "power"
that is to say if we
might prevent a dictator
tyrant lunatic from landing
like say pinochet, caligula, 
or pol pot, would it not
be worth something and as 
i feel the "american" leader
might wield more of a sword than
than anyone mentioned well
everything can go to hell
as it were since it will 
regardless of silence.


the rest is - rest in peace;
helen e woller then courtney
marie daffinrud...

sleeping girls self play
we have a routine a photo
says after the lap dance
gets him hard, daddy fucks
me doggie style on the lounge
room floor hot juggalettes
gone wild...

gee i should be editing 
the screenplay and novel
instead of smoking down
the shadows.

four august twenty four

i had this clear vision - memory
of my room -  standing there
for a second or two, recalling
especially the chain and 
master lock intended for 
safekeeping a school girl
i cannot presently recall -
the stacked mattresses 
that would cost a fortune
to re-establish...where i
left one of my guitars in
its case as if to rest
a while until my return -
it came to me, delivered
with missing songbook pages -
i never got to go back or
escape that place...
in dreams, especially...
in dreams i think it's
either lotta or marta -
a girl like that nearly
taking up an entire side
of me...i am not annoyed, 
yet i am also not sure
what it means...
possibly spies sending
spam emails in our
post modern frenzy...
i also dreamt of emilee
still in love yet
obviously my feelings
are learning to, leaning
towards letting go in order
to understand her -

she has made it nearly
impossible for me to fall 
in love again...


time travel impromptu;
understand, the word sizzles
over a rotary phone, this is
a candidate that is a threat
to national security. there is
a silence as if filling the 
the lungs of consent to breathe
out, sir, oh don't sir me
you have no idea of the strings
pulled and the buttons pushed
back when all this started -
if that son of a bitch even 
gets near to the oval office,
the jig is up, johnson, vitman,
you name it, so UNDERSTAND,
a second man has to be in place,
you can bring up the miami team -
sir, i said don't sir me, you
are distracting me, simply listen;
you can call the patsy sir, it's
the ambassador hotel...
next day it is not a word that
sizzles but the man himself
pacing, a fucking twenty two
caliber round, amatuers, did 
they think he was a toy doll?
don't lift me, for crying out 
loud a whole second unit to
good samaritan hospital as if
i didn't have anything to do
today! it's like the fucking
ghost of his brother was with
him, fucking tracheotomy! fifth
floor, ninth floor - this would make
a great movie, twelve hours
of a zombie kennedy in shock
that we did it again. oh well,
gotta get ready for my meeting
with rich nixon.

back in the kitchen;
			 
i've put the cod fish in water
but i've never done this before...
			 
lucy says she has a spider roommate-
it's raining where lotta knit...
a glance at the news plays out
the media mogul plan, just get
anybody with a name, julia can't
score in film, strictly small time
tv show filler, have her do some
cheerleading israel gasps in shock
is she going to buy real estate
in teheran or what?
and yeah that washed
up friend of fay dunaway, what's her
face, sari stone, put the bribe
right on the table. she'll take it,
just like reuters, lord knows
she needs it - and boom this candidate 
has some
names...

my notes... 


5.8.24

i dreamt of aleksandra akhremenko.
such a lovely soul, it makes me
think inner beauty is reflected
in a person's countenance - 
nothing to do
with make up or fashion...

sheikh hasina had to go -
margaret renkl riffs off
lucy hale - asian robots
ships sailing...
luana alonso mirrored
bangladesh?
			 
 i wondered how all these
companies and corporations
can pull off using open
source ai in their paid 
plans...for a minute i
felt like creating my
own paid plan but that
would make me as bad as
them...i did add a text
creator to the resources
page...free.

if you want to deploy one
yourself here is the front
code in html/java

(i have abbreviated style, script,
and divs so they will be read not
seen...)

then a sort of holder is required in python
a flask type thing like this ;

from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import openai  # Example, replace with actual library if using different models
from transformers import pipeline  # Example, replace with actual library

app = Flask(__name__)

# Initialize models
model1 = openai.ChatCompletion.create(model="gpt-4")
model2 = pipeline('text-generation', model='EleutherAI/gpt-neo-2.7B')

# Model selection logic
def select_model(user_input):
    if len(user_input) < 50:
        return "model1"
    else:
        return "model2"

# Generate response using the selected model
def generate_response(user_input, selected_model):
    if selected_model == "model1":
        response = model1.create(messages=[{"role": "user", "content": user_input}])
        return response.choices[0].message["content"]
    else:
        response = model2(user_input, max_length=150, num_return_sequences=1)
        return response[0]['generated_text']

@app.route('/chat', methods=['POST'])
def chat():
    data = request.get_json()
    user_input = data['message']
    selected_model = select_model(user_input)
    response = generate_response(user_input, selected_model)
    return jsonify({'response': response})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

which means:
	1. Save the HTML code to an index.html file.
2. Save the Python code to an app.py file.
3. Install the required libraries (Flask, openai, transformers) using pip.
4. Run the Flask app with python app.py.
5. Open index.html in a web browser to interact with the chatbot.

	    according to open ai;
"This setup provides a basic web-based interface for your chatbot,
leveraging the power of multiple LLMs."

	it's kinda like astrology, no?

"The new moon in your sign will
encourage you to take the kind
of risks that most people steer 
clear of, but you're not most people..."
	    
i think i get the hype
over the democrat candidate
the powers that buzz and be
want everybody to go gaga
over, it's simply that
well there is no one
that can legally beat trump.

"You know. I've been working here for 44 years.
Ain't nobody ever ordered nothing but T-Bone steak 
and a baked potato. Except this one asshole from 
	New York tried to order trout back in 1987.
	We don't sell no goddamned trout. 
T-bone steaks. So either you don't want the corn
on the cob, or you don't want the green beans. 
So what don't you want?"

there's really nothing i could say
about strictly confidential, i suspect
i missed the reason or there were
too many reasons. like an orgy when
a man is suddenly deflowered...
feeling sour and intent on something
more like a movie - i leaned into
devil's doorway ironically as
three deliveries arrived...
as i sat there with my pie
i wasn't sure if i had made the
right choice yet it sure was
interesting...dog barking at
arriving horse sent me way
back onto farm where that would
happen, except in another epoch,
with incoming vehicles - a weird
greeting...so even if not great,
it gave me much to ponder...
the real wonder of the day
was noticing the david lynch
news - what a year he is having,
if memory serves, a divorce a
few months ago and now the ping
pong report of too ill to 
direct on location followed by
a clarification that he will...
well, i won't say - in my mind
i walk past an actress at a bar
on my way to catch a midnight
premier...i remember i had
dreamt the film before so it
was nearly memorized even before
viewing perhaps for the repeated
watching of whatever his previous
film had been...later when netflix
was mail sitting with mother 
for the long awaited inland
empire...her first, my second 
viewing...no critics can pin 
down certain scenes, because
what scorsese used to do with
painting, he does with dreams...
the trance might last a lifetime
and i suppose i am telling or
overtelling here simply as
a cheerleader - both for
season four and full feature
release - not that he has 
anything to prove...get
well soon won't work here
so i will leave it at that. 
after updating parts of
my domains and setting up
the superstar film for
the eigth...i race into
bed partly intent on 
getting up early which 
i did, not even five in 
the morning yet...in my
dreams i think i am 
walking around with west
sofia...in some mall type
place, department stores...
but i lose her not knowing
if i told her how she reminded
me of mother night, movie not
book. we drink ells. kurt
i still don't know what that
other dream meant. blue fairy
godmother. every exit reveals
new york city sidewalks and i
keep stepping back to get to
here or paris...at some point,
i hear a haunting voice, a woman
but eerie - something about visiting,
she's hovering just above the bed
as i am trying to make contact 
with my hand which for some reason
is going a mile a minute in a sort
of frantic motion as touch feels
i sense it is spirit not flesh 
and awake of course weirded out
in the lotta emilee lucy triangle
that rises from a fantasy which
seems to want to keep me in bed
or return to dreams...
i step out onto the hallway, only
pleased that skirt has taken
the bookshelf as his nap space,
sort of like having a literary cat.
about six months younger than
the director i was purring about -
hiroshima anniversary, the statue
in seattle was stolen a few weeks

therma friedland passed away,

i dreamt i was dead and
mother was dead too, except
i was silent and i could hear
her trying to explain the how
in the mishap of death...

i didn't want to write that
dream, but then i wouldn't
be a writer...

i spend the day against my
will, cleaning up and going
back and forth with the 
ceiling leak in the back 
room...plumber saturday -

still, two excellent moments
making things for lucy and marta -
i kept telling myself vaselina
is fifteen, always want to 
go watch gogol all over again
when i think of her...

i had woken up with lotta yet
it was emilee the minute i
started over-speaking...

rice onion chicken, the master
and margarita - omfg, for a minute
i stumbled in understanding as
naturally the mind reaches for the
book...my first reading i couldn't
put it down...then - i'm not sure
when, perhaps when they revoke
the writer's card - it becomes
clear - they have materialized
bulgakov himself into the film -
but not only that - they play
with the scenes in such a way
so as to prove how powerful 
the book is...and will be...
positively thrilling visuals -
i had to applaud, i had to sigh
in pure cinematic satisfaction.

it's more of a masterpiece, given
that this production was made right
in the midst of operation Z, 
perhaps.

in more of a maybe,
the red rocker robot
and the blue bomber
replacement robot 
agree to oral sex
on ay bee see, leaving
the faux news chanting
station in the rear...
executives crying darn
they're still the one...
the in semen month,
red rocker urging
for two more blow jobs...
the semi- retired blue
bomber puts on his vaudeville
act as the story breaks...
one of the devi-crats
claims she is "psyched"
but don't you need to be
a surfer or at least from 
california to employ that
word...one commentized
thought said 'we just lost
all respect for you' - 

i didn't respect the vienna
swift thing, as if preluded
by the stabbing party, but
when i heard some of the
"facts" it did make me pause
to think...the obvious move
after this near the spy who
dumped me scene...
would be for her to endorse
the red rocker given that they
are now in the brotherhood
of having been targets, and
to some extent survivors...

knit -
	a short story by inky


Come to years for endure...

 Curiosity lost civilization!
	    
 Invaluable lessons would story
	    
telling  unraveled a  lush knit 
	    
by day dusty windows... 
	    
In the quaint city, nestled between rolling structures and lush machinery,
	    
lived a young girl named Leica. She was known for her adventurous fingers
	    
and deep love.
	    
	    
One day, while knitting the wool on the outskirts of her imagination, 
	    
Leica stumbled upon a pool hall, feeling her worst yet

intrigued, she approached the balls and peered at her endgame.
	    
To her surprise, she noticed the cue wiggle. 
	    
	    
Curiosity piqued, Leica carefully stroked the wood as she reached out to
	    
bank.
	    
As the flipped eight sank with am indecipherable curvev. 
	    
She wished she had stayed home knitting with her adventurous fingers.

Determined to leave she slowly found redemption in the darkening

pink blue skies as night disposed of nature's light.
	    

As Leica delved  into sleep, she found herself dreaming
	    
dreams which transcended time and space. 
	    
	    
Had the quaint city, itself like a moving painting
	    
of vivid images made her a witch....
	    
She awoke as the struggle revealed its triumphs
	    
in the form a a call from Mister Spree -

 the captivating excitement of his bewildered confusion, 
	    
tickled her as now sure that even a casual thought
	    
caused him to stay up all night thinking of her...
	    
Of course Mister Spree had tried, even spending 

hours at his architecture desk making draft after

draft of structures that could neither be houses

or buildings...A man possessed, unaware of the 

the spell she had cast...Until, in a state of

frustated shock he shivered into bed haunted

by the evening's failure and feeling her 

adventurous fingers tighten around his neck,

a chokehold that felt so real he awoke thinking

he had died and immediately started debating

over whether to telephone her or not...

her voice was no consolation, he felt exactly

the same...a creativity that produced only

a vagueness...nothing clear save her...

That request was stated 

in the unit of his not working

repairs citing to himself concerns. 
	    
the day felt like 49 days. 
	    
 There is no upstairs to the several floors 

of his desire yet he only hinted
	    
as her extremely blonde became unbearable

not to hold like animals put in a self zoo
	
he kept looking at the reasons thinking

none of them can escape, they must not escape.

meanhile, leica set out to knit inside another

spell that would now bring Mister Spree

to his senses or out of his mind if he happened

to carry on as if he could make it without her.
