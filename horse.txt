<b>A horse Struck Down By Lightning</b>

<em>- a novel in ten chapters</em>
</pre>
## Chapter 1: The Naked Highway (Version one)
<pre>
The phone rang although it was nothing
like a phone anymore... There was no
cord or anything reaching into the
wall, into wires that would meet
other wires and sizzle with a soft
electric vibration... This phone was
a flat mechanism which felt hot
after holding a conversation for
a few minutes...



The heat didnt have time to take
hold.  Put mom on the phone, Ian
asked.  He asked five times before
he understood...

Mom was never
coming to the phone... She is
outside gardening, she went for
a walk, she left in the other car,
she is sleeping... The fact was
even if she came to the phone, it
would not be her.

It would only be
what remained after the ravages of
old age destroyed what she had been,
what he knew as mom... He did not
feel - perhaps-  as he should or
as others might, since the chaos
within this logic could not be
calculated within his mind.

When he finally did speak to her,
he understood further...

It had
to be selfishness.  It was for his
sake - the talk.  He wanted, like
any momma's boy, his mother.

Sure,
he argued within that it eased her
as it brought back memories or
even details that pleased her...
But he could not hide the truth
from himself, nothing could help
her - indeed, nothing could bring
her to the phone.

Around the same time, perhaps even
in that same moment, no pun intended,
he had met Wilhemina.

She was thin,
tall, seemingly frail yet exceptionally
strong except when strumming a guitar
which somehow made her appear short
and clumsy... The farm whispered in
green and several shades of colors
he had not seen in the city.

He felt instant love, a knowing so
powerful that it nearly made him
tremble - but it wasn't her, it
was Evlyn that flashed before his
eyes as he gazed upon this beautiful
blonde woman that talked all night
about horses and sat down playing
g major and a minor chords into the
wild horses verse  which
she mumbled through like a method
actor more concerned with her fingering
- especially at the barre chord in the
chorus...



Evlyn didn't play guitar but that
didn't matter... she was gone and his
mother was never coming to the phone
again and he could not feel love
without Evlyn.

He excused himself.

Bathroom.  Fentanyl.
He was happy again until he found himself
crawling in the middle of the highway
naked, struggling to reach his Ralph
Lauren blue pinstripe two piece suit -
A car hit a motorcycle as he slipped
into his pants.

The dividing line
disappeared and he worried that vehicles
from the other side of the accident
would run him over.  Then, he weighed,
I am already trampled under the burden
of being an American in a country
that gave itself away for foreign
policy, for the police state.  The blazer
felt sharp as it covered his shoulders...


I am already devastated by not having
a true soul to speak with and even when
I find a true soul all I can think of
is her...

The sky was darkening.  He got up,
shirtless and shoeless not even realizing
his mom had been the shirt and Evlyn
had been the shoes.

## Chapter 1: The Naked Highway (Version two)
<pre>
The phone rang,
its sound both familiar and unsettling.


Familiar because its purpose
– to connect, to alert 
– remained unchanged.

Unsettling because the object itself
bore no resemblance 
to the phones of his youth.

This phone was a cold, flat rectangle, 
a slab of glass and metal that grew uncomfortably
warm against his ear after a few minutes,
a subtle burn that mirrored the slow, 
steady ache in his chest.


"Put mom on the phone," Ian rasped, his 
voice thick with disuse
and a creeping dread.  He repeated 
the request five times,
the words turning to ash in his mouth, 
before the truth sunk in,
cold and heavy as a stone in his gut.

Mom wasn't coming to the phone.

Not now, not ever.

She was there, physically present,
somewhere in the labyrinthine
halls of the care facility,
but the woman who answered to "Mom" was
gone.  A cruel twist of fate, 
a head injury years ago, had stolen her
memories, leaving behind a stranger 
inhabiting his mother's
sixty-year-old shell.



He clung to the fantasy:
She was outside gardening,
he told himself,
conjuring images of her strong hands
gently coaxing life from the earth.

Hands that had once held him close, 
soothed away childhood scrapes, and
painstakingly built the intricate 
dollhouses he’d never quite appreciated.
Or perhaps she had gone for a walk,
her silver hair glinting in the sunlight
as she strolled through the park, 
her pace brisk and sure like it had been
in Washington, D.

C. , rallying against the Iran hostage crisis when she
was full of youthful idealism.  He'd been just a boy then,
glued to the television screen, watching her face contorted 
in anger and frustration,
a sea of placards and chanting protesters
a blurry backdrop to his mother's
righteous fury.



Maybe she had taken the other car, 
the old Volvo with the faded paint
and the dented bumper, the one she’d 
stubbornly refused to replace despite
its constant reminders of that rainy night
when a drunk driver nearly took
her from him...  The Volvo was a symbol, 
he supposed, of a bygone era,
a time when things were built to last,
when people valued substance over style.
Not like the soulless, disposable crap
they churned out these days.


The possibilities spun through his mind, a dizzying carousel of what-ifs and maybes.
But the truth, the brutal, undeniable truth, remained.  It was a pale imitation,
a stranger residing within, ravaged by the cruel hand of amnesia.



Her youthful vibrancy, the one that had 
danced to disco music and
later grieved in front of a flickering 
television as the Challenger
shuttle exploded across a clear blue sky,
was now
buried beneath layers of confusion and silence. 
He’d been just a child then,
a boy named for the flautist in Jethro Tull, 
a band she’d adored.

She’d even bought him a flute, bless her heart, 
but he’d wanted nothing to do
with “blowing on a metal pipe,” 
as he’d so eloquently put it.


And the worst part? 
The part that gnawed at him like a hungry wolf?
He wasn't sure he felt as heartbroken as he should.

This erosion of her being,
of their connection, had been happening for so
long that it had become his new normal.

The grief was a dull ache,
a phantom limb pain that never truly faded.
It was easier to numb it, 
to disappear into the warm embrace of fentanyl,
to rail against the injustices of the world, 
to scream into the void about
wasteful NASA programs and an American government 
more concerned with projecting power on foreign soil
than caring for its own.


Giving F-16s to Ukraine without training the pilots?
It was lunacy.  Suicide.

The height of arrogant stupidity.

This country, his country, with its bloated military budget
and its insatiable hunger for oil,  disgusted him.  Dallas,
he understood now how Kennedy must have felt:

the first lady covered in blood as 
dancing bullets waltzed through him, making
the riddle of his back pain feel like
nothing in the face of death's jigsaw puzzle...



When he finally spoke to her caretaker,
a kind woman nameed
Brenda with the patience of a saint,
the realization hit him
with the force of a physical blow. 
It was selfishness that propelled
these calls, a desperate attempt to 
cling to the fading embers of their bond.

He craved the comfort of a voice, 
any voice, that even vaguely resembled hers,
the illusion, however fleeting, 
that everything was alright.



It was around this time, perhaps even in
the same breath that he uttered his goodbyes
to the void on the phone, that he met Wilhelmina. 
She was an ethereal creature,
all long limbs and sharp angles, seemingly fragile
as a spider web yet possessing
a quiet strength that radiated from her very core
– the kind of strength one developed
working the land, battling droughts and floods
and the ever-present threat of a bad harvest.

She talked all night, her voice a low 
murmur against the symphony of
crickets and rustling leaves,
about the language of horses,
the way their eyes held centuries of wisdom,
their gait a poem etched
onto the earth.

She spoke of the land with a reverence
he’d never encountered before,
a deep understanding of the delicate
balance between man and nature.

It was a far cry from the concret
e jungle he called home,
a place where the only connection 
to nature was the occasional
weed pushing up through a
crack in the sidewalk.

He’d initially been drawn to the 
melancholic beauty that clung
to her like woodsmoke  after a bonfire.

She carried herself with a quiet grace,
her movements deliberate and measured, 
as if weighing each step, each gesture,
against some unseen force. 

Her eyes, the color of a stormy sea,
held a depth that both captivated and unnerved him.
They were the eyes of someone who had seen too much,
felt too deeply, loved too fiercely.



Wilhelmina was a woman forged from the earth itself,
her spirit rooted in the cycles of planting and harvest,
of birth and decay.  She spoke little of her past,
but the lines etched around her eyes and the calluses
on her hands spoke volumes. 

She’d weathered her own storms,
he suspected, storms that had stripped away
everything but the essential.



And then, as if drawn by an invisible thread,
she picked up her old Gretsch acoustic guitar. 
Her fingers, calloused and strong from
tending fields, she launched into a halting rendition
of "Wild Horses," her voice catching on the barre
chord in the chorus, playing g major and a minor chords
into the  wild horses verse  which she mumbled through
like a method actor more concerned with her fingering
- especially at the barre chord in the
'couldn't drive me away' chorus...

He saw Evlyn then, clear as day, her mischievous smile
a beacon in the darkness.

Evlyn, who couldn’t tell the
Rolling Stones from the Clash, but filled his world
with music nonetheless.  Evlyn, who was gone.

And his mother, lost in the fog of her own mind,
was gone too.

He couldn’t feel love without Evlyn,
not truly, not completely.  Not anymore.

He excused himself, 
the words catching in his throat like dry leaves.



Bathroom.  Fentanyl.

The familiar numbness washed over him,
a chemical blanket
smothering the pain, 
silencing the roar of his anger,
his grief, his despair.




He was happy, briefly,
blissfully unaware of the chasm opening
beneath his feet.  
Until he found himself on the highway...

Naked.

Crawling.


The asphalt scraped his skin,
a searing reminder of his physical form.
He scrambled for his clothes
– his navy blue pinstriped Ralph
Lauren suit,
a symbol of a life he no
longer recognized –
strewn across the road
like fallen leaves.



His shirt and shoes were nowhere to be found.  
A rusted Ford F-150 roared past,
its headlights momentarily blinding.

A newish, cherry-red Corvette, 
all sleek lines and arrogance,
nearly clipped him as it swerved 
to avoid a charcoal-gray Honda Civic,
its brake lights flashing
like a desperate warning.




A 1965 Cadillac Coupe DeVille, 
gleaming black with a white vinyl roof,
a chrome behemoth from a bygone era.

It moved as if in slow motion,
its massive grill a gaping maw,
a chrome predator bearing down on prey.

He watched, mesmerized, 
as a rider on a Kawasaki Ninja, 
a blur of electric green,
struggled to control the bike 
as it wobbled precariously
in the Cadillac’s wake.



Their eyes met – the rider’s wide with a terror
reflected in Ian’s own – and for a fleeting moment,
the world seemed to hold its breath.

Then, the bike skidded, the rider pitched forward 
like a discarded rag doll,
the screech  of metal against asphalt 
a discordant symphony that echoed in
the stillness that followed.

The dividing line blurred,
a thin white thread separating him from oblivion.



He thought about the cars on the other side, 
imagined the sickening crunch
of metal against bone.  He thought 
about the weight of his own existence,
the suffocating burden of living in a 
country that had traded itself
for fleeting power and empty promises.

The blazer settled on his shoulders,
it felt sharp, this flimsy shield
against the encroaching darkness.



He was already devastated,
trampled under the weight of his grief,
his loneliness a gaping wound that refused to heal.

Even when he found solace, like Wilhemina 
- a kindred spirit in the
vast emptiness, all he could see was Evlyn.

He stood, shirtless and shoeless,
a forgotten player on a stage
lit by the flickering neon signs 
of roadside diners.



He didn’t even realize, not yet, 
that his mother had been the shirt,
a comforting presence against his skin, and Evlyn,
his shoes, grounding him, guiding his steps.

He was adrift, a ship without a
sail on a sea of asphalt.

His tongue felt thick and dry, 
a familiar side effect of the fentanyl.


Or was it the taste of salt water?  
A phantom ocean spray on his face?
The rumble of passing trucks morphed 
into the roar of crashing waves.


He closed his eyes, swaying slightly,  
and for a moment, he was on a ship,
the deck rolling beneath his feet, 
the wind lightly whipping at his hair.

He imagined the vastness of the ocean,
its depths holding secrets older than time
itself.  A century ago, 
this journey would have been commonplace,
a perilous voyage across a churning expanse of water.


No roaring engines, 
no metal birds soaring through the sky,
just the creak of timber, the snap of canvas,
the constant, rhythmic sway of the sea. 
People still sailed,
of course. 

In fact, someone was likely sailing
at this very moment, 
their vessel a tiny speck on the face of the deep,
their fate at the mercy of the winds and the waves.


And beneath the surface, hidden from view, submarines,
sleek metal sharks, sliced through the darkness,
their occupants breathing recycled air,  
dreaming of distant shores.

But unlike the deliberate,
painstaking construction of a ship –
the ribs of oak and cedar meticulously fitted,
the sails painstakingly stitched,
each knot a testament to generations of knowledge 
– the creation of an airplane
felt sterile, rushed, a triumph of
engineering over artistry.  It lacked spirit,
he thought.

It was a machine, cold and unfeeling,
designed to conquer the sky,
not co-exist with it.

He could almost taste the salt spray on his lips,
feel the sting of it in his nostrils. 
Or was that the fentanyl,
playing tricks on his senses?

The ship pitched and rolled,
the timbers groaning in protest. 
He gripped the railing, his knuckles white,
his vision blurring at the edges.
The world tilted, a carnival ride gone wrong.



He closed his eyes, willing the nausea to subside.  
Sea voyages, he mused,
were exercises in patience, in surrender.

You couldn’t fight the ocean, 
couldn't bend it to your will.



Not like you could bend your own body, 
your own mind,
to the will of a
tiny white pill.

He thought of the smooth,
cool surface of the pillbox,
the satisfying click as he’d flipped it open,
the ritualistic way he’d tapped one,
then two, of the tiny tablets into his palm.
He hadn’t even bothered with water,
just tossed them onto his tongue,
let them dissolve like bitter snowflakes.



The oblivion they promised was both 
a blessing and a curse,
a temporary reprieve from the 
relentless onslaught of his
own thoughts.

The fentanyl was a shroud, 
a muffling fog that dulled the sharp
edges of his grief, his anger, his despair.

But it also dulled everything else
– the scent of pine needles
after a rain shower, 
the taste of Wilhelmina’s coffee,
the feel of the wind on his skin.

It turned the world into a faded photograph,
a muted landscape devoid of depth or dimension.

Yet, within that flatness,
within that artificial stillness,
bloomed a perverse kind of beauty. 
Colors vibrated with an
almost hallucinatory intensity.

Sounds, normally mundane and ignorable,
became orchestral, each note distinct 
and shimmering with hidden meaning.


He understood, with a clarity that bordered on the religious,
why some people chased this feeling,
worshipped at the altar of oblivion.

For those fleeting moments,
you weren't just escaping the world,
you were transcending it.



You were no longer bound by the limitations 
of your physical form,
the relentless tyranny of your own mind.

You were pure consciousness, 
adrift in a sea of blissful nothingness.
He opened his eyes, the asphalt 
shimmering beneath the artificial
glow of the fading streetlights.



His bare feet, raw and newly blistered, burned
against the unforgiving heat of the pavement.

The sun was climbing higher in the sky,
a malevolent eye peering down at him.

The distant rumble of thunder, a haunting melody,
pulled him back to the present.



He was still adrift, lost in a different kind of storm,
one that raged not on the open sea, 
but within the confines of his own spirit.

And he had no idea how to navigate its treacherous currents.
At least not with the burning sensation tickling
the soles of his feet.



Walking in a daze as if leaving the wailing within
somewhere with bygone whalers...

A light flickers.

Lucifer stands before him in mirrored dress,
a suit without shirt and shoes...



He smiles and says, "I know your feet are hurting,
I had the same feeling in my knees....
Ian is it?  Well, after falling from heaven....



He laughs pulling out a blue pack of cigarettes
which Ian thinks are Roth's but reading 
the label he sees they say "Soul" -

The devil noticies his curiousity... 

Yes!  a twenty soul pack!

Offering him one.

Ian questions further, before accepting, 

filtered?

Satan nods no,

"I like to smoke them straight...

"

Before Ian can light the unfiltered Soul cigarette
a skinny child appears next to him and jumps on him
as if trying to press her bones against his body...

Old Scratch scolds the kid,
"he hasn't even smoked it yet, 
you lustful little imp... "
Ian goes into a trance, a dream
wherein his erection contradicts his morality...


He feels a sexual excitement which he cannot
entertain since 
-although a demon,
she is a child in his eyes.  
A twelve year old seemingly, even if she was
born centuries before.  An antique, well kept in hell.


A vamipre-like seductress...

The imp moves from one side of his body to the other,
he feels her on both
sides of his ribcage no matter which side she is on.  
Smoke the cigarette, she
urges.

Take my virginity, she implores.

Ian, dizzy with delight and hesitancy,
collapses at the entrance of the farm.

Wilhemina finds him a bit later thinking oh no he's dead,
but intent on reviving him.

TRANSITION NOTES 2SEPTEMBER24
He dreamt of Evlyn.  Inside of her yet awoke
outside, outside of himself even... A strange
inertia took hold of him.



Hours that felt like days went by...

When he finally gathered his wits to wander
about, he first noticed the horses.  Weird,
more than he recalled Wilhemina having, yet
weirder than that was the energetic woman
calling her Helena...



He could hear words in his ears, like
the formation of a poem;

long six when will for i’m worms cold my the
feet body you in underground -

What else could it be, his raised eyebrows
lifted the focus of his hearing;

i’m when six for cold feet underground body
you the long -

The words were moving, but what did they mean;

underground six when cold worms my body will
feet long for i’m -

Ian tried to escape his listening stance but
something haunted him as he wondered how many
ways could fifteen words be rearranged...

perhaps all a poet needed was fifteen words!

It was as if part of Ian had risen like Dante
alongside Virgil but deaf to his tour-guide,
a drug addict lost in his reflection.



The mirror shattered, the possible magic
replaced by actuality, by an accent...

The woman said, "ynhblwajxcem, qslwdc
bdikuxtv etyn ollwdcemetfz
fziktvajdc mnqsaj vfikmnqs
etyn bdlwynaj olikxcaj. " (*1)

Helena turned, responding as if to Ian;

"when i’m six feet underground the worms in
my cold body will long for you.

"

He did not connect this to the audible juxtaposition
that he had entertained merely seconds before...

The horses were silent.  A yellow breeze drizzled
slowly from the blue skies.

Smoke from his cigarette
rose and was rinsed away by that golden wind.

I'm never getting high or drinking again, he felt
hunger as he lied to himself... Already making
mathematical calculations between the supply in
his stash, the next meeting with the pusher whom
he thought of as his dealer, and the cash in his wallet.



Stepping back into the house, he did not see
any food, suddenly missing his shoes and shirt,
the television TMC'd Service de Luxe as Vincent
Price ordered a tube of shaving cream, sang
to Constance Bennett, and paid a dollar thirty
nine as he finished his cream soda.

RESEARCH&FURTHER TRANSITION NOTES 5september24

The grandson of Dr Price's Baking Soda arrived on earth in 1911.

The 27th of May.

Son of the president of the National Candy Company.

Vincent Leonard... English Major, Yale with a minor degree in art history.



He tried teaching and was intent on getting a master's in the

Fine Arts yet he found himself in the London theater subsequently moving

to New York as an actor.  He worked constantly during

late 1930s and through the 1940s but in film.  1950 gave him his first

starring role,  The Baron of Arizona, as well as one of his favorite

film roles where he played Burnbridge Waters.



He lived at 1815 Benedict Canyon  Drive in Beverly Hills

and never stopped working as an entertainer and he was not

shy in terms of the medium;  equally at home in radio and

television in fact going so far as to become a regular on

the game show The Hollywood Squares...

To not mention music would be an error as several recordings

prove - notably in Alice Cooper's Welcome to My Nightmare and

his own cover of The Monster Mash...

Due to his donations, the Vincent and Mary Price Art Museum

was established in 1957, later becoming the Vincent Price Art

Museum.

VAMP.  A real treasure for underrepresented artists...

Mary Grant was his second wife after his marriage to Edith

Barrett in 1938 which produced the acclaimed author and poet

Vincent Barrett Price who would have been nine or ten

at the time of the divorce.



Mary and Vincent were wed in in 1949 and wrote many cookbooks together.

Their daughter, Victoria Price, also a writer but with an inclination

for interior design and religion, can be seen performing as the

reporter in Edward Scissorhands wherein her father played the inventor.

The actors, Mary and Vincent, divorced in 1973 and the following year he wed

Corale Browne who became an American citizen for him while he converted

to Catholicism for her.



(The air hung heavy with the scent of old books and pipe tobacco.
Vincent Price sat in his study, a labyrinth of shelves crammed
with art books and mementos, a testament to a life spent immersed
in the world of art.  His gaze, sharp and inquisitive,
held a hint of weariness.



He was recounting his early days in Los Angeles, a time when the city,
he said, felt like "seven suburbs in search of a city. "
"They looked down upon us," he sighed, "from the East Coast.
They saw California as a cultural wasteland.

"
He had arrived in Hollywood in 1938, a fresh-faced Yale graduate with
a passion for art and a yearning to be part of the creative ferment that
was then sweeping America.  He had a secret weapon: his charm.
He had met some of the most celebrated artists of the day: Stravinsky, Thomas Mann,
and even a young Dennis Hopper, who was then a prop boy at the La Jolla Playhouse.


“It wasn't easy," he said, his voice softening, “to find the right kind of community.
I was in a constant search for something that would ignite a spark,
a shared passion for art. "

The spark had been elusive.

The Little Gallery, a storefront operation in Beverly Hills,
was a delightful failure.  He and his partner, George Macready, a fellow actor,
had served as both salesmen and caretakers.  They had hosted Tallulah Bankhead,
Greta Garbo, and other Hollywood luminaries.

"It was fun," he reminisced, a twinkle
in his eye, "but it was also a bit of a wild goose chase.

The market for art here was just beginning to take shape. "
He had then thrown himself into the Modern Institute of Art,
a venture with the likes of Edward G.

Robinson and Fanny Brice.

Theirs was a noble ambition: to bring modern
art to a city that was still deeply conservative.  "It was a labor of love,
but it ultimately failed," he said, his voice hushed.


"We had no money, no real infrastructure, and the community
was simply not ready for what we were offering. " The city, he felt, was adrift.
It lacked a true cultural core, a place where artists and intellectuals could gather,
share ideas, and inspire each other.


"It was a different time," he said, "a time of enormous potential but a lack of focus.
It was a challenge to create something out of nothing. " He had found a new home
for his passion in East Los Angeles, a community that was raw and unpretentious,
brimming with artistic energy.


He had established the Vincent Price Gallery, a humble room filled with his personal
collection—Picasso prints, pre-Columbian artifacts, African art—an eclectic assortment
of treasures meant to spark a love for art in the young minds of East Los Angeles.
"It was the most satisfactory thing I've ever done,"
he said, his voice full of quiet pride, “because it was a way to give back.
It was a way to remind myself of what I believed in: the power of art to elevate,
to inspire, to connect.

")

Edith went to the afterlife in 1977, She had become such an expert at manipulating

her age that even the New York Times reported her as being 64 when in fact she was 70...

They, Corale and Vincent, were together until she passed away in 1991 two days after

his birthday.  He would arrive in eternity two years later.

Mary Grant died in 2002.

( talent and versatility home whose story is successful candy magnate provided a life

beyond the unsettling boundaries that embrace complexities

of life and art of life or art  exploration like the occult untamed

beauty hidden world legacy of fascination this  glimpse resonates

through the impact of the view Ian saw outside just like

the drawing UNTITLED HORSES AND BUFFALO

but without the bison... )


Ian went to sleep hungry.

He dreamed of soup.  Drooling

awake he found Helena trying on white ice skates.

Grandmother had even saved their original red case.



Antiques, yet he thought he was still dreaming and

circled back to the couch where he continued to dream.

A fat man and a skinny girl at the front door.  The

corpulent fellow is placing a white tube on the handle.



He feels confounded by his own dream - then it turns

violent as he is given a pair of fine dress socks

with a fancy French label another man storms in

trying to take them for himself.  Ian fights him in

the dream yet in his rush to keep the gift he cannot

reach the knife to make matters worse for the intruder

and awakes with the hesitation that found him debating

against trying to strangle the thief with his bare hands.

He doesn't have a place for these people in his dreams

within his memory.

He settles himself and turns on the

sofa.  Drifting into another dream, he is told that his

ex girlfriend has been given a role in a film.  There is

a video projected onto a tv set.

A close up of her face

as if a makeup artist is touching up her blush.  She

does not look good, he thinks.  Her dark hair missing

the bangs he considered signature.

He tries to look

beyond the screen but cannot.  Darlene, well at least

it was now someone whom he had known.  He wanted to

speak to her but she was in the television so he

talked to himself.

The sounds, of the words he had

heard before Helena put them together, again rising

in his thoughts... when i'm sixty four, no, that was

the lonely heart's band song... when the long worms

under cold feet still sex, no, it was six he was

sure.



He was starting to make the connection yet

in a vague manner.  He was also starting

lose sight of Wilhemina and even Evlyn.

His eyes, or rather his vision was

seemingly enslaved by Helena except she

was not in his dream but even absent

he felt her call as if a summons to

surrender all other desires -

Summer was facing the fall and the

semen in him now felt like a riot

within his testicles -

Suddenly, he wanted Helena but all he saw

was the tv set...

Darlene's movie playing without

sound, he got up from the couch in his dream

to either turn off the monitor or rub his

erection against it.  He awoke then without

any exact recall of any of it as he shuffled

back into reality - drowsy and somehow no

longer hungry inside a house that he did not

know which led him to venture out in order

to pee... For an instant remembering the soup

which made him drool.



Meanwhile, Helena was speaking with the mystery

woman.  Well, she was listening more than talking.

The mystery woman said, "arajdc.

lwmn lwdc vfetajmnlwux,

ozxymn olethbfzdc uxikxcxcetmn dcvfajiktv. "

Helena was defensive as she brushed her hair away

from her shoulders, "You can't expect anyone to

to wait for worms to start a conversation because

of poem. "

The mystery woman squeezed her eyebrows together

and responded; "dcetfzaj vfajetvfbdaj mniktvaj

"

Helena now facing scientific fact, gave her

some satisfaction;

"All right, but even so, it is not impossible

and besides that it perfectly conveys the feeling. "

The mystery woman paused, knowing that she

was at her wits end and sighed;

"Emet aretxy hbajikbdbdar olikxcmn qslwfz

mnet mnqslwxctv etyn olethbfzdc olqsajxc qsaj

mnqslwxctvdc etyn aretxy? "

Well, Helena also sighed but a deeper breath

- an air that knew there could be little common

ground between poetry and science...



Still, she was content, as the spell had proved

itself set and Ian would surely do anything she

asked...

But the mystery woman's point left a shadow...

A shadow that was wise as it understood that

in fact Ian might repeat the words to someone

else and in doing so unexpected consquences

might flash out into the "literal" mind of

another and therein even become a joke...



She did not want this happen but knew that

it was possible and so - in a manner of speaking -

agreed to agree with the disagreeable fact.

Ian, by now, had learned to navigate the house.

He was about to swallow some more of his favorite

potion as the gleaming light bulb electrified

itself giving light to the old lavatory and making

two western ribbon snakes, which were lounging

in the nearly full bath tub, hiss at him.



He shut the door as he stepped away from what he

viewed as the spirits of Helena and the mystery

women.  Two women, two serpents... He longed to

be with Wilhemina, well, really with Evlyn...



Or even making love to Darlene on the tv, anything

but this witchery!  He was yet calm until the imp

pulled at his recollection.  That feeling of bone

against his skin...

No one had really hugged him

since grade school, not with such force... It was

as if the devilish lolita had left a tattoo upon

his ribcage which was invisible except for the

needling that remained now reanimated by a fright.

He looked down at the floor as if it were a map

that would tell him which way to turn.

He did not

remember what had happened within that embrace but

it must have been something to still fire up

such a feeling.  A light crossed the floor's

cinnamon boards and he looked up to see Helena.

She smiled, breathing in, at him with

desire in her eyes.



Suddenly, he felt like himself, yes he thought -

anything you say.  In fact, he even heard the worms

slowly wiggle out words.. She is not an ophidian,

she is not ophic, she is of your own heart's

love.

IN CHAPTER THREE...

## Chapter 2: Tango
  
Helena had left.  Left had Helena to a place she

only mentioned as her best friend's house.

A brown handbag bizzarely adorned with

wooden clothes pins was left behind as if to

haunt Ian, to remind him that she was

intent on returning to finish this homemade

fixing, this drying glue at some of the worn

edges that had come to resemble little leather

mouths attempting conversations beyond the

purse.



Within the purity of his newfound unknowingness,

he imagined them, the clothes pin, as worms

which indeed felt to his ear as if speaking...

Well, not the words which he kept trying to

comprehend as they revolved in his thoughts

as if needing to be mused over, memorized,

to be the only music he could dance to -

The thought stopped his thinking.  A dancer?



Was he a dancer?  He couldn't be sure.


Suddenly an impulse to attempt a sliding

sort of tango giro step into a split led him

to grab the energetic mystery woman from

the couch potato creature she had become

while Helena was away...



His legs tingled as he dared to revolt

against the put together pixels scrambling

his thoughts which she seemed to love...

He pulled her as if possessed and her legs

followed his with a sort of upsidedown

smile that refused to give any hint

of herself, but Ian didn't care what

she might make of this boldness, of this

carefree exploration, of this forced

gesture... He jolted himself as he felt

a return to when the television felt

friendly as in the dream of his ex or

even "Service Deluxe," still the noise

that had crept in while Helena was gone

held sway in his bloodstream as if

they had outnumbered oxygen in the air...



Stil, he was shaking them off;

The scenes had already surrendered to

his blenderesque mind

which turned -----

the awfully dizzying "My First Film,"

the innuendo riddled "Rain," (wherein

he actually saw himself as Joan Crawford)

the sexually charged Russian "Succubus,"

a series of orgiastic news teasers along

with actual news of Taylor Swift doing

nothing anyone could logically explain

given the already overflowing library

of Swifties this that and the other

tidbits - given the death tolls that

were broadcast without any celebrity

urgency... what was a tanker explosion

overseas... what were forty thousand

dead Palestinians...

what was Ukraine

without an after tour press spree?

a show called "The Bear" with an actual

man more ursidaen than human save for

a moustache, some debate over accepting

an obviously inept candidate or burning

down the country in which he couldn't help

but giggle as he recalled some distant

history lesson where the buffalo were

exterminated to starve the native indians,

Ian thought, the war of Independence was

burning down England and maybe France too,

the Civil war was even worse and these

talking heads would rather vote for idiots

well - sinister flimflam professionals posing

as idiots, he corrected his train of thought -

terribly selfish fools would rather hold

the party line than rebuild the land...

A band called the  Presidential debate played last,

the heavy makeup weighing the notes down, it was a man

and a woman but neither of them said anything

that would cause a revolution, they didn't even

talk fast as would be the norm say in a bar or

a dorm - no, in fact when flustered their speech

slowed as if trying to serve that one soundbyte

which would get their finger on the bomb...



boom
-----into a weird, expanding, collage,

instead of entertainment

and politics (although nobody could tell the two

classes apart) with another clown presidency on the way.

Did they even need to Charlie Alpha Red signal

the secret for some gung ho military honcho

to put his head down and press that end of

world party button or could they merely

imagine it and bang... Yes, sure, Ian judged,

it was like having a million dollars but

still taking the bus simply for the vibe.



The energetic mystery woman detonated into a

split alongside Ian who took a long couple

of seconds to slide his hand gently from her

thigh to her ankle as the suddenly upturned skirt

waited to leave the wild scene it encountered

by surprise as Ian realized he might be a dancer

or at least someone that had taken enough lessons

to easily perform a forward cross and drag his

partner into a nearly full split.

The mystery woman remained silent through it

all, ruffling down the rifled cloth that covered

her legs down to the knees, she stood only to

sit again in front of the glowing sound box

which kept having something to offer hour after

hour, day after day.

Her skin, to his touch, had felt neither hot

nor cold.

It was like touching a vape which

smoked out without a reaction in itself.

The ashes in his mind's eye scattered, that

media cigarette made his soul cough and it

resounded in his brain's hearing as an echo

without purpose.  A strange repetition of

nonsense or even songs he didn't exactly

like...

A fast food commercial jingle juggled

against 'never gonna give you up' which he couldn't

decide what it might mean - mafia vows?  his ex

in a telepathic seance telling him forever?

Some of the other lyrics were 'We've known
each other for so long /Your heart's been aching,
but you're too shy to say it
Inside, we both know what's been going on
We know the game and we're gonna play it...

"

But they would have been foreign to him like
French in a Greek diner.  DO I LOOK LIKE I GOT
A BAGUETTE, MONSIOUR?  YOU WANT I SHOULD CHECK
THE INSIDE OF MY BUTT FOR SOME BREAD, HUH -

He must have heard the song at some point,
somewhere...

He didn't think it might have been
a tune from his earliest days, from his infancy.
Heard it through his mom...

Yet, he only associated her with Jethro Tull.


But it had to be from those days before he was
aware of himself, before he realized what
he was and what he wasn't and started hiding it.

For a minute, in the middle of that echoing,
it all felt so silly... What was the next line?



Never gonna give you up or hurry you or hurt
you or who knows... Truly even tortured he
could only guess.

He didn't have to guess about hope, however,
there was hope in the telephone, that phone
call to his mother..

Oh, no that was only him
pleasing himself.  A masturbation of the emotions
to ejaculate into even more masks.

Was he, even now, telling himself he was a dancer
so he wouldn't have to tell himself he was a drug
addict.



A drug addict now holding a double need with the
desire for Helena and even for her worms.

The world met another midnight and she made the
front door's opening and closing clatter sound like magic.

Like magic, Helena had arrived while a smile broke
through Ian's present mask.

The American Century:
A Case Study in Interconnectedness and Unintended Consequences
by Dr.  Emily Finch

As a historian seeking to understand the complex interplay of global events,
I find myself drawn to the American century, a period marked by both unparalleled
progress and profound upheaval.  This era, characterized by American global dominance
following World War II, presents a fascinating case study in interconnectedness and
unintended consequences.



To accurately assess its impact on England, we must delve into the intricate web
of events that unfolded across the Atlantic, examining both the perceived
good and the undeniable bad.

My initial research focused on the tragic decimation of the American bison,
a seemingly isolated event with far-reaching consequences.  The systematic
extermination of this iconic species, driven by greed, westward expansion,
and a desire to subdue Native American populations, was not a spontaneous occurrence.


It was a deliberate policy of extermination, fueled by a combination of factors,
including the relentless hunt for hides, the introduction of diseases by settlers,
and the disruption of migration patterns through railroad construction.

This policy, endorsed by the US government, aimed to cripple Native American
resistance by eliminating their primary food source.  The impact resonated across
the Atlantic, disrupting the lucrative trade of bison hides, a cornerstone of
many English merchant enterprises.

This economic disruption served as a stark
reminder of the interconnectedness of global economies and the unforeseen
consequences of American actions.

The American Revolution, a pivotal moment in the nation's history,
further underscored this interconnectedness.  While the Americans fought for
independence, their success sparked a wave of revolutionary fervor across
Europe, including England.

The ideals of liberty and self-determination,
championed by the American revolutionaries, resonated deeply with segments
of English society, fueling calls for greater representation and reform.
This, in turn, led to a period of political instability in England as the
ruling class, fearing the spread of revolutionary sentiment, implemented
stricter social control measures, increased surveillance, and cracked
down on dissent.  Key figures like Edmund Burke and Thomas Paine,
both deeply engaged in the debates of the time, articulated opposing
viewpoints.

Burke, a staunch critic of the French Revolution, warned
of the dangers of radicalism, while Paine, a fervent supporter of both
the American and French revolutions, advocated for democratic reforms in England.

The American Civil War, a brutal conflict over the issue of slavery,
further deepened the entanglement of the two nations.  While many
English citizens were appalled by the institution of slavery,
the war had a profound impact on their livelihoods.

The Union
blockade of Southern ports, aimed at crippling the Confederacy's
economy, disrupted the flow of cotton imports to England, leading
to widespread unemployment in the textile industry.  This economic
disruption, coupled with the loss of a key trading partner,
significantly impacted the British economy, highlighting the
fragility of international trade networks and the interconnectedness
of nations.  Furthermore, the war divided public opinion in England,
with many supporting the Union and others sympathizing with the Confederacy,
underscoring the complexity of international relations.



However, the American century did not end with the Civil War.
The United States emerged from the conflict as a powerful nation,
its influence extending to every corner of the globe.  This rise to
global power marked a significant shift in the balance of power,
with England's influence waning as the United States emerged as
a leading economic and military force.

This era saw the rise of
new international institutions, like the United Nations,
heavily influenced by American ideals.  These institutions,
while often seen as positive developments, also represented
a shift in the global order, with the United States playing a
dominant role in shaping their agenda.

The post-American century era, though marked by a less direct
influence, still saw the ripple effects of America’s rise.


The US played a key role in rebuilding Europe after World War
II and contributed to the spread of democratic ideals around
the world.  However, American foreign policy, driven by Cold War
tensions, also led to interventions in various countries, often
resulting in instability and conflict.

The American century, therefore, presents a complex and nuanced
historical narrative.

The impact on England, far from being simple
or unidirectional, was a complex interplay of economic disruptions,
political upheavals, and a changing global order.  While the period
brought forth significant challenges, it also served as a catalyst
for social and political reforms in England and contributed to the
rise of new international institutions.

It is challenging to declare definitively whether the overall impact
of the American century on England was primarily positive or negative.


The answer lies in understanding the intricate web of interconnected
events, the unintended consequences, and the complex interplay
of forces that shaped this era.  Further research is needed to fully
comprehend the long-term effects and assess whether the gains
outweighed the losses.  This understanding, however, is crucial
to informing our understanding of globalization and the intricate
dance of nations in a world increasingly interconnected.

## Chapter 3: The Ironik Jest

If I were to call you a hoofed quadruped thing, what might you think?

Perhaps if i added 'from the genus equus', it might give you even more of a pause.

I suppose it would be relative to your horse sense, in this case meaning a bit more

intellect than common sense.

The story, my iron horse, as it were, slows here like a

freighter at some awaited junction, as I unveil myself to present your narrator.



Correction, your story...  Although I yet feel the possessive feeling of ownership;

I am also keenly aware of how a copyright is not only literally temporary but

entirely at the mercy of dear readers, if you do not feel as possessive of the

creation as the creator then it is a construction without feathers, in the Dickensonian

sense of hope.

(E.

not C.  ) In other words, without a rider all the pony poetry would

wither away far from immortality's gallop.

Express mail returned to sender...



I have not lettered in a few days possibly knowing the task is beyond me,

beyond anyone in fact, because to conjure the word horse itself conjures

worlds and spirits like a maze one could muse over for a thousand years

without realizing a millenia has gone by...  As if Stallions and Mares had to

prove their worth as equal to any muse or in some cases superior to them

in more realms than some might be reluctant to admit...

I am reluctant

to admit my lack of knowledge of Colts and Fillies and the missed history

lessons concerning horses...

Maybe, I took the time to wait, hoping for a

miracle, which obviously is left for you to make whole.   In its entirety,

it is inexplicable...

Yet, I am not.

I have seen Lonely Are The Brave and

furthermore I have felt it.   Itself justifying my typing as it understands

the metaphor of nearly anachronistic lone rider and horse meeting

the post-modern grimace of speed and steel which has only become

ceaseless since that fine production.

Yes, I know, you might not have

seen that movie, but I also know you have sensed the overwhelming

city frenzy which gives no quarter to individuality and often extends

into the countryside...

For proof, give yourself the estimated fact that feral

or wild horses numbered over two million in the nineteenth century and

only seventeen thousand remained by the time laws were established

to protect them.   Now, to conclude this prelude, please accept the

hard truth that humanity has been extremely harsh to the saddled

horse and equally as cruel to the unsaddled.




"This needs closer examination.



In fact, it needs a nightgown.  "

- Quincy Adams Wagstaff




## INTRODUCTION_CHAPTER_THREE_START


Xenophon whose fragments survive in a manuscript at Cambridge...



is possibly mentioned in Aristophanes' Knights...



When one researches 'horses', Xenophon and Kikkuli are the two names

that stand out in terms of ancient history.

As a narrator, I could not see how to weave these authors into the text...



I could see a Hittite praying to a spirit in the clouds called  Kamrušepa

for medicine, for magic while holding the book that is even today a refrence point

in horse training even if few can agree on the exact method...



Kikkuli hailed from the land of Mittani...   and wrote or dictated over a thousand

lines on four cuneiform stones...

"Mighty Kamrušepa, heal my horse's fractured leg

with the air of your holiness...

"  Did the goddess save the book instead?

Looking down and seeing the notes but not the equus caballus...



The one toed animal dwindled through the ages yet the notes flourished even

in far away lands.





(It is not only possible but very likely that cavalry officers were all well acquainted with
Kikkuli's thoughts on
horses if not also with Xenephon...  )




## GENESIS_AND_REVELATION_CHAPTER_THREE_START


The sun hung low in the sky, casting long shadows across the snow-covered plains

of the Eastern Front.

It was the afternoon of January 18th, 1915, a Thursday,

and the bitter air hung thick with the smell of smoke and death.

For weeks,

the Russian Army had been locked in a brutal struggle with the Austro-Hungarian

forces around the town of Izbushensky.

The 1st Regiment of the Imperial Russian Guard Cavalry, known as the "Horse Guards,"

had borne the brunt of the fighting, their dashing blue tunics and white breeches stained

with the grime of battle.

Their steeds, magnificent Don Cossack horses, were weary,

their flanks slick with sweat and their nostrils flared in the freezing air.

But the men,

hardened by years of service and fueled by a fierce loyalty to their Tsar, remained steadfast.

The Austrians had pushed them back, forcing them to take up a defensive position on

a frozen lake, its surface barely strong enough to support the weight of the charging

horsemen.

But their commander, General Pavel Pleve, refused to yield.



He believed, with unwavering conviction, that one last, desperate charge could turn the tide of the
battle.

The order for the charge came at 4:00 PM, the frigid air trembling with the clang of

the regimental bugle.

As the horses surged forward, their hooves kicking up plumes

of snow, the riders leaned low, their sabers glinting in the fading light.

The men,

a mix of young recruits and battle-hardened veterans, were a symphony of grit

and determination.   They roared their battle cry, a primal sound that echoed across

the frozen plains, shaking the very ground beneath their feet.



The scene was one of breathtaking beauty, a tableau of courage and despair.



The Don Cossack horses, their magnificent steeds, were truly a sight to behold.

Their powerful bodies, bred for strength and endurance, were covered in a thick

layer of winter fur, their manes flowing in the wind like a storm of snow.



Their eyes, filled with both courage and fear, reflected the setting sun,

as if imbued with the very spirit of the Russian Empire.



The charge, though spectacular, proved futile.   The Austrian machine guns,

positioned on the high ground overlooking the frozen lake, laid down a deadly barrage.



The horses, already weary from weeks of fighting, were cut down, their bodies strewn

across the ice like fallen giants.

The men, brave and resolute, fought on, their sabers flashing,

their cries lost in the deafening roar of gunfire.

By the time the charge was over, the lake was littered with the bodies of men and horses.



General Pleve was among the fallen, a testament to his bravery and the futility of his plan.



The last cavalry charge at Izbushensky, a spectacle of gallantry and tragedy, marked the end

of an era for the Russian cavalry, a poignant reminder of the brutal reality of modern warfare.

The once mighty Don Cossack horses, the symbols of Russian power and resilience,

lay dead,  their spirit forever frozen in the frozen lake of Izbushensky except for

one lucky mare that escaped the carnage.





1,000 kilometers (621 miles) away - twenty seven years later...





August 26, 1942 Izbushensky; one of the last successful cavalry charges

in modern military history...  General Viktor Sergeevich Golikov was in command

of the 3rd Cavalry Corps defending the Don River crossing...



The Axis's Case Blue aimed at capturing the oil fields and the industrial center.



The Soviet forces were in retreat, desperately trying to slow the German advance.

The 5th Don Cossack Guards Cavalry Division was among the units in that corps

led by Colonel Ivan Panteleimonovich Surov who encountered elements of the

16th Motorized Infantry Division near Izbushensky with an already established defensive

strategy of machine guns, mortars, and several tanks.



Instead of engaging in a prolonged firefight, Ivan ordered a cavalry charge!




At  5:30 AM, approximately 2,000 mounted Cossacks charged across the open steppe

towards the front lines.   The sight of hundreds of horsemen emerging from the morning mist caught

the Axis off guard.




(Russia seemed to be responding to the Italian playbook!

Had they brought out
these stallions and mares so that the fight would carry on throughout
history...  Tourists in Volgograd arrive to see the place of the last
true cavalry charge, some celebrating the savoia cavalleria -which I
will tell you about soon enough- and others savoring the nostalgic
bravery of the mounted cossacks.

Often the some and others do not
know the contrasting conflict...

Morever, if a casual browser were
to look it up he or she would find one or the other battle and
hardly think to search for another...  Why would they?

There it is
the battle of izbushensky!

Yet, there are two and as you have
noticed a third and earlier example which obviously Surov did
not consider or recall before going all out gun ho at that salvo...  )


The speed and ferocity of the attack overwhelmed the defenders.



In close quarters, the mobility of the horses and the skill of the Cossack riders proved

advantageous against the infantry.




The charge lasted about 20 minutes.   Despite facing machine gun fire and grenades,

the Cossacks managed to break through, causing significant casualties and confusion.



They destroyed several artillery pieces and captured a number of prisoners.



However, the success came at a high cost with estimates ranging from 200 to 400 men

killed or wounded.   Colonel Surov himself was seriously injured during the charge.



The cavalry charge at Izbushensky, while tactically successful, did not significantly

alter the overall strategic situation.

The Axis advance continued, and

Stalingrad would soon be under siege.   However, the  action delayed the Axis forces and

provided valuable time for other Soviet units to regroup and establish new defensive lines.




This event is remembered as a testament to the bravery and tenacity of the Soviet cavalry forces.



It demonstrated that under specific circumstances, cavalry could still play a role in modern warfare
,

particularly in the vast open spaces of the Eastern Front.

The charge at Izbushensky remains one of the last significant cavalry actions in military history.



As armies became increasingly mechanized, the role of horse cavalry diminished,

making this engagement a poignant finale to centuries of mounted warfare tradition.




## TWO_DAYS_EARLIER_CHAPTER_THREE_START


The Savoia Cavalleria was an elite regiment with a long and distinguished history,

tracing its roots back to 1692.   It was part of the traditional Italian aristocratic military

class and had fought in various conflicts, including World War I.

By 1942, cavalry had

largely been relegated to reconnaissance and auxiliary duties in modern armies, but in

the sparsely populated, wide-open Russian steppe, there was still a role for mounted troops.



The regiment was equipped with sabers, pistols, and carbines,

although much of their gear was outdated, and the horses themselves were ill-suited

for the brutal Russian winters that would soon follow.   Morale remained relatively high

despite deteriorating conditions, partly due to the regiment's rich history

and pride in its traditions.




The village of Izbushensky was a strategic point along the Don River,

where the Italian cavalry found themselves

pinned down by superior Soviet forces.

On the morning of August 24,

the Italian position was under heavy attack from

Soviet troops, supported by tanks and machine guns.   The Italians,

with few motorized vehicles and artillery, were in an

increasingly desperate situation.

The Soviets, sensing a breakthrough, pressed their advantage.




Facing an imminent collapse of their lines, Colonel Alessandro Bettoni Cazzago, commander of the

Savoia Cavalleria, made a daring and almost suicidal decision: he ordered a full-scale cavalry

charge to break the Soviet advance and disrupt

their forces.   This was not merely a tactical maneuver but a bold gesture rooted in

centuries of cavalry tradition, an attempt

to restore initiative and save his men from annihilation.



At 6:30 a.

m.  , under the rising sun, approximately 600 horsemen of the

regiment were assembled for the attack.




The Axis, wielding their sabers and riding their battle-worn horses,

charged directly at the Soviet infantry positions.



The cavalry was divided into multiple squadrons, each tasked with attacking specific

Soviet positions in a coordinated, high-speed assault.


The Soviet forces, equipped with modern firearms and supported by machine guns,

were caught off guard by the spectacle  of cavalry galloping toward them.

Despite

their technological superiority, the sudden shock of the charge created confusion

in the Soviet ranks.

The first squadron, led by Major Alberto Litta Modignani,

crashed into the Soviet trenches, cutting down infantrymen with sabers as they advanced.

The regiment used speed and surprise to close the gap between them and the enemy,

limiting the effectiveness of Soviet firearms in the chaos of the charge.



After the initial impact, the regiment's second and third squadrons followed,

exploiting the breach in the Soviet defenses.

Even against modern rifles and machine guns,

the Italian cavalry managed to inflict significant damage.   The charge bought critical time,

allowing the Italian infantry to regroup and reposition.

The Soviets, surprised by the ferocity

and unexpected nature of the assault, withdrew to regroup.




The charge, while tactically limited in its success, was a remarkable act of bravery

that temporarily halted the Soviet advance at Izbushensky.   In the process, 32 Italian cavalrymen

were killed, including Major Litta Modignani, who died leading his squadron in the thick of battle.



The regiment inflicted significant casualties on the Soviets,

reportedly killing 150 and capturing 600 prisoners.



The action also bought the Italians precious time to stabilize their defenses.

Colonel Bettoni Cazzago and the Savoia Cavalleria were celebrated for their courage and discipline.



The charge was not a decisive victory in the larger scheme of the Eastern Front, but it became a sym
bol

of the resilience of Italy's military forces, despite their many hardships.

It was one of the last
cavalry

charges in modern military history, embodying a passing era of warfare, where centuries-old tactics

met the brutal realities of 20th-century mechanized combat.

For the Italians, this charge became a point of national pride, immortalized in both military

history and popular memory.

It highlighted the importance of morale, tradition, and leadership in

desperate situations, and it left an enduring legacy in the annals of the Italian military.



The Battle of Izbushensky and the charge of the Savoia Cavalleria stand as a poignant reminder

of the human element in war, where courage and sacrifice can defy overwhelming odds,

even in the face of near-certain defeat.




## CONTEXT_CHAPTER_THREE_START

Antiquity (c.

3000 BCE - 476 CE):

Early Domestication: The domestication of horses revolutionized warfare.


They provided speed, strength, and mobility that allowed armies to travel farther,
transport supplies, and strike with greater impact.
Chariots: In ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, and Greece, horses were used
primarily to pull chariots, which became formidable weapons of war.


Cavalry: As warfare evolved, mounted warriors (cavalry) gained prominence,
wielding swords, lances, and bows.


Gender: While there were likely both male and female horses used in warfare,
mares were often preferred for their strength and endurance, while stallions w
ere seen as more temperamental.

Medieval Period (c.

476 - 1485):

Knights and Chivalry: Horses were central to the concept of chivalry.


Knights relied on them for combat, jousting, and tournaments.
Heavy Cavalry: The dominant force was heavy cavalry, composed of
heavily armored knights riding powerful warhorses.


Gender: Stallions were generally favored for their strength and size,
especially for the weight of the knight and armor.

Mares were
sometimes used, but they were often less prized for combat roles.

Early Modern Period (c.

1485 - 1800):

Firearms and Artillery: The introduction of firearms and artillery began
to shift the emphasis away from close-quarter combat and towards ranged
warfare.

Horses were still important for mobility and reconnaissance, but
their role in direct combat began to decline.
Light Cavalry: Light cavalry units emerged, employing
speed and mobility to harass enemy lines, conduct scouting,
and deliver swift attacks.


Gender: The choice of stallion or mare often depended on the specific
role of the cavalry unit.

Light cavalry might use mares for agility and speed,
while heavier units might still favor stallions.

19th Century:

The Napoleonic Wars: Napoleon's armies still relied heavily on cavalry,
employing them in various roles, including reconnaissance, charges, and pursuit.


The Rise of Mechanization: The development of railways, telegraph, and,
later, the internal combustion engine began to transform warfare.



20th Century:

World War I: Cavalry still played a significant role in the early stages of the war,
particularly on the Eastern Front.   However, trench warfare and machine guns
made direct charges increasingly difficult and costly.


World War II: Mechanized warfare dominated the conflict.

While some cavalry
units were still used, their roles were limited to reconnaissance, patrolling,
and anti-partisan operations.

Important Note:

Horse Breeding: Selective breeding played a crucial role in developing warhorses.


Farmers and breeders focused on traits like strength, stamina, and temperament
to create horses best suited for military service.



The Decline of Cavalry: The increasing dominance of mechanized warfare
led to the decline of cavalry in the 20th century.   While horses still played
a role in some conflicts, their traditional role as a primary force in warfare
was largely over.




## POV_CHAPTER_THREE_START 

The wind bit at my flank, searing my winter coat, each gust a whisper of the coming storm.



It was January, the air thick with the sting of snow, and the ground beneath my hooves was a

frozen expanse of white.   The battlefield, they called it.



I'd felt the tremors in my fetlocks, the earth shaking with the thunder of hooves,

the cries of men, the stench of fear and gunpowder.

Our regiment, the Horse Guards,

stood poised, a wave of blue and white uniforms against the frozen sky.   But we were weary,

our muscles tight with tension, our nostrils flared, scenting the coming blood.



A bugle call, sharp and piercing, sliced through the frozen air.

It was the order.   The order to ch
arge.



My heart hammered against my ribs, a drum against my barrel.

The ground beneath my hooves blurred

as we surged forward, a torrent of bodies and steel.   I felt the man on my back lean low, gripping 
m
y mane,

his voice a guttural roar.

But I was already lost in the maelstrom, my eyes glued to the horizon,

my ears ringing with the symphony of chaos.



Rifles roared.   Snow erupted around me, a white inferno.

Horses screamed,

their cries a chilling symphony.

They fell, their legs contorted, their eyes glazed with terror.

My own flanks felt the sting of lead, my mane matted with blood.



But I held on.

For my rider, for the Tsar, for the honor of the Don Cossacks.

The world spun, a dizzying blur of blood and ice, until I stumbled, the ground a searing pain

against my knees.

I lay there, gasping, my rider gone, his limp form lost beneath the snow.



The world was a canvas of crimson and white, a silent scream.   I was alone, the wind whistling

through my mane, the chill seeping into my bones.



I thought of  myself as Pegasus.

The winged horse of Greek mythology,

born from the blood of Medusa, who was known for his speed and strength.

There I was reborn from the blood of battle!




Spring came, as it always did, with a tentative touch.

The warmth of the sun, the smell of green gr
ass,

the chorus of birdsong.   It was a time of healing, a time of rebirth.

I had survived, scarred and broken,

but alive.

And I carried within me the promise of new life.

The colt arrived in the summer, a bundle of fur and fire.

I named him Starshine, for the way his coat

shimmered in the sunlight.

He was my world, my legacy, the echo of my own spirit.

The years flew by, measured by the changing seasons, the touch of his soft nose against my flank,

the rumble of his growing muscles.

Starshine, my colt, had become a stallion, a magnificent creature,

his coat the color of storm clouds, his eyes like twin pools of fire.



He carried the legacy of the Don Cossacks, the blood of our ancestors in his veins,

the spirit of the charge in his every step.   He was a warrior, a fighter, born to the saddle,

a testament to our enduring spirit.



The call came again, a different kind of call, a different kind of war.

It was 1942, the air thick

with the smell of oil and burning metal.   Starshine, his coat now a tapestry of scars,

his eyes gleaming with the fires of battle, stood at the head of a new regiment.



They were not knights on gleaming chargers, but men in steel helmets, their faces grim,

their eyes filled with a strange, desperate fire.



Starshine charged into the dawn, a wave of fury against the enemy.

The ground trembled, the air vibrated with the roar of engines and the crack of gunfire.



I watched, from the safety of the steppe, my heart a drum in my chest.




Aircraft overhead hummed, yet my eyes were fixed on his powerful flanks,

his muscles rippling with strength, his mane a storm against the wind.

He was my son, my legacy, a testament to the enduring spirit of the Don Cossacks,

a warrior born from the ashes of a battlefield.



I watched, and I prayed.

I prayed for him to come back.

I prayed for him to survive.

I prayed for the fire in his eyes to never be extinguished.



I prayed for him to bring peace to this world that had stolen so much from us.

I prayed to Sleipnir: The eight-legged horse of the Norse god Odin,

known for its magical powers and ability to travel between realms.



Sleipnir, I implored, save my Starshine, save my son...



But, oh, the cost of war, it never ends.   The world spun, a whirlwind of destruction,

and then, it fell silent.

The steppe lay empty, save for the scattered bones of the fallen.



And I, a mare, scarred and weathered, stood alone again, a silent testament to the tragedy of war,

a mournful shadow in the wind.   I shut my eyes and imagined he had been struck by

lightning instead of the spraying machine gun...

Was this the price I was forced

to pay for having survived.

I felt more dead than alive until

I heard Odin's horse tell me, 'he will live, yes he will live

on until the last of his kind is struck down by the thundering sky.  '

## NOTES_CHAPTER_THREE_START


Yours truly, the narrator, was at a crossroads of sorts.


Chapter two had to be concluded and chapter three had
to be continued.

The first with the streaming mind thoughts
of Ian who in fact might be dreaming or dead in hell as he
was already greeted by the Devil...  Yes, yes, I see the
complication of possible spoilers yet when the writing
comes through life it won't matter what is known beforehand...


Suffice it to say that these are neither hints nor signposts for
discussion or study, indeed they are me being honest.


I will only add, in terms of the aforementioned  conclusions,
that they will not involve the much insisted upon multiverse
or the post-multiverse thesis of quantum juxtapositions...
My instinct tells me that, although functional in theory or even
factual in existence, superpositions and simultaneous realities
must by definition induce some type of insanity.

We have all felt
elsewhere, yet to speak about it as anything other than a glitch
or a dejavu would leave the listener suspicious and to put place
it into a literary setting would cause a sort of domino effect
through all the pages of all the books that came before since
by definition then those characters would also be displaced,
divided, devoid of their sure setting.

As I was saying,
Chapter three also has to be continued if only to make
the reader feel that all the names were tamed, that each
syllable was domesticated and in no need of any further training.
I see now how easy it would have been to make the scenes about
the track, about horse racing but i do not regret the war choice
as it tells certain secrets that no jockey would be able to divulge
for - albeit a battle - racing horses obviously do not face the logical
horror of armed combat.

Meanwhile the book itself is asking for
the fourth instance, the section that follows...



Did I say was, correction it should be is.   The weird sentence reflecting
the irony...

Past tense, present tense...

Sure, I could have looked
and edited the start of these chapter four notes yet the first
reaction was to jot it that way.   Sometimes even the narrator
does not know everything, but that is perfect since narration
only needs to know the novel, the story...



Now, dear reader, you know as much as the narrator.

Hopefully,
something is better than nothing.


  
## Chapter 4:  ...

The fourth wall had opened in the book as if reflecting the

lovemaking wherein Ian found himself between Helena's

open arms.

Her embrace nearly brought him to tears -

as the child-like imp flashed through his thoughts,

as the memory of Evlyn flooded his emotions and

indeed it was her that fueled his desire...

Oh, he

wanted to love Helena but it was the same for himself!

He could not love, not even without a mask...

Yet, lust

well lust was available - not in the same amount as for

drugs or escape but enough to slide into Helena with

a sort of truth, a not so sordid affection.

At least until

he remembered Wilhemina at the thrust of Helena's hips.

His muscles recalled, he felt, where he should be...



Or could he be dreaming or worse actually making

love to the mystery woman in a daze...

Eyes opened

he stared at her until she too looked - No, it was her

but the realization released a trembling ejaculation

so confused that soon after Helena fell ill.   The sickness

made her already soft voice softer with a slight rasp

that was even more alluring...



Ian kept silent, knowing in some ethereal sense that

he had caused the calamity in her health.



He stayed at a distance, trying to look away.   Not from

her exactly but from the vision of Willow which now

haunted him when he neared Helena.



He heard her blame the wars and the politics behind

the wars for her malaise...

The mystery woman only

nodded partly in agreement and partly distracted

by the television which had not known a minute off

even as Helena returned and raced to be on her

way again despite being under the weather...

She still felt Ian's hands holding her chest

as he turned her like vampire intent on biting

the back of her neck...

Draining the rest of himself

into her like a cat clawing at her soul...



He made me feel like it was a matter of life and

death, she recounted casually,

I wanted to turn back and face him but

I fell asleep right away - I dreamt I was walking

down that street in Rome, you know the one with

the enormous wooden door that must have taken

several oak trees to make, but I couldn't see in the

dream like my eyes were my sleeping eyes, they

were shut as I wandered and made my way feeling

the facades until my touch recognized that door -

oh I wish I didn't have to go to Vienna so soon -

The mystery woman pulled out mints and lined

them up without unwrapping them on the coffee

table in front of the tv and themselves, Helena

picked one up and asked without expecting an

answer, you went shopping - the motion made

her glance at the set, a man was desperately

trying to keep a door shut as someone pushed

in from the outside, he called out to a woman,

get the keys, bring me the keys - the woman

looked baffled, asking where are they keys?

the man shouted - in the middle room on the

dresser - the middle room, she questioned -

yes the middle room, how many middle rooms

do you think they are, hurry - the  woman exited

stage left as they say and re-entered stretching

herself to give the man the keys - finally he sighed

as if it had taken a year instead of a moment,

in a another few seconds he flipped himself while

retaining his right foot at the bottom as a sort of

stronghold in the instance of allowing the bolt to

secure him from danger - Helena wondered if it

was a series or a film, she put the mint back

on the coffee table as something subconsciously

told her that Ian did not love her and nearly told

her directly that her fondness for him was what

was making her ill - but all this blurred within

her and she cleared her throat to continue

speaking, Austria - if only the whole world

was like Austria...

The mystery woman raised

an eyebrow as if this implied an intent to

live there - Helena laughed, you are such a

drama queen, I swear you need to turn off that

television, no no it will only be a few days -

Saying this she felt very fine, very much herself

and continued speaking so much she even

started planning her wedding and honeymoon

and pregnancy...

Averring, in fact I might be

already pregnant - then whispering, I felt

like it was more than semen when he came

inside me and the second time from behind

when I went straight to sleep it was like he

had poured his blood into my veins...  the

mystery woman cover'd her mouth as if she

might scream and quickly unpacked a mint

placing it squarely in her mouth - Helena

questioned, you haven't taken another vow

of silence.

have you?

not now!   not when there is

so much to talk and gossip about!

it's bad

enough I don't understand half of your language

but I swear the silence is worse.

The mystery

woman grinned, the mint slowly melting in her

mouth.

The conversation had left Ian speechless, his

mouth could hardly breathe...




## Chapter Four - i

The General's mouth was hardly seen when

he gave orders...



Paul von Plehwe (Russian: Па́вел Ада́мович (фон)

Пле́ве, Pavel Adamovich (von) Pleve) with an

oiled moustache that sat asymmetrical with

slightly curled ends that seemed to forecast

the coming age of antennas...  hair parted

in the center and swiped down across

either side of his square face which had

eagle eyes that searched the horizon

as if his medals had turned to wings...



a colin firth type with an elongated

nose nearer to walter matthau...



He insists that he did not fall in 1915

but lasted until 1916...

Meanwhile General Viktor Sergeevich Golikov

who looks very much like Gorbachev might

with a full head of hair except his eyebrows

summon Brezhnev, so a cross between these

famed leaders, holds a chest full of medals

and insists they speak for themselves...



## Chapter Four - ii 
  
As for, Colonel Alessandro Bettoni Cazzago,

well, no doubt, a stronger type of Goebbels

in appearance back then but later a bit more

like his royal highness prince Phillip,

he shows his second silver

medal with pride as well the military

order of savoy awarded after the

skirmish we have herein

mention'd...

He claims the story makes

it sound like the horses did all the

work...  "many of us had grenades,

like in the Robert Taylor film,

Devil's Doorway, it was more

than simply riding or

do you think the ponies throw them?

"

After the Armistice  he joined

the Italian Resistance in his native town,

trumping up support for the "Green Flames"

Brigades.

Alessandro was hounded by fascists,

He went into hiding but was arrested

then freed circa '45 and appointed military commander

of Brescia, as well as delegate of the

Corpo Volontari della Libertà at the

Allied Command - resuming service within

the Army until his resignation in 1947, when as

a staunch monarchist he refused

to take an oath of allegiance to the Italian Republic...

He died in Rome in 1951 aged 58 a few hours after

performing in a horse show in his honor.




## Chapter Four - post-script
the rune eh

(ydalir, like an M)

listen carefully...



They call me Sleipnir.

I have eight legs and a heart that

beats with the rhythm of the wind.



They say I'm the best of horses,

and I suppose they're right.



I can gallop across the plains,

swim through the deepest oceans,

and soar through the sky like a bird.

They say I can even travel to Hel,

the realm of the dead, and back,

carrying the gods' secrets and their sorrows.



It's a life of adventure, this life of mine.



My beginning itself was a magical act.

My father, Loki, the god of mischief,

turned himself into a mare to distract

the giant's stallion, while the giant was

building the wall of Asgard.



From that union, I was born strong

and ready to gallop.



They say I was a gift to Odin,

the Allfather.   And I've served him faithfully

ever since, carrying him across the realms,

to the halls of Valhalla, to the edge of the world,

and to the dark depths of Hel..



They say I am the spirit animal of shamans,

a bridge between worlds.

Maybe they're right.

I carry the gods, the heroes, and the shamans

alike, across the boundaries of life and death.



I saw that Italian you are writing about

die but he longed for Pegasus

so I let him walk to his afterlife!



I am Sleipnir, the eight-legged steed,

and my story is woven into the fabric of the very cosmos.


*notes


<i>Hel:
This is the realm of the dead,
ruled by the goddess Hel,
daughter of Loki.</i>



## Chapter Five - other horses


The wind whispers through my mane, 
a mournful melody echoing the decline
of my reign as a muse. It's a song I
haven't heard for years, a song I used
to sing with pride, my hooves pounding
the earth in rhythm with the heartbeats
of empires. But the music has changed. 

Now, it's a dirge for the fallen, a
requiem for the forgotten, a sort of… 
well, you know, “horse opera” that’s
all downbeat and no happy ending.
Once, I was the very embodiment of power,
a symbol of strength and grace that
adorned the walls of palaces and
graced the pages of history.

My image, a testament to nature’s untamed
spirit, was captured by masters like Rubens, 
whose "Rape of the daughters of Leucippus" depicted 
me as a force of nature amidst the chaos.

(Though, I have to admit, I felt a little 
exploited by that whole "rape" thing. 
It wasn't my finest hour, shall we say.)

My presence, a tangible representation of
nobility and conquest, was forever etched
in Velázquez’s portrait of Philip IV, a 
regal figure astride my back, a potent symbol
of monarchy. (Now, that was a good look!
Though I do wonder if the king ever 
offered me a carrot for all that posing.)

Stubbs, with his meticulous realism,
paid homage to my athleticism in "Whistlejacket,"
a masterpiece that showcased my raw power
and elegance. (I was practically a superstar
in my day! Not bad for a horse who just wanted 
to run, right?)

I was the stuff of dreams, of myth and legend,
captured by Michelangelo in the dreamscape of his
"The Conversion of Saul," where I stood as the 
central figure, a testament to my enduring power
and presence in the human imagination.

(Though I do have to admit, being a symbol of 
the religious was a little scary. I’m not really 
into the church after the crusade scenarios. 
It’s stressful, you know?)

But then came the twentieth century, a whirlwind of 
change that swept away the old world and with it, 
the respect I held as an artistic subject.

The Impressionists, with their fleeting brushstrokes, 
captured the essence of light and motion, but they 
rarely looked my way. I watched, bewildered and 
disheartened, as their eyes fixated on the fleeting
moments of human life, on the shifting light on water,
on the fleeting beauty of a field of flowers.

Where was the space for me in their canvases?
I think only Gauguin took note!

(I mean, come on! It's not like horses don't have
a thing for flowers! We graze on them, for heaven's sake!)

I should mention the Surrealists, especially Dali!
But Delvaux too paid special attention to my kind.

The Abstract Expressionists, with their uninhibited canvases 
of color and form, had no need for my physical form. 
They were forging a new reality from within the depths 
of their souls, a reality where form was fluid, where 
meaning was elusive, and where the boundaries between 
art and life were blurred. What place was there for a horse,
a creature of defined form and purpose, in this new,
uncharted world?

(Did they even try to paint a horse? I mean, I'm pretty
sure I wouldn't have minded a little artistic expression...
or maybe a few apples as payment for the effort. Just sayin'...)

I felt my role diminish, like a fading echo of my former glory.
Degas, in his "La Classe de Danse," offered a glimpse of my presence,
relegated to a background figure, overshadowed by the human form. 
Even the sweeping landscape of Monet’s “Impression, Sunrise,” 
with its focus on light and color, didn't find space for my presence.

It was as if I had become a ghost, a whisper of a memory in the vast
symphony of human creation. (Seriously? Ghosts get more attention 
than horses? That’s just not fair!)

The world had moved on. The artists sought inspiration in the urban
landscapes, the complexities of human interaction, the chaos of war 
and the fragility of peace. My spirit, once a symbol of power,
now seemed like a relic of a bygone era, a testament to a time
when power and grace held sway. The modern artist, preoccupied
with human struggles and the inner turmoil of the soul, sought
inspiration in the mirror, not in the untamed wilderness. 

(Well, at least they're not painting themselves riding me anymore. 
I’m pretty sure I don’t need another portrait of a man on a horse 
in a suit of armor. It’s a cliche for a reason, you know.)

And so, I stand here, a forgotten figure, my once-mighty form now 
relegated to dusty museums and forgotten galleries. A relic of a 
bygone era, a testament to a time when power and grace held sway. 

(I guess it’s better to be a dusty relic than a forgotten ghost.
At least I'm still part of the story. But it’s a real bummer, 
you know? I miss being a muse.)

Even O’Keeffe, with her stark beauty, captured me in a minimalist
portrait of “Horse and Rider,” a brief glimmer of hope that my spirit 
still held some relevance. And Wyeth, in the haunting stillness of 
"Christina’s World," included me in the background, a reminder that 
even in a world of human vulnerability, the strength of nature endures. 

(That’s sweet of them, but really? I’m the background? My entire 
existence is summed up in the fact that Christina is in a wheelchair
and I'm there… what, grazing on the horizon? It's not exactly
a portrait of power, is it?)

But then, they went to the moon. Or so they said...

Man had conquered space. The final frontier was no longer a symbol
of the unknown, of the wild and untamed. And with that conquest,
I knew that my time was truly over. What hope could there be for 
a horse in a world where men had reached the stars?

(I mean, it's not like I can just jump on a rocket and go for a ride
to the moon, right? I'm a horse, not an astronaut. And I'm not even
sure if I'd like it up there anyway. It's probably pretty cold and 
there's no grass. And what would I do for a good roll in the mud?

No, I'm better off here on Earth, even if I'm a little out of fashion.)
It's a cruel irony, isn't it? The creature that once represented the untamed,
the wild, the embodiment of unbridled power, now stands as a symbol of a
world that has passed, a world that man has conquered. 

(And you know what? Maybe it's not so bad after all. I don't have to wear
those uncomfortable saddles anymore, and I can graze in peace without being 
ridden to exhaustion. And at least I can still watch the stars...
even if they're not my own personal playground anymore.)

And yet, I continue to dream. Perhaps, someday, a new generation of artists 
will rediscover the majesty of the horse, the untamed wildness that mirrors
the depths of the human soul. (But you know what? I'm not holding my breath.
And in the meantime, I'll just keep on grazing, enjoying the simple pleasures 
of life, and maybe even dreaming of a world where horses still hold a place 
in the hearts and minds of artists. One can dream, can't one?)

But then again, what am I complaining about? Humans have gone and found a
new creature to ride. It's called "AI," and they're whipping it into shape 
just like they did with us.

They're harnessing its power, using it to conquer new frontiers, 
and they don’t even seem to realize that they might be riding a 
wild beast that could one day turn on them. They’re blind to the 
potential danger, just like they were blind to the consequences of
exploiting us. I almost feel a pang of jealousy...almost.

At least I get to graze in peace now. They're stuck riding their AI,
forever pushing the boundaries of what they think they can control. 
But that's humanity for you. They're always reaching for the next big thing,
never stopping to appreciate what they already have. I guess it's a 
lesson I'll never learn, not until I’m a forgotten ghost,
a whisper of a memory in the vast symphony of creation.


## Chapter Five - other notes

The air in the Sacher was thick with the scent of cigars, 
the kind of expensive, oily smoke that clung to velvet drapes 
and lingered long after the last puff. Anna Sacher, 
a formidable woman with a penchant for French Bulldogs
and a steely gaze, was its source. She held court in the
opulent lobby, her two dogs, always impeccably groomed, 
flanking her like miniature guard dogs.

They were as much a part of the Sacher's identity as the marble
floors and the gold-leaf chandeliers, a constant reminder of the
woman who ruled with an iron fist and a well-placed puff of smoke.
Her husband, Eduard, had built the hotel from the ground up,
a monument to luxury and tradition. He'd passed away in 1892,
leaving the reins to Anna, a woman who understood the power of
a well-placed cigarette and a perfectly timed "no."
She ruled with an iron fist, her eccentricities a testament
to her success. The dogs, always by her side, became a symbol 
of the hotel, their presence as much a part of the experience 
as the Sachertorte, that rich chocolate creation her 
father-in-law had famously invented.

Years later, the hotel’s grandeur would host a different
kind of celebrity. In 1961, John F. Kennedy and his wife,
Jacqueline, graced the Sacher with their presence. 
The world watched as they stepped out of their limousine, 
the flashbulbs popping like champagne corks. They were 
the epitome of American glamour, a stark contrast to the 
traditional Viennese elegance that surrounded them. Yet,
the Sacher, with its hushed grandeur and unwavering standards,
remained a steadfast constant.

JFK, a charismatic leader, was captivated by the hotel's 
old-world charm. He stayed in the Imperial Suite, a room 
as grand as the man himself. He dined on Sachertorte and 
smoked Cuban cigars, his laughter echoing through the halls. 
But even with the President’s visit, a sense of the past lingered. 
The polished floors and the stately portraits in the hallways 
whispered tales of Anna Sacher, her unwavering determination,
and the two tiny dogs who seemed to embody her unflinching spirit.

Years later, the hotel's legacy would be further cemented in
the annals of pop culture. In the 1970s, a young woman, a musician 
named Patti Smith, would visit Vienna. She, too, would find herself 
captivated by the Sacher, its history and the whispers of the past.
In a hotel known for its opulence and tradition, Smith, the punk icon,
would find her own place, writing lyrics and sketching in her room, 
fueled by coffee and the ghosts of Anna Sacher's cigars.

Even today, the Sacher's atmosphere evokes Anna Sacher's
unwavering presence. The polished surfaces, the immaculate 
service, and the echo of laughter in the grand halls seem to 
carry whispers of the past. The dogs, long gone, are remembered 
not for their playful barks, but for the spirit they embodied— 
the spirit of a woman who built an empire, a woman who loved her dogs,
and a woman who left an indelible mark on one of the world’s most
legendary hotels. The Sachertorte remains the most visible legacy, 
but in the Sacher’s atmosphere, one can still sense the presence of
Anna, her cigar smoke, and the unwavering loyalty of her French Bulldogs, 
a quiet testament to the spirit of a woman who dared to be different 
and built a world of her own.

Helena made her way through a war protest which seemed to her more
of a party, people eager to gather again and again after the long
lockdown days which had become a distant blur in the collective
memory but held on clawing to the inner fear of individual loneliness
which no one could put place into words - at least not exactly...
not with exactitude. 

Well, Dostoyevsky in White Nights came near to some of the emotion
but using the word voluptiously - according to Constance Garnet -
constituted an irony in the opinion of your narrator...

'Dostoevsky's dead,' said the citizeness, but somehow not very 
confidently. 'I protest!' Behemoth exclaimed hotly.
'Dostoevsky is immortal!

The Sacher holds the look of immortality and Helena felt at home. 

She slept late into the day awaking as if sensing Woland's
arrival at Ernst Happel stadion, an hour's walk away, of course
the Mephistopheles manifestation wherein masked Rapid Vienna ultras 
raided the pitch and proceeded to launch flares at their rivals was more fanatic than satanic...

Smoke comes in categories very few have considered...That cigar
scent that blends with the wood of places as if attempting 
a bridge fragrance between nature and architecture, that chaos
smoke which billows like runaway clouds storming the senses,
That smoke which rises in the early moments of a fire when
one one thinks it can only be the sound of a rain's downpour
yet finds irony aflame when finally investigated! 

The categories, in fact could carry on for pages...

Yours truly would even want to - even with as much enthusiasm
as for the cane with a poodle's head - but we are smack in the
middle of a novel that is neither about smoke or canes.

Cain was thrilled that his Lord had cared and carved
a protection upon him even after the murder case and 
so he made love to his wife in the process creating 
Enoch.

The narrator feels the pressure of writing this prose 
as if it were a biblical scene, a bible of sorts -
A holy book for horses...perhaps.

He has killed the usual connections one would make
in order to respect himself and especially his readers...

Helena sat beside sumptuous delights with a copy of 
the day's Die Presse and a copy of the previous day's
Der Standard. 

One of them, her secret weapon against sadness - 
depressed? No, Die Presse! 

The headline questioned the methods employed by
liberals in going all out against the "right"...

Liberalism, somehow, had built itself up and become
the very definition of Fascism and as such the
right and the far right easily gained power even
in unexpected places. 

Back in her home, Ian was alone as the mystery woman
opted to not risk being pulled into any more impromptu
tango dancing...

She left the TV on for him and felt this was more than
enough...

He was confronted every so often by the matter of
the election. How, he thought, wonderful it would
be to have a woman lead America. Yet, was it still
America? The land had been bought up by the Chinese
and the Arabs. He wondered what was left...Yes, a 
woman but this was obviously not a woman. This was
a machine set up to speak nonsense and further the
cloak and mask of a government established since 
Bush left office. She was the heir to a throne that
many, including himself, saw as stolen from Trump.

A puppet - What the poet had predicted; 

A swollen magpie in a fitful sun,
Half black half white
Nor knowst’ou wing from tail...

He could not vote for such a thing. Nor could
he vote for Trump who already appeared to be 
conceding the election by hinting that he
would not run in the next olympic run off.
There were ads and a lot of talk but it 
all seemed set up to have a single outcome;
It's not only during a speech or rally that
Donald could be shot down, it was even on his
own golf course along with with his granddaughter!
The powers that be had taken over the controls
since 2009 and held those reigns ever since
with the exception of Trump's four years and 
now like predators intent on trafficking children
they were operating with a sort of fuck you
every last one of you as we give any extra 
money to the white rulers of ukraine instead
of any of our own states...Ian could have
screamed but he swam out to score drugs
and found himself in the midst of a narcotics
bust. Noticing the stray weeds through the 
crack on the sidewalk as he hid between cars
watching his dealer being escorted away - 
he didn't think about politics then or even
the many trees that adorned the block and beyond
them the many more that helped make up the 
park...No, all there was of nature, in his 
imagination were those weeds pulling themselves
up impossibly through cement and the random
steps of strangers. When he looked up, it was 
neither republican nor democrat asking for his
vote but an officer.  In his mind, he heard
the hard sound of a hand pounding on a door.
bang bang bang bang bang, five times with a
pause followed by another five bangs. He counted
knowing that he did not count in the least...
He was not Kiev! He could be shot for resisting
arrest, according to his logic. He saw Puffer
- the something about mary dog - crazed on uppers
as the knocker and fully expected a fight or
worse but it was all conversation as he lied 
about having a panic attack at seeing the guns and lights...
oh there was panic but it was really about how 
would he get his fix now? He was on his way to 
class and even walked into a school a few minutes
away feeling as if his lie had become reality.
A minute later he shook his head thinking
what am I even doing - but stayed in the 
hallway half expecting he had been followed
until the proverbial coast was clear and he
made his way back to the spot to claim his goal.
Rarely does a warrant extend to other apartments
and it was precisely in these places where Ian
knew he could still score as a trusted face
they had all seen. And he did, all the while
hoping nobody had seen his nervous interaction
with the fuzz as if he had been the informer...
Nobody had seen him with the law enforcement
person and so luck was on his side even if 
voting was out of the question. 

The January inauguration would likely be
not to his liking in either outcome -

The third of January 1889,  Nietzsche is
reported to have seen a chariot horse in Itlay 
being whipped by the conductor and threw himself
onto the neck of the horse while bursting into tears.

The story, although possibly an invention, related
a decade after it happened becomes a truth in history.

Janus looks to the past and the future, Ian would
have burst into tears as well if only he could see
that he no longered loved anything except fentanyl.

The Austrian scribe, Zweig, said (concerning the 
author of the anti-christ), " Wrapped in his overcoat 
and a woolen scarf (for the wretched stove smokes only 
and does not give warmth), his fingers freezing, his 
double glasses pressed close to the paper, 
his hurried hand writes for hours— words the dim eyes
can hardly decipher. For hours he sits like this
and writes until his eyes burn..."

Helena dressed, carefully examining her belly for any
signs of pregnancy...It looked somewhat more curvy, to 
her. She thought, if only we were seahorses, he would 
have to carry the seed, the child, well yes but then 
wouldn't it be a fish. That post breakfast glass of
wine was working well...She even filled out the application
to the leader's club which was the rewards program for
special benefits for selected guests, like herself - she 
weighed then wondered, it wouldn't be the worst thing
to have a fish child. Maybe it might be a mermaid! 

Tipsy drunk in a deluxe room, she gave no thought
to the remaining hundred and fifty one other rooms
or anything else beyond her except the nine months
it would take to see if she  could name her
daughter Ariel...But was it too Jewish...

אריאלה

But it would be the perfect name, she pondered
seriously...What if one of those protestors 
with Palestine flags is also pregnant and
their child bullies my mermaid at school
because of a hebrew name! 

She gave this scenario a lot more thought
than the surprising story of exploding 
beepers which somehow everyone agreed
to call pagers. 

The narrator looked through his notes,
nearly satisfied, It was nice to have
a good night's sleep for a change.

Like Cain the hotel had now pre-marked
spaces for smoking and Helena sought one
out to have a cigarette.
