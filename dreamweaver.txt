       <p><b>
         23 october 2024 oh to redeploy this on a smurf anniversary. i think i should have waited until the 30th,
		
		ezra pound day, or even november...yet there is a lot on my mind and writing is what i do...
		
		pelevin does not write in fact he puzzles over a position, sometimes in brilliant fashion,
		
		until drowning it with a sort of too much information for his readers to process...in my
		
		experience the nearest example for contrast would be phillip k dick...

		the writer had recently completed notes for a novel and was told pdk shopped
		
		at happy dog for horse meat when he was struggling to survive hence horselover fat...

		that is to say it is the type of style one encounters in valis except amped up as if
		
		the loudness allowed more freedom of speech i suppose...

		subsequently i read the horse stealers by anton chekhov...

		let's see before i delve deeper...i have decided to not include the preceeding notes,
		
		themselves possibly a book or two, these should stand on their own and if any reader
		
		would like them well i would not refuse a request to package them up and send them 
		through...

		my point is that writing freely should not be mistaken with writing for free, life
		
		is not free and even awful writing is paid...case in point, colleen hoover...

		or do women usually follow men into new york city restrooms after the author
		
		picks at bulgokov's entrance...

		ahem. i never realized how good lecarre was until reading his first novel which
		
		was perfection save for the jewess's confession and the ending list in any case
		
		miles above the film version which kept the wife as self-described nymphomaniac
		
		slut in a redundant twist that must've made john's head spin...

		yes i know too much prelude for dream notes and so here goes; 

		hurricane milton followed helene and i was haunted by the control weather brim skit 
		
		as many others thought the democrats were trying to smash the hard core red state
		
		voters to gain those delegates, those delicate votes...

		one ukrainian and his family got swallowed in florida after escaping the so-called
		
		war...the appointment in samara fleshed out with full irony...

		within my own contradictions i dreamt of a topless cousin and eating cake -
		
		later seeing her arrive with other girls...hadnt thought of her much since
		
		she never invited me to her wedding and later that evening i had a clear vision
		
		of her bed...excuse me i am not looking for parking, in fact i don't have a vehicle...

		the man mom married passed away on the same day as jack kerouac had, which was about the
		
		time she moved to the states over the hills and far away...

		something kept trying to connect me with him and i even felt it scan memory as if
		
		to say aha or even make it my demise...i was starting to even feel dizzy sick until
		
		james cagney directed shortcut to hell...

		i'm with zelda in france at some art class and it feels as natural as being
		
		with joan in england pub except one of them was taking my picture and i had not
		
		shaved and tried to hide my stubble as it were...

		floating in my apartment as if visiting myself - the cat is on one of the beds -

		finding myself in a car being kissed by ava and her triangle tongue, later
		speaking with zofia...

		a man was handing me a great variety of two dollar bills, i watched flightplan
		
		again and catchfire, how does one forget nudity - perhaps when the talent
		
		is so overwhelming that what remains is the method not the madness -

		loro was a real revelation and i had no answer to my own question, if you liked
		
		youth so much why not seek out other films by that director...

		the family friend was no let down, even thrilling once in a while -

		meanwhile the box of things minus the requested samsonite case i asked for
		
		which was sent out in june finally arrived in october...

		i was much more satisfied by the substance, i keep looking back at it amazed
		
		at its form...

		reminded after of the girl i walk'd some with - down riverside drive...

		dress as if meant to be recalled...packing suitcase as marlon talks -

		i think he was recording to tape also...talk of order, standing in line

		french fries conspiracy - a finger at my lip - what does the sticker say?

		two million dollars carrying a girl inside a movie theatre - someone is tracking

		us - i think of laura sophia instead of lotta, fresh air - i'm standing at the 

		entrance of a mansion, in fact i think i only dreamt of lotta once...in any

		case i recite the phone number that pre-dates me and is yet active -

		there are two women one undressed and bleeding it seems like menstruation

		unfiltered and left without washing but it is all so fast i cannot focus

		and awake like when walking on aluminum foil landscape - was it bird or insect

		at window suddenly mixed by chirp or crawling sound within me...not sure

		yet i was trying to escape...i cannot escape my lost apartment, there i 

		am with mother painting the hall i am going to my room convinced that my

		date is not coming, but the girl arrives wearing a pleated skirt which she

		raises in front of me as if to make me get up...there is an indian statue 

		with the word nadie or nadia and i like it deciding to put place it on

		my dresser...it wears a dark shawl, i start thinking they also did not 

		send my japanese cat statue...so when did i actually start to weep? well,

		during dominique when the boy dies protecting the girl oksana left in 

		a chained padlock light switch room...not that i'm the action packed type

		but someone called asking for leidsa numbers i think i said 34, 76,

		and 91...nobody called in terms of condolences. 
		
		(one call from an aunt followed this typing,

		which inspired me to invent a man who had

		a toaster for an ass which needed to be plugged in)
		
		alina sent nude pictures. (possible email scam

		but as a gentleman i try to reply pleasantly)

		i only cry in the movies and even if i spend the day smoking i never light
		
		up a cigarette in dreams...
		<br>
		<br>

		0ctober 24...dreams like visitations - well, visions to be precise...
		
		i had received a phone call, a nearly unusual event these days...

		so there was more talk than what has become ordinary - i suppose that

		along with texting went a ways into overwhelming my senses - 

		i went to sleep at the second hour after midnight thinking of

		book titles and elvis costello - one of us is lying...i get what

		feels like a locked car in the sun temperature or perhaps a sun

		soaked roof feeling and get up to let in fresh air and pour

		water on myself...when i finally get to sleep i dream that i am

		naked on my bed and someone starts speaking...i cover myself and

		feel cool enough not to wonder or worry since it is a know face -

		still, there is something about it upon reflection that is disturbing;

		this all becomes some sort of party, i wonder how long it takes

		to fly from warsaw to tel aviv but alexandra is actually flying to

		new york - there is now a group of people mainly girls - one of them

		remninds me of helena's jeans under a tied christian dior shirt

		she pulled on like you would a t-shirt...buttons must feel she does

		not like them enough to unbutton and so forth...well in the dream 

		it is not her, someone more spanish although possibly not spain -

		lotta hinted that she had a greatly good time in mallorca yet i 

		have not witnessed the recording myself...in the dream i feel

		drained while the woman in those specific jeans looks to be in 

		an orgasmic convulsion as if possessed like a spirit is making 

		love her or at least nibble kissing her neck yet no one is near

		and worse everyone acts as if nothing is going down...i must have 

		got up at some point and am standing in the crowd studying her -

		she has another fit in the epilepsy style except this time she

		is intent on reaching the source of her frantic excitement - 

		as she exits i see two men on a bed, there is a tv on and a

		laptop also on next it...i say something about turning at least

		one of them off and they don't disagree...i awake right after

		to find that i only slept a couple of hours...i jot the basics

		of the scenes, fill the bath with water and ivory and hope

		i can catch some more minutes of sleep and or dreams that make

		more sense before i slip into coffee and internet and such...

		thursday is rising fast and my only plan is to go through my

		scales especially the two new ones i keep mixing up - not certain

		why arabic translates in thought as if enigmatic and vice versa...

		(my ritual is now at eighteen scales, one of them

		my own hybrid creation...)

		ps. did more sleep did sleep more yet maybe too much...seen mallorca

		except she seemed more content in the paradoxe...i recalled another

		scene wherein some child dislodged a lens from my frames...i pick

		it up to see if it can be returned to place but it is shattered

		and much larger...dolce gabanna it actually happened in the city

		without a kid just a sliver missing, glasses i still wear...well,

		outside as for some reason i took to not wearing eyewear at home -

		meanwhile london and i never understood how sarcastic daniel's

		face could be but i mean that in a goodly way...expression, some

		faces need no words to communicate...lotta communicates eye patches

		in stories yet her puffy morning eyes are when i think she looks

		exquisitely beautiful...but now i know prada preceeded the perfume

		in dusseldorf...alison james wrote wilhemina tempest's obituary -

		 “We are such stuff as dreams are made on, and our little life is 
		
		rounded with a sleep.”

		i have inclinations to continue to employ the pen at ASDBL and

		even the alaska experiment yet it is not pressing, it is like

		ideas or notions i wonder if i should augment with...obviously

		wilhemina bring this to mind as i'm not sure if i made it clear

		enough that she branches out from the source muse character to

		another yes that and the fact that i think it might be good

		to list all the types of horses perhaps in a glossary as

		burroughs did with drugs...there is actually a buzz as if

		i am getting high on my own writing...

		 “You taught me language, and my profit on’t is,
		
		I know how to curse.”

		25 october -

		friday the funeral I did not attend or intend to go to...

		in speaking to the widow about my reasons, the point arose

		in mind's irony...well i had a dream that i was standing

		in a funeral ceremony viewing myself in the coffin...

		i said it was about the age of twelve but most likely it

		was later as it impressed me so that it was among the 

		first attempts at literature...the dream is true however

		the fear of it is not...i stayed up much later than 

		i wanted, getting up several times to make soup and 

		and to make coffee and even again to seduce the hunger

		into submission with a slice of bread...there was an 

		emptiness i could not explain...let us call it an invasion -

		a mystical raid that later even extended into language as a

		foreign song tried to spin around my head...

		it was late morning by the time i got to sleep, the hours

		herein reflect a european time zone - 

		early evening awoke from dreams that found me in a 

		modern building - the office type - i am trying to

		get a pair of shoes fixed and i am told by a woman

		where i could get that done...as i approach the elevator

		it shuts and slides down yet i hear someone say they

		will bring it back which nearly instantly they do as

		i then find myself holding a pair of adidas...it is

		an elevator operator like in a recent instyle story

		reel which lucy was in...i suppose it came to mind

		and there i am with her but it is like a pastry shop

		where i lose sight of her and start unwrapping and

		tasting and returning the sweets to their place wrapped, 
		
		as the voice of some other women recommends, i like the taste

		or perhaps i have not satisfied the weird hunger...

		i think to get some for the widow and the dream ends.

		i had viewed a japanese film, kubi, which is said to be

		about events in 1582...although crowded with bloody

		scenes and even a careless view of homosexuality or 

		if you prefer a degrading view of women
		
		(which should prove shocking enough to most),it still did not

		have that centerpiece alike hellboy the crooked man

		wherein the snake exits the girl's down there parts

		and slithers up into her mouth...the most striking 

		moment was the "delicious" poisoned snapper irony. 

		if only they could have bought dean martin's ain't

		that a kick in the head for the final credits.


		<br>
		<br>
                12 november...was it lennon, life is waht happens

		when you are busy making other plans...i did not

		intend to have to wait so long for a dream that

		made sense enough to put place into words...

		although i know the experience as commonplace to

		myself when under the influence of weed wherein

		dreams are so light they carry no weight in memory...

		meanwhile i kept cleaning house...i view'd several

		many more films, most recently thunderball, man woman 

		or teen was that tom jones belting out the theme...

		sean sucking claudine's foot...she was in a genius 

		bikini...in the dream it was evening and within that

		night the rain poured down in storm-fashion...the times

		wroted 'trump storms back' as if it wasnt enough to 

		have stuck their neck out on the silly endorsement they

		seemed to go with a cheap daniels jape...

		i remember i went shopping for a fan - thinking it sort

		of proved that 2020 was replete, filled with fraud...

		people, in the dream scene were running, crowds of them, 

		through the shadow of trees above where i walked which

		was a roadway, a woman was with me as we decided to hail 

		a taxi, japanese contraption spied letting out a customer

		and i got in as the girl vanished - a very little man 

		drove but on the side as one might find in those sidekick

		motorcycle - another man without pickles kept nearing 

		from the front i faced as if searching me for something -

		i searched through sofia's first well second failed film

		which is called priscilla, first girl i ever kissed in 

		some childhood lobby uptown, it starts ramones perfect

		directer by spector but i felt the cast did not resemble

		the reality, even graceland looked like an apartment not

		a mansion, vegas scene was nice, the hinted los angeles

		ending was cool yet like the book burning it didnt capture

		the impact...no elvis songs in the soundtrack sure was

		shocking...yes i know easy to monday morning quarterback
		
		pick apart and yes obviously a great amount of effort

		went into it...hopefully she will get back to form in 

		her next scenes...the driver did not want to go to 

		bella vista and i had to agree to be let out as near

		to my destination as he could manage...i awoke before

		getting anywhere, gabby got published with nowhere, usa

		and i was very happy for her without agreeing that the

		midwest is hell...or even frozen although i know poetic 

		language is what language cannot be...robert graves,

		the white goddess, a reading that makes me feel the 

		limit of my own recall. thousands of stories and 

		connections which are impossible to memorize...

		embraced it awake and held it asleep...one understands

		some of the major points, the intent, let us call it

		the premise...in itself a duality that aims to prove and

		provoke yet in the build up of facts and circumstantial

		evidence there is a dizzy sort of who or what question

		as the whirlwind spins into a series of explorations...

		i agree somewhat - not with the style - but with the 

		concept and feel especially thrilled that there is 

		no pop quiz at the end of this bizarre masterpiece. 

		the jews agree; the body should be buried...the outrun,

		say or see never looked so beautiful yet how could such

		an intelligent character be so dumb? well, drinking 

		does kill brain cells, they say...did love the ending. 

		these are not movie recommendations, merely notes for

		i know not what exactly except by definition as a writer 

		i scribble into the constant illusion of now...

		the past presents itself in emilee form again the run,

		in the book he mentions witches running around a place 

		nine times to cast a spell or the mirror walk behind

		the cursed one so their prat fall results in the stumble -

		there's a little girl, so precious and pretty, i am sure

		it is an illusion but i explain that yes i am keeping

		my promise to the extent that no masked intruder could

		make a fool of me...for a minute i wanted to believe 

		michael was innocent but then i asked myself and even

		ai what other man ever asked to sleep with someone's

		child nevermind the box of porn under the bed...

		ah yes, ready or not - a real modern classic with

		spontanous combustion...dear me i liked that one alot,

		in some ways a sort of documentary i felt for myself

		as i sometimes believe my family has always been out

		to rub out or switch off my dream girl...maternal

		grandmother being the exception, i digress...not meaning

		to have such a word count here dear readers if i have

		any other dream to report you will find it here...

		please note - warner brothers/level is pulling the

		plug on two skinny girls...i could remove the 

		catalog now but why would i? so i am letting it happen

		so it will be on their heads not mine and re-uploading

		the songs after that point. hopefully there won't

		be much downtime but so you know it is not a glitch

		in the streaming services or outlets circa 18 november

		and beyond. 

		<br>
		<br>
		
                13 november dream fading upon waking possibly eva green
		
		or lotta stichler, the knit sweater taking longer than
		
		i expected, the idea of twin sister sure is interesting-
		
		not so interesting is the day's unusual diet dessert
		
		flan on top of leftover chinese and two almond cupcakes -
		
		it's like being drowsy drunk on food...fueled with never

		say never again where sean returns to bookend the remake

		i make thoughts on megapolis, as i revist the ending 

		of the white goddess wherein graves gives the devil his due

		as it were...my bath so cold i yelped -

		where was i oh yes this one is not easy, i hope it is

		like depalma scarface which i couldnt understand until a second viewing,

		but i boubt it as this seems to require the faith of an inner child

		yet it is precisely achild in the role of an assassin...

		elvis impersonator felt weird unless one thinks of his daughter -

		my fued with it can be in the sum of two points;

		that lead actress seemed to be pulled from the cast of show girls

		and dud did not transmit emotions required for empathy and

		morpheus stands around as if he had really been killed

		in the apocalypse now boat a walking zombie also doing voice 

		over keeping in mind that he can memorize shakespeare

		it must have been the easiest role he ever learnt

		but if vourse iyt is not a movie...it is a family affair

		 a warning and a prayer with deliverance arrows

		my firs thought was oh no not a happy ending

		sensed tears at the dedication to wife

		once he was going to forget everythint he had learned

		and write like he was a teen, perhaps that is what 

		we have seen...director's cut? classified

		wondering why aaron kept leaving the fire arms released

		along with the extended version of caligula well

		woman of the hour had something, that is how wrong 

		we can be in judging...anyway i was hoping for a 

		sort of youth without youth vibe but maybe next time -

		at least there was a real sense of new york city in

		the apprentice...pre-disney manhattan might have been

		the message in me gap ol is...ford to city drop...

		of course the issue with outstanding acting ie

		the critic is that one starts rooting for the villainous 

		character...irony will drown us all...

		i tear up the picture of the fat man of the week

		tv show interview the dearly departed had done 

		finding it alone in a scrap book never started -

		i play my scales over the film concentrating on

		the gypsy...now thinking that's what dylan called

		elvis staying in a big hotel smiling as he appreached

		saying well well...i try to take a nap but the nap

		takes me further into thinking with the national

		soundtrack of ymca village folk rising in nonsense

		echoing...young mens christian association...

		maybe it will help jerry lee's cousin jimmy...

		maybe i have overdosed on film...certainly

		on porn...some other position postultes 

		god in the volcano or zeus...some of it makes

		sense and it gives me pause...perhaps i have to

		revisit joseph campbell's ideas...tomorrow and

		tomorrow alexander the great is named pharaoh

		but that 332BC, not because but before it's fun

		to stay at the why have we not been there...

		<br>
		<br>

		14 november

		i'd felt outside my self all day as if waiting
		
		for the evening and the i'd felt the evening
		
		was not waiting for me...

		they say the berlin ruling system collapsed,
		
		they say dw union is on a two day strike...

		maybe i was locked in a teledisco booth -

		some of the monkeys were given fruit loops...

		in terms of entertainment, i should have mentioned

                finally catching up with the second parts of 

		ahs 12 as well as american horror stories. 

		emma, have i got a story for you concerning

		the ambulance birth...but i didn't get why

		wear the bitch's headgear?

		otherwise i liked the liminal spaces idea

		but i really have an insnae bias against

		blubbler so i could hardly enjoy the 

		last part of the stories which should have

		brought to mind asylum season, yeah i was

		more worried that the buttons of her blouse

		were going to fly off into the the other

		actress's face...

		pre dream pissing on lotta's face...

		walking through the chelsea hotel thinking

		of the brazilian girl i went there with

		willy deville singing to walk that girl home...

		minutes or moments later it's all pretty dark

		and i seem to be without a body hovering or

		hooked up with some woman on amsterdam avenue

		who is upset over the drug dealers that stand

		around in fron of the shop she's trying to 

		get into...i hear the vague outline of her

		voice arguing against them and they seem 

		to be replicas of each other even in the

		way they are dressed...i don't know where

		this dream went - i get up too early but

		take a minute or a moment for cigarettes

		coffee and this note...marian is on my 

		mind as i give skirt the party mix eats...

		there's a text message about a wallet and

		it nearly derails all the details of the

		dreaming but as i type i start to recall

		the strange door dreams, three k where

		i find cheese and nickel bags thinking 

		to snack and go back to my room and puff

		when it sounded like someone was at the

		entrance...other door dream opening but

		then it does not fit like three quarters

		of it only which left a slender opening...

		here door a motley gang of men insisting

		that i am having a soiree and wanting to

		come in and celebrate as i stand there

		baffled and nearly upset...i had lined

		the back door with litre glasses of 

		coca cola bottles, but it was the front

		door. people are strange when you're a

		stranger should have been played.

		seven in the morning sweden, one in the

		morning here, eleven in the evening los

		angeles. this ain't the mud club or cbgb's...

		early afternoon in asian towns, sounds like

		monkey genocide in thailand...valencia might

		re-flood with evacuations underway, i hope

		padam padam is a hit but there is no logical

		way to juggle time zones...

		23 november...so much has gone down and yet 

		not much has happened...arrival of guest and

		groovy haul - my habit was to always buy one

		nice shirt when possible but i find myself with

		five new shirts all at once...

		a weird luxury. some rich dreams too yet

		mostly disintegrating as the waking thoughts

		rattle me up to serve breakfast and start the

		day...a few weeks ago i was very happy that

		lucy  was going to film in rome, i think

		where fellini worked out his scenese, and 

		i sure did have a dream wherein we were very

		friendly as if rejoicing yet lotta  had

		gone to new york and mentioned a girl named

		giulia which then made me think it might have

		been her in the dream...not much time for

		sleep as i don't allow my guest to cook or

		clean...but this is no complaint or protest...

		i play the substance everyday, today will be

		the fifth time...in fact i am looking forward 

		to it...there's a week or so left of this 

		"visiting" and i will try to report on the

		proceedings as soon as possible...posed

		one of the "taken down" songs and it was 

		a spirit breaking experience...the cover was

		not accepted since they require very specific

		dimensions, so my lock and key artwork went

		by the wayside for some stock image...then

		the exported catalog is all in wav files but

		this requires mp3 or flac...it was for -low fi-

		and they require at least one foreign language

		metadata and i chose traditional chinese which

		then had to be augmented by simplified chinese...

		i could not imagine doing this for thirty songs...

		would you? the lyrics of it's a long way to the top

		if you want to rock and roll never mentioned such

		tedious work involved in getting one's music out...

		for reference; (low fi)<br>

-------<br>

well, stuck inside of mobile with the memphis blues again did

	sort of say there was some sort of repetition involved

		in the "creative" process; smoking eyelids

		and punched cigarettes...

ashes when i have tray time i will see if there is another

way to get the other songs out in the format they already have...

i listened to it again thinking sure it's not a hit but it is not

run of the mill...usually it's books that go out of print...

to have this happen to songs is beyond bizarre...

sort of like gogol's the nose! 

well, here's wishing you all a decent thanksgiving. <br>

		27 november...i dreamt yesterday that iwas

		flying to to europe from the states...germany

		i suppose as that is a recurring scene in my

		dream mind...in this case the airport and 

		luggage were all very detailed - someone was 

		speaking as if asking questions, not sure what

		i said...did recall a pre-dream nightmare

		wherein i am talking to my sister as if

		hypnotized...she had actually dropped by -

		then again yesterday with her motley crew...

		went to sleep late smoking and wondering why

		lotta was still in new york...i dreamt playing

		guitar with the stones and trying to figure out

		some song about a feline in the key of c major...

		i got up early feeling tired all day - but it was

		rainy and i rather enjoy the downpour...she got

		miu miu eyewear and was on her way to the plane...

		i actually have not taken the time for notes or

		chords although i did make a leather strap for

		the ibanez...the idea was that not playing my

		daily scales would help her in some way...silly 

		yet it satisfied something in my thoughts...

		or more correctly in my superstition - 

		anyway i am looking ahead to getting back in 

		rhythm tomorrow...besides, in skipping the 

		thanksgiving shingdig, i will have the evening

		all to my self, well myself and skirt...

		had not heard the song flight 505, well five

		days left of hosting after tomorrow  as the 

		guest leaves early on the first week of december.

		word to the wise, don't dare miss say or see 

		singing one of the blitz songs in the studio, 

		it is exceptional or to kick at madonna's nerves

		some; it is neat. 

		<br>
		30 november...weird watery dream wherein there 

		was a screen embedded into the faucet handel

		of the shower...it resembled one of those

		ancient portable tv screens but smaller...

		invention dream; shower faucets with media 

		screens...

		hmm...then of course i did not have a free

		thanksgiving as my guest decided not to go out -

		at least the lions won...memories of detroit 

		swirled in thought...then further into childhood

		and my jacket...they have never gone all way -

		i really liked that jacket...you gotta lose

		your mind in detroit rock city...billy idol

		covered bob dylan's if not for you, i heard

		grace slick talking and was amazed by her 

		honesty - but how is time magazine ten dollars?

		back to scales, felt no lapse. guest did venture

		out to visit someone else and so i do have part 

		of taday free...in a moment of idk browsed the 

		perlude to moby dick and thought melville had

		influenced me more than i realized...lotta left

		via  gate 65 and arrived, an hour late, via gate

		66...i thought the detail was quirky...lauren 

		got a ritual candle and robyn erased her kill 

		bill halloween pictures which i now miss...

		third day of pizza but my stomach has been sensitive

		for two days...i didn't expect, at this point, any 

		dream recall at all yet last night the scenes were

		pretty particular - as if i had married virginia 

		and one of her children was even calling me daddy...

		then moving into an apartment which was more like 

		a mailbox building or perhaps the locker in the 

		substance where the packages are delivered...

		everything seemed so compact...i always feel this

		place itself is too big for one person but i like

		the options of several rooms...in the one room 

		dream i sensed sister invading thought as she had

		said she was going to an apartment hotel for the

		weekend and when this happens i always wonder which

		one of her known relations has slipped into my place

		as if i were him or the like? well they are scheduled

		to leave on tuesday as well as my guest...
		
                great fun with the story of the fruit vendor who

		sold a banana which was used to make art and then

		eaten by a millionaire...that antique song that

		said bananas have to ripen in a special comes to 

		mind...cheers.
		<br>
		december one
		<br>
		sunday - i first heard it within everyone says i love

		you...marshall brickman gone at eighty five...nap

		snapped into song, 'i got a notion to love you 

		all day' heard it as if had already been wroted...

		dream in the park i talk too much and can't think of

		what to say then say, i contain multitudes, which is

		a song that was alredy wroted yet i only have a vague

		memory of it since i concentrated on murder most foul

		and later on key west philosopher pirate...

		this was not intended to segue from herman, but such

		is life...late at night a flood of emotions resolving

		in hunger that made me get up again for bread and

		ironically coffee...awoke minutes before nine - dream

		lotta's mother seemingly setting up lunch or some 

		meal in a very exact way...i'm not sure, but it was

		pretty impressive and for a minute i wondered trying

		to figure out the scene aside from inner intuition 

		what it was about...like a self interview, is she

		telling me something, i usually don't eat much but

		there is no need to set up a table meal, i should

		get up and look after my guest, it seems dark but

		the foil on the windows doesnt let the sun in, if

		it is lotta's mother then why do i feel attracted,

		oh no i am excited, now how am i going to explain this...

		the misfits is on prime. i'm in the middle of grand hotel,

		i've been in the middle of it ever since the guest arrived...

		the list of films was updated but my viewing list is now

		way overdue...nothing can be done about til tuesday...

		<br>
		monday two december <br>

		after waking up way too early, i returned to sleep, 

		and woke up a bit late...i'd been thinking about

		presidential pardons and sir elton john's eyes...

		my guest continually invites me to new york...

		i suppose it makes me dream of the city. well,

		the parts that i know...you cannot actually know

		a town like that...every few streets might be 

		like entering a different country...even the

		seemingly empty spaces like tenth avenue on the

		west side or york avenue on the east are entirely

		different types of desolation...one feels industrial

		and the latter feels richly secluded even like a 

		suburb - at least that is my feeling. i suppose

		it was more in the middle, in the mid town area

		perhaps right below columbus circle...i sense the

		crowd and the countless lights, some woman asks me

		if i am drug dealer...i think only dh marks fits

		into that category...how many names bring back 2016...

		too many. i say no, quickly thinking of the ad,

		say no to dr-ugs and hoping that at least some of

		my stories and songs are addictive. meanwhile the

		cinema list has surpassed two thousand five hundred

		titles with additions from the silvia pinal filmography.

		mexican film has not had a good day in years, my favorite

		is el esqueleto de la senora morales...
		<br>
		december 4. pre departure dream sitting knees up on the
		
		the floor beside the conclusion of some sort of trap-door

		slide where a girl gently crashes into me, i could see she

		had arrived with someone else yet he vanished and we lay

		there with sort of embraced legs, it felt like until i 

		went seemingly backwards into the trap-door and down

		with a falling naked feeling which was suddenly dressed

		and dressed again by what i can only describe as mail

		bag pouches with a much softer material...say they were

		heavy cotton yet these were soft linen with the same 

		sand coloring although neither beige nor tan...

		subsequently my guest left. given that it was mom,

		well, it sure seemed to be her once in a while, i

		felt utterly alone. weird how one can get used to 

		living by one's self yet seeing and serving another

		underlines the desolation, redefines it...ruins the

		illusion of what it means to be content...the girl in

		the scene i thought was kia, in other scenes there

		are other people in the house and mom is cleaning to

		which i react in opposition against the mop...stomping

		on one fellow as if a wrestling match...last night

		dreaming of walking down a road the type that is 

		sleek asphalt yet surrounded by forest...strangers

		gathered, surrounded...for some reason i argued that

		i could not be detained because i needed to get back

		to help mother. i felt danger in the outnumbered

		position like a dying man circled by vultures...

		i cleaned my room which had been neglected for 

		cleaning the rest of the apartment, i learned the

		word semiotics which i don't like and will possibly

		never use in conversation...i learned the chords

		of a song for you and heard the story of how sir

		elton john saved leon russell from the ditch on 

		the road of life...yet it seems he was supposed

		to be a sort of underground giant, i mean even 

		as much music as i hear, i only met his songs

		because i searched out will the circle be unbroken

		once upon a time a few months ago...strange. 

		i suppose bertrand and later kurt possessed the

		name so fully that no one else has a shot with it...

		in a dream i am working and a girl is trying to 

		get me to continue working without pay and in return

		she will flash me her tits fifty thousand times giving

		me an example preview...pink red nipples i could

		hardly remember her face thereafter as she turned

		away leaving me with the image of her chest...a man

		starts speaking perhaps asking if it is a deal but

		i think i only start making excuses...later shopping

		but also sweeping dirt from the floor...something

		is missing from the items i ordered at the last place

		and another woman is shwoing me the options...eight

		o'clock closing in on nine now...my to do list involves
		
		eating, taking out the trash, and laundry...hopefully 
		
		everyone else is gearing up for christmas the only

		x-rated holiday that isn't sexual. 

		<br> december 5. the reason for a song for you was

		to play it everyday, but in the irony of life it 

		got entwined with my thoughts of mother...

		therefore, i opted for deep elem blues which also

		gives me a lot more options in terms of improvisation

		with lead riffs...i think i have the chords and some

		fills now i need to learn the words...will record it

		when it comes along...took a nap after meal and doing

		what i wanted or needed from my to do things, but then

		i was up late mostly thinking of lotta as if possessed

		by something that was never exact, never explained...

		time swimming like an olympic swimmer into dawn before

		i knew it. nothing in dream thought and it seemed some

		one due to proximity had invaded the scene wherein i am

		standing there listening to a story about how some people

		were living in a stranger's apartment and some other people

		questiong what they would do when the stranger arrived...

		in other words nothing that felt relevant to me...

		yet i note it as i don't make up dreams, maybe it will make

		sense down the line. alliteration in the news, deny defend

		depose, with at least one outlet also employing the word

		divulge...from the fourteenth century etymology ;

		"Middle English, from Anglo-French deposer,
		
		from Late Latin deponere (perfect indicative deposui), 
		
		from Latin, to put down"

		nobody should get shot outside any hotel but i like that

		'depose' is in circulation as it were...oh sweet mamma

		your daddy's got them deposed blues...

		<br>
		december 6.  i reglimpsed the start of grand hotel, 1932...

		then picked up where i had left it two weeks ago when my

		guest arrived. i will try to note my reaction without 

		spoilers and explain the sensation...there are two aspects,

		i went into it trying to understand greta garbo and then 

		upon watching trying not to mix up barrymore with klein...

		there was also the buzz in my thoughts that brought me to 

		it which was lotta having a family dinner at the grand hotel

		stockholm wearing one of the sweetest sweaters i have ever 

		seen...well there then, this movie is very good and i could 

		nearly understand the gg hype...however no luck with klein

		vs barrymore...still, the emotion overpowers the contrasting

		or rhyming appearance and at a certain point all i was thinking 

		about was the character and maybe the pocketbook...it is one

		of those films to view a few times merely for the fact that

		- as ms hynde sings - they don't make 'em like they used to...

		someone tried to make a production of me throwing out the 

		old sony radio or maybe all my attempts to get to sleep early

		converged into an irony that kept me up late again...

		i sure did dream something, i think now of lauren's neat

		drawers - maybe she got her christmas decorations done -

		i can't say what it was since i awoke sort of hounded by

		someone at the ten oclock hour...did i look too pale?

		why on earth is it that some people cannot simply agree

		to disagree...a line from license to kill resounds in 

		thought, dylan or the management that runs his tweet

		spoke of the film "based" on him or who he used to be...

		myself i refuse to see anything that actor is in since

		a rainy day in new york...because he was so helpful in

		firing up the witchhunt against the director...anyway

		cate blanchett prolly did a better bob in i;m not here

		or was it there...i'm not there...you ain't goin' nowhere...

		seven deadly sins magnitude kaliphornkneeah, they said after

		one man in butte county said to himself hey let me shoot

		at the kindergarden kids meanwhile a falling statue killed an

		eight year old in the next door state...
		
		not a good day to be child in america...

		otherwise i feel good, maybe not in the james brown way,

		yet good enough that if someone tells me to play that funky

		music, white boy, i could or possibly would. now then for

		woody; www.nytimes.com/2024/12/02/movies/woody-allen-marshall-brickman-q-and-a.html

		wherein you will learn about the word Anhedonia...

		<br>
		december 7. pearl harbors before natalia's birthday. i thought about the

		nearly logical thread that ran all the way from that film into london

		boulevard...don't be upset if i didn't mention joan crawford, she will

		be put placed prominently on the list...i viewed the great beauty -

		the opening only confused me and felt as if the director was teasing

		the audience...or like someone reluctant to let in the crowd to see

		the plot...yet it developed nicely...partly eclectic and partly 

		ironic...especially at the end which contains a great gift in the

		form of music; the beatitudes by vladimir martynov. 

		(kronos quartet)
		
		a piece that floats in a space all its own and cannot be contained

		by descriptive words, it has to be heard then one might give it

		an emotional setting upon each individual listen which could run

		the spectrum of several feelings...

		i got up well after noon after a long night thinking about lotta

		as i learned the nine months ago story when she missed a trip

		to portugal...in my dreams i was sitting somewhere where i could

		see the stairs...staring at the stairs instead of stars go figure;

		i hear the explosion that preceeds fire and see a man race up

		as if he had just set the nearby building, which in my dream mind

		i knew to be a drug den, ablaze...i thought well some people can

		never win but coldly as if empathy and myself had lost touch...

		later, certainly even colder, i am sitting elsewhere, trying to

		avoid another man as one of his friends arrive smiling at me

		like i am salvation personified...i don't like these people 

		yet in my dream mind there is a real illumination, a wisdom

		that leaves me miles away from them even as they near then

		one of them mentions not having anyone to help him although

		the other one is still there...i take it as jab at my aloof

		state of mind and for a second i am forced to look at them

		as if there were no stars in the skies only to awake wishing

		i had not had that dream and still feeling the slime of their

		greed as i walked into the hallway to fix the start of the day.

		<br>
		december 8. i had read that the rebels took Homs and were

		entering Damascus as the dream i didn't note flashed in memory

		where i was either licking or tickling a woman and suddenly

		could not escape the squirting streaming into my face...

		i don't know much, but i do know that cate left her career

		to be with kevin and i havent seen him in anything since

		the christmas balls movie...i then read that assad fled

		syria- luxury cars on display at the telegraph...

		which made me think deny defend depose was pre-coded to

		announce the toppled regime...but i think too much when it

		comes to these things...in my mind what was truly interesting

		was hearing cole porter at stella a life since that is when

		i really felt admiration for kevin yet had not seen barrymore

		uhm so there i was in another film with him in mind well with

		him and elvis costello did let's misbahve on that soundtrack...

		but the film and paula beer is a powerhouse...not to mention

		that it is a true story...my only question with it was the 

		failure to clearly claim the fact that many of the jews were

		also german - some even more so than the "germans" - it is 

		hinted via the lead's father; noted as a war veteran but i 

		felt that irony needed to be fleshed out a bit more. anyway

		to see jews working as gestapo agents in berlin gives such

		a rollercoaster ride of emotions that is like a drug...

		so very high with this film, indeed. STELLA. EIN LEBEN.

		then the shooter outside the hilton hotel and the rebel

		leader were identified in social media and in the press

		although it will most likely not be confirmed until tomorrow -

		i can only confirm that i dreamt of being in another house

		and sighing in the knowledge that the sink could not be used

		while observing someone open the faucet and watching the

		waterworks spill out from the sides and the pour down from

		the ceiling...there was a broken toilet in the corner next

		to the centered toilet...which caught my attention, usually

		there might be a bidet but who knows...so happy to write this

		as in a typo i came up with the word onserving...the cashier

		was onserving coins on the receipt upon the counter...

		in another dream uppermarket, why am i there, i am intent on

		getting exactly three items, cigarettes and two other things

		not as important as marlboros but there is a man with a beer

		belly buying sandwiches and i can see the filled bread and 

		i can feel him stand way too near as he put places his arm

		across my shoulders and starts to sway as if in celebration

		which i cannot understand squirming with a shrug awaking...

		when the ick is onserved one must pick out distance to be 

		preserved...i get up and pick lotta to worship and extend

		the distance from that dream...yet as i do i see froseth 

		pictured with a man eerily like the one in the tuppermarket

		scene. so the two jakes, jack was right. it never goes away.

		ps, bring back spy magazine so i can submit the separated

		at birth photograph of the actor in kiev alongside

		Abu Mohammed al-Jawlani...or as mellish said, I object, your honor!
		
		This trial is a travesty. It's a travesty of a mockery of a sham
		
		of a mockery of a travesty of two mockeries of a sham...

		meanwhile i have heard the deposed leader is already in moscow,

		not idaho.
		 <br>
		9 december.  sunday i somehow sidestepped the loud talk outside and

		the man yelling super colmado over and over as i had my pizza and settled

		into blitz with high hopes since i thought the coat song was really 

		special but i can only recomment the soundtrack..cheesier than the pie,

		it pulls at the audience via emotional traps plus put placing lectures

		all along the way as if the viewer needed lessons in social studies...

		it might be the only film to feature a dwarf and still not be worth 

		watching...all mouth and no trousers might well be said of itself...

		if you look at it closely you'll notice say or see asking herself

		what the hell am i doing here...the director supposedly wrote it

		but was it a joke poking at curious george? nobody could write such

		a thing! of course, we all want a perfect society and equality yet

		celluloid like this is more dangerous than helpful...if only the

		producers would now have to take the mta to get around balancing

		the cost of this corny turkey...they hit all the notes but it still

		lacks truth and sounds hollow unlike the lead's fine voice. 

		enoch powell is possibly turning over in his grave...

		i put this all out of mind asap and even managed to get to sleep

		early yet awoke too soon...i dreamt i was drinking although i don't,

		there was some argument and i was wearing a scuba diving suit inside

		a brick walled room that looked like a bunker or basement...i could

		hear someone screaming like i had during the day and stepped out of

		slumber wondering how to get back to sleep but wrote this instead...

		hmm to think i=of it blitz takes place partly in the timeline of

		stell a life, but there is something exceptional in the german

		while the english only has that bit of irish magic to hold it 

		together yet even the magical needs a logical poise.  there is 

		a moment when she is saved from a falling wall left over from

		air raid and hopefully this will be manifested in her career. 

		i love say or see but i did not like this fiasco of manipulation

		and propaganda. 
		<br>
		december 10. as i squandered most of my day in the secret spaces

		of self reflection, fantasy, and escape i started to feel well

		what hamlet said, i lack advancement...had i never wroted a 

		poem song story novel screenplay...had i never done anything...

		perhaps it was zen or a sartorial stance...i felt empty as in

		devoid of motivation...i did need to go out and was confronted

		by someone telling me he was desperate as one of his something

		or other needed a pint a blood which he claimed cost a lot...

		i tried to be polite but i doubt there was any truth in it...

		as i pondered further, i finally said to myself why am i even

		contemplating this void within...if it is depression then it

		should be respected...to lose parts of oneself is no trivial 

		matter and when it happens in slow motion as it is with aunt

		and mother well there is silent ongoing mourning that cannot

		be explained...so i held myself together saying there is no

		need to hurry past this time...i waited for lotta to post

		but she was at a christmas business party...i kept seeing

		julia wulf on social media and at some point was even tempted

		to write a poem for brooke pufky as i thought back to her 

		extreme kindness and how the world could use love like that

		which instead is focused on her children - but i figure

		one day those kids will be in the world and it will be a 

		better place because of her...when i talked about that film

		which baffled me by its lack of logic, i noticed that is was

		the coin that somehow remained in the hankerchief pocket

		despite the leap from the moving train and further that 

		there is royalty with that name but i don't want to repeat

		myself to myself on these matters...i had glanced at silk 

		and butter - some sort of agency - well silk&butter ug
		
		and in my dream, well there was this very clear vision 
		
		of helena pre-dream as i stretched into sleep, lotta

		saying i never read a poetry book...
		
		i was surrounded by several women

		none of them familiar yet very pretty and well dressed but

		ravenous especially with the butter, we all had bread but

		it made me start to scoop up a bit more butter thinking they

		would leave none for lotta...yes indeed weird given that

		i gave up purchasing the product being that they want

		nearly four dollars for a stick and more when it is a 

		a luxury brand meanwhile the domestic variety is simply

		a greasy disaster...so yeah some prices make no sense,

		bacon here costs more than steak...i had previously awoken

		haunted or hunted by words i had said, i wondered if my

		uncle had died. the thoughts so swift there was no chance

		to distinguish meaning, for example one of his sons is named

		michael yet in mind or memory i instead saw kilmer and then

		thought about how much i liked dylan's version of things

		we said today...yet all this in milliseconds as i awoke 

		leaving behind whatever it was i had dreamt about...

		i went back to sleep and got up in the late morning

		with nothing to report - skirt had two cans of trout

		friskies yet still pressed me for milk...i think now

		it is good enough that i slept easy so why worry if i 

		miss a scene from rapid eye movement. i feel so right

		and logical in this type of thinking because it is true

		and positively should have no need to prove myself

		further...ps, cool minute as joan corrects the daily

		mail over dallas, son volt started playing in mind;

		looking at the world through a windshield...

		much better than the warlord killing a hundred ten

		folks over the voodoo sensation blame or the naked lookalike

		that was too much emilee grant on the heels of having

		thought of her wondering if it was a fake...girls, 

		if you snapchat nudes they might end up on amaleaked...

		or elsewhere - there then now i am going to escape into

		leftover pizza and the heretic - open letter to hugh;

		thank you mister mickey blue eyes but please don't give

		no more cigars to the children or at least consider

		giving them filtered cigarettes if smoking is the point. 

		<br>
		december 11. there are times when even if it feels nothing

		is going down - or going ahead - there is still or might be

		a sensation that one is where one is meant to be...

		that is what i thought watching heretic...which i would have

		appreciated less before reading robert graves' the white goddess.

		i don't want to get into religion as the facts can't stand

		against faith...i do want to wish for a prequel wherein the

		reed house is decorated and detailed...in any case, this really

		was like taking a drug and it is possible that i am still high

		from it. oh wait back to my point about timing, this one is a

		stretch but allow me to play with the thought...so after 

		my george rant, this picture signals the landlord game which

		i learn was created to make people aware of georgism...

		thy letters have transported me beyond this ignorant 

		present and i feel now the future in the instant...

		please note it is a horror film although the golden globes

		might tell you later it is a comedy or musical...

		let me move on, further into now...or then to be precise,

		i have gone to sleep twice, the first time as i drifted away

		into what i am terming pre-dream state, i heard a clear

		bit of conversation where someone was trying to edit a book

		of mine, it sounded like a suggestion but also like someone

		pretending to be writing it...pretty upsetting for a writer

		to ponder if there is a rewrite happening without his 

		consent...who knows? perhaps it was an anxiety from the 

		film...by the way if you stay for the credits you will find

		the disclaimer that no generative artificial intelligence

		was used to create this a24 production...i went to work

		on the cinema list and exceeded my expectations although

		i have yet to update the synonym site...when i finally

		got to dreams, i was surprised to see lotta since i usually

		don't dream of her even if very often in my thoughts and

		musings...i can't recall the scene exactly yet i remember

		thinking how beautiful she looked therein as if really

		seeing her. so bright, so right. i left dreams and 

		felt determined to sort out a meal plan and get the kitchen
		
		in order yet i got into this scribble jot note awith

		coffee and cigarette and suddenly feel like writing a bit

		more - or at least thinking about putting pen to paper

		as it were except it is too soon as my horse novel is still

		being settled and i sense that the white goddess deserves 

		another run through simply to get to missed secrets in the

		clutter of connections...so many names and myths...wednesday

		well i have the fuck kill or marry film yet no idea if the kitchen

		will succeed or what to cook...
		<br>
		12 december. did the kitchen while listening to the haunting of

		hill house by shirley jackson which i liked more than expected...

		i found that pretending the cleaning was for someone else made it

		all easier...as for the film, well you couldn't really call it a

		film since it was a sort of sitcom where you could tell which 

		places the commercials would go...a strange pilot that puts place

		a woman in a position to date while a serial killer is hunting

		dating women...exasperating? well, maybe insane. i felt awful

		for lucy, it seemed to me she had some success in recent movies

		and might possibly be sort of upgraded but here she is with

		motley crew of wanna be leading men which only bring her down

		to their level...a sort of b-movie straight to video on demand

		type...i think the popular term now is cringe...i blame the

		abc seven year run as she ends up with the ags guy a sort of

		carboard cut out with a beard...yes i know comedy is very 

		difficult to pull off but to not have one good laugh makes

		it feel as if a hatchet job to sideline ms hale to the ranks

		of john ritter - southworth - although he did manage to be

		in bad santa before the end...i'd have to look up what the

		failed show called life with lucy was about if this were

		to be an essay...it ain't. still a third film adaptation

		of THOHH in slapstick style would've made more sense...

		i mean if you have a split personality comedy/horror then

		the source material should be something worth it. 

		"Don't do it - Eleanor told the little girl; insist on your

		cup of stars, once they have trapped you into being like

		everyone else you will never see your cup of stars again..."

		see how good that writing is...too good. well, maybe they

		thought the title was powerful enough, but this was 

		very far from being the tits.  my apologies to elisabeth

		moss for always thinking of her when i think of shirley 

		jackson. now then, the book along with lotta's hello 

		fresh video helped me displace that film, dispose of it

		as i wondered why there are so few blue cars around...

		i played my scales and ran through deep elem blues...

		but got caught up for hours trying to figure out how

		to judge the death of the last survivor of the kamikaze

		attack and make it rain in malibu...when i did sleep,

		i thought i was with lotta yet i am nearly sure it

		was inka and we were laying upon some road where a

		stones played we were both singing along but i only

		heard her voice as i missed some of the words then 

		we walked into a theater, the ancient type i guess

		you'd call it ampitheater...i awoke then wondering

		if i had dreamt of williams or stichler...most likely

		williams who subsequently spoke of the stupidity of

		people on the roads in baliland...why are the b- shoes

		so good, bally's - bruno magli - she was featured in 

		an arabian magazine and i am happy for her although

		the dream sort of baffles me...i have a wish for 

		crocodile shoes now that i have seen them in saks,

		if only to dance to elton's crocodile rock...lalalalaaaaa...

		it is not entirely a serious wish, call it a whim...

		but it is like those overpriced watches, i'd rather

		spend that type of money on guitars...where was i not

		strumming in another dream, jennifer is there and i

		don't think we spoke much except maybe about white 

		boy rick which i liked alot and believe to be a 

		true story if memory serves...it;s noon time or

		midnight in asia and the lights went out derailing

		my train of thought which switched to boulder colorado...

		where that fuck marry kill was set, no wonder the 

		fraternity news said six students had overdosed...

		disembodied poetics, perhaps it's time to review

		the burroughs' lucktures from nairopa...craig

		is getting raves for his performance and i am 

		secretly hoping he will pull the sean connery

		return stunt somewhere down the line as bond. 

		spies used to be termed ghosts so it might

		still make sense... meanwhile i am reluctantly going to check out

		'emilia perez' not that i listen to hype but

		so i can see for myself...hey, selena, continued success

		to you.

		<br>
		13 december. well that was really something out of the

		ordinary...conversational songs that were not trite

		for the most part, yeah for the most part there is 

		nothing to complain about here except it did not 

		make sense for a person in hiding, or even simply

		trying to turn a new leaf, to go into the limelight...

		but i see how it added tension...so i liked it even

		if i protest the newsy interviews of the protagonist.

		cheers or bravo...hmm, i am writing this about an hour

		after going to sleep...it is still the wee hours but

		my dream was so weird that it delivered a jolt as it were;

		there is a gathering of people in the living room and 

		i don't like one of the men there but i go to bed

		after feeding skirt who was wounded in the scene

		and i had to lift him up for the plate noticing there

		a flattened sort of foreleg paw, in my thinking i 

		chalk it up to the kids running around carelessly

		as it seems there were also children then as if reflecting

		or foreshadowing itself i get up from bed quickly dressing

		intent on kicking out the man i dislike, as i dress i can 

		hear mother agreeing to go to the shop and return to cook

		some sort of meal which she is excited over, i grab the 

		keys and make my way down the hall - on the kitchen counter

		a record is playing, vinyl, i want to love you night and day

		it is singing in a doowoop style heavy on the vocals, male

		vocals, i had been wondering how could i see myself and for

		a second worried about some recording device in the apartment,

		i start telling no one in particular that that man cannot be

		in my house while reaching to shut off the spinning song -

		i get up shocked that only minutes have transpired...i take

		out the trash still confused by the crowd in a dream within

		the place that contains only myself and skirt...the sensation

		was frightening as i felt it was something urgent yes like

		blood rushing to the head yet there is atruth contained in

		it and that is that there are people who i avoid based on

		some instinct, some perception, some inner wisdom which

		has served me well. catching my breath as it were, i 

		wonder if robert graves was right that the white goddess

		will haunt the poet until his muse is properly satisfied...

		will battle against his distractions and even his wealth

		to keep the need or desire to exceed his own verses...

		i listen to another chapter of the haunting of hill house

		but i am thinking more about lotta than the narrative...

		a lot more in fact.

		<br>
		14 december. the inclination or inspiration to write

		is with me yet i pause trying to decide which dream

		or thought to put place first...first place put the

		misfits, i had for years wanted to ear it and hear

		what it would yield, to see it and wear what it would

		yield...once upon a time, when i wrote the biographical

		story entitled baptism by desire, i visited a book shop

		where there was only one tome on clift and where the 

		clerk said why not ask eli wallach...i didn't realize

		he lived nearby although some time later i saw him

		while we both walked west end avenue but i was

		done with the story by then and i'm not one to 

		intrude...but the point is i went into the misfits

		last night...it's a good time too since back then 

		i would only have thought of clark gable as the 

		gone with the wind character unaware of his past,

		his genius past - i could say the same for john huston,

		which would only have registered as prizzi's honor but

		now especailly after seeing 1960s unforgiven there is 

		a more complete sense of what it means...still it wasn't

		the men...it was marilyn  and it was alot more monroe

		than say monkey business which is where i saw her last -

		now all the hoopla makes sense to me and i'm really excited

		to see the rest of it and to a lesser extent dirty angels...

		i wonder if this is the one where eva had to go through a 

		lawsuit...i wonder what wild stories john huston told

		arthur miller on the set of that production...correction

		i might have recalled that director as an actor in chinatown.

		sometime before that significant evening for myself, i had

		a point of confusion as to the brand of jacket lotta wore...

		in thinking of zara or mango i thought of saramago the scribe

		of 'blindness' and illustrated the uncertainty in commentized 

		form...i only bring it up because a minute ago the news reports

		the founder of mango fell off a cliff...for the obvious reason,

		i thought it weird but also for the fact that i thought mango

		was by penelope;s sister...night and the middle of the night hours

		crawled by lazy after a terrbily breezy day...turbo ily shadows

		while listening to the haunting of hill house...telegraph said

		cherry hill who would take up to seven years to build toy scale

		model steam trains had rolled on into what must be an intricate

		afterlife...theodora is not the easiest name for me to hear...

		then too the narrator when playing the professor sounds exactly

		like christopher waltz...listening to the dead play cold rain

		and snow...i'm going where those chilly winds don't blow...

		well literally this late morning although still not seeing

		the sky in dream i had this sensational adventure with lotta

		as if meeting her at the station, the one in sweden, although

		she is presently ingermany, yes it didn't feel cold or windy -

		like a man in a trance enchanted...i awoke amazed and even 

		after the post-rem slumber it remained with me so that i still

		feel elated...i'm sure you know the feeling wherein nothing

		else matters much so that for a minute or so life makes sense.

		i suppose it was the setting since there was only conversation

		while we made our way around...i've heard it often, location

		is everything but now i'm a believer. i can't believe west sofia

		started a gym, well pilates workout place...it's called reform

		avenue...here's wishing her well...very well then, alexandra

		seemed to insist on something in my imagination yet i could not

		decipher it - of course, being me i worry a bit although i know

		worrying is no help - i now think of ester exposito...yet my

		instinct was that someone was trying to invade her while 

		pretending to be me as i had not had such a bizarre and 

		forceful series of thoughts...in fact with alexandra it was

		and hopefully is always extremely pleasant and helpful in 

		the sense that she is the only person to ever make me 

		consider the importance of washing my face...the other

		day i was shocked at the dirt on the dickinson's witch

		hazel towel as i scrubbed my mug and thought of her with

		that oh you were so right in that sense...anyway subsequent

		to where i was i drifted away from worry which for a second

		turned bottomless with the previous concern of when her

		shift shipped her out to deliver a few months ago...yet 

		as i consider it now the contrast of those worries was 

		like night and day...perhaps it was all overthinking yet

		i certainly felt an undefined pressure as i drifted further

		away into sleep...i say all this because everyone is important

		in their right and especially girls need more safety in our

		illogical meat grinder rat race society...methinks, meanwhile

		i fully support sonia taking over pinsk and for that matter

		all of belarus...ah yes, that was the last time i dreamt of

		the sky. sigh. yes i know too much information but blame the

		tmi on the swedish dream that is still making me feel magical

		although i pulled no rabbit out of this convoluted paragraph

		hat.
		<br>
		15 december. the john huston film from 1960 did not disappoint,

		in fact i felt it went above and beyond what anyone would have

		or could expect...my high praise however stems from the inspiration

		i found in learning about horses...he actually entered a camel

		race in the middle of directing that movie and came in first

		place...i think of mia in tracks now which also featured a 

		dog, here it was tom dooley...character from a folk song...

		well, there was something poetic and poignant as the female

		lead stood on the plains away from the men calling them 

		murderers as if a ghost of herself foreshadowing her own

		spirit;s rant upon her death august fourth of the next

		year...they had wrapped november fourth...i could be a 

		critic against montgomery's performance yet having 

		studied his life and knowing he did suffer a horrific

		car crash only a few years previous it only made me 

		grimace and in some ways cheer for him even if i didn't

		feel any emotion other than curiosity from his performance,

		but i'd expect nerves would have played a part...

		it was two in the morning euro time and lotta was still

		editing her video...i went to sleep at three yet awoke

		at five...i dreamt i was in a bed sideways on the 

		lower side opposite the headboard - there was a girl 

		under the sheets i could not see yet felt like a friend,

		mother climbed into bed and she tickled her toes until

		mother covered them then we started holding hands, the

		girl and myself as mother started to speak about me getting

		married which led to my wisecrack that tiffany wanted to 

		marry me wherein suddenly i could see tiffany in the city

		riding a bike, a purse on the handlebars which she was adjusting

		and this shift in time and space felt entirely natural - 

		i get up to pee in the dream and the girl follows, the house

		i recognize as aunt's laly old house on castillo 36 - 

		i stand by the kitchen door which i have just opened yet

		the desire to pee has left me as i look at the view which

		contradicts location...there was only a guava tree back there

		yet in the dream housing buildings stood with some windows lit -

		the locks are interlaced pads and chains and ionly used the bolt

		leaving the mystery for someone else to figure out - the girl

		now wants to pee - but other family has arrived, one of them

		taking the bathroom perhaps for a bath...well shower since there

		was never a bathtub in that house - i think for a second it's

		kia jade yet i believe she's taller...we make our way into 

		the front porch where another aunt is dressed in white and red

		in fact they all were - one of the boys even seemed to be wearing

		a dress - i say it is like the so-called gypsy roma people and

		turning away from the sour faced cousin in the dress i start singing

		here comes the bride heading back inside finding myself between two

		ladies i do not recognize but one of them is really singing the song

		in full emotional voice, she reminds me for a second of lotta's mom

		but i do not know if she can carry a tune actually, in any case i turn

		to the other lady that i somehow know is a singer and mention how well

		the other lady is belting it out...i suppose i turn to finally see who

		i am with but awake in that very moment...moodys downgraded the french

		credit score and mayotte was battered by a cyclone...although bowie

		took up most of the space in me that would grieve over the loss of 

		a loved one, as i looked at van morrison and sinead oconner's duet of

		have i told you lately on the letterman show i could see vm's antics

		bring out the true sinead and in an instant one understands her

		contradition which was both shy yet outspoken, nervous yet filled

		with admiration and desire to bring joy to the world - indeed it

		was an angel we all lost too soon...so i say to contrast with

		my thoughts spurred on by the dream as to how much northern

		land the french side of my family gave up for the sake of 

		not going to paris...or more importantly who were the ones that

		left it...i miss that house, i miss all the houses that are no 

		longer ours...they were true homes even now in dreams like

		apartment 3k is and will be...but feeling i went over board 

		writing these notes yesterday i will leave it at that for now. 

		<br>
		post-script - well i can't say i entirely understood dirty

		angels, i mean it starts with eva green being stoned which

		gave me perhaps too much to think about...from religion to

		rainy day women...then that bloody shot of her swollen face,

		this is not the lawsuit film as that was never made, ie the

		lawsuit she won a few months ago...where was i - ah yes

		then in uniform - i really liked that - i even started

		thinking we should all wear military outfits...so an action

		film and in that sense it was all right...indeed, it kept

		me watching. my only protest here is the chosen song which

		leads into the fade out credits...some bland heavy metal

		which leaves you thinking what song is that...meybe they

		thought any rock would do to come full circle with the 

		thrown stones at the start...yes i am glossing over the
		
		importance of the political side but one peek at the news
		
		will tell you how timely it is...i haven't heard of any 

		upcoming eva green projects yet i hope there are some soon.

		meanwhile  i have secured 'maria' yet it all seems so quick;

		it really feels like a few days there was an article with

		angelina jolie in oversized glasses that said she was filming...

		how could it be cut and edited and released so swiftly...

		i went to sleep again after viewing lotta's vlog and i 

		was very happy to see her so full of joy...my dreams

		flew by in a flash and i awoke to an even happier lotta

		which made me update the landing page at inkrealm.info...

		skirt has, after clawing through the leather kitchen chair,

		taken to hanging out on the dining table...so will i be

		eating in bed? he's already used up the chair part of the

		ottoman set and now rarely takes to it...like a playboy

		except it's furniture instead of women...this was an 

		unexpectly eventful sunday - well it still is, even in

		european hours there are three left, while here there

		are seven or eight left...
		<br>
		16 december. i viewed 'maria' however i don't want to

		write about it...it tells so many stories all at once

		while actually reincarnating the voice of callas and

		vividly revealing the isolation that goes hand in hand

		with fame, (although some might argue that her hallucinations

		were due to drugs) that to speak of it even in praise

		could not serve it. it was early morning in asia

		when i went to sleep exhausted for no specific reason

		other than perhaps oversleeping...my thoughts curved

		between lotta and lauren sophia...i dreamt i was walking

		home, yet the new york city version, checking the mail

		where rows of mailboxes were missing as i went into the

		other side finding some old people with no answer as 

		to why it was like that...glass door sassy woman looked

		me over as i walked upstairs...key at the door turning

		as a man approaches intent on talking about some concert

		it seemed he knew i had gone too as well, not so many

		russians this time, he smirks and i say nothing and 

		i still remain silent as he insists on entering until

		i push him out and start to shut the door...marian 

		is inside and somehow this seems normal to me...two 

		of her friends then knock on the door and tell me

		their names, i repeat the names to her and she says

		she doesn't want to be with them, i take it that

		she is tired and relate the message offering to 

		pay for their taxi...marian gives me an 828 number

		and they give me an address in queens...for a minute

		the scene settles into only us yet quickly turns

		to us walking in a part od town that is a cross

		between the village and central park west...for

		some reason lotta is now with marian and showing

		her some kind of way to walk, i suppose it is 

		something models do...they seem to get along 

		better than with me...i am sort of pleased and

		happy that they are happy as i walk up central 

		park west, then lotta climbs up on me from behind

		making me go into a run and there i am running

		yet a few strides in i feel her leg and notice 

		she is not wearing shoes...this starts to wake me

		and i get up with my touch having got to her thigh...

		i am thinking of L'amour est un oiseau rebelle and 

		how she mentioned two girls had showed up in dusseldorf

		and perhaps that was what the dream was about but i am

		not certain what she meant, that is, it was german and

		it seemed to imply fangirls or some recognition from 

		what i understood...as i think of it more i suppose

		she is concerned over the meeting tomorrow promoting

		hejgreta...i know iwould be as a lot of company's make

		these events without too much thought about security...

		i remember being shocked at lara taking a taxi and making

		her way through the street and crowd to get to one...

		hmm, or worse lila wearing wings in midtown manhattan

		struggling through pedestrians along with other models...

		and those were big name fashion houses that could surely

		afford something better for their girls...oh wait this

		has gotten into an overboard groove and in technical 

		terms it is still yesterday here although lunch time

		in asian cities.
		<br>
		17 december. in a dream i seem to have gone out with 

		only a blanket swirled around my body and for some

		reason i walk into a bakery shop  or is it more correct

		to call it a pastry shop...i thought about that pierre

		shop in wagen...it would take me while to see all the 

		pretty places i want to experience in germany...my 

		cousin would often awake like that, with the blanket

		instead of clothes...a modern day linus without the 

		piano or thumb sucking...i myself have raced to the 

		ringing phone dressed like that but only to not 

		stand naked in the living room...i decided to disregard

		the constant flow of news although i did take a stand on

		djerf wondering why women are trying to tear down a woman

		that carved out a place for herself in an impossible atmosphere...

		give em hell, matilda...yes this is partly because lotta

		likes that fashion but also i don't like the trial without

		due process or jury...that being the case i wont commentize

		on venom the last dance since i missed the second film of

		that movie trilogy...where was i...ah yes so i got a lot

		done even trimmed my toe nails...no news isnt good news

		yet it leaves a bit more space for self...i did glance

		at the wisconsin situation twice given that the star 

		of that sitcom was named natalie samantha rupnow, 

		a woman, well, a girl...amazing...i had not heard

		of female mass murderers...massage place with that

		name 2053 Detlor Rd, L'Amable, ON K0L 1C0, Canada...

		dennis thomas rupnow passed away 28 october '23,

		david ernst rupnow 4 january '22...not a common

		name but several other obits - not sure if any relate

		to her...a kid in the second grade telephoned the 

		report to authorities...honda made the nsr500 until

		2002...there are at least two agencies with the 

		abbreviation of NSR...i will peek later to see if 

		anything more might be said over this tragic or sad

		turn of events...such a nice place, madison wis...

		wish dream resulted in weird dream as mother

		was here again having let in some people that moved

		things around and so i argued until things were in

		place then in the balcony an old man had put an even

		older woman in a sort of brenda lien call of cuteness

		cat sock and i put both out into the staircase all the 

		while asking who was who as the man responded...salami

		people the size of plantains...a lot of it in spanish

		so i suspect the result of an onlooker...my right foot

		in a slow painful spasm as if i had actually been racing

		around putting the place in order...she keeps saying

		she gets up thinking she is here or that she has dreamt

		about being here...i had no idea i was such a pleasant

		host...i do have an idea that printing these notes

		looks as if it were writing yet it is not...it's not

		that i am not considering readers, no, it is more like

		what i do with musical scales...a ritual except here

		there's nothing to contain a random thought and dreams

		well, dreams are what they are...hopefully as might be

		the case in mastering notes, these unedited paragraphs

		will serve as a base or starting point for other projects...

		i'm not promising, only saying. that being said, i will

		try to be more concise down the line.
		<br>
		31 december<br>
		<br>
		dream at one of my machines - there is an alert 
		to review and back up files...i suppose the 
		obituary people are all upset as they were 
		about to wrap the year in a bow never as goodly
		as paris hilton red -there goes the grand theft
		president! not that i didn't think he'd been
		long gone for a while now - not that i didn't
		think highly of him - not as highly as willie
		nelson smoking roof - men in atlanta tryin'
		to pass for...four in the morning, mourning?
		azer - kor - eth...deadly week and to ship
		a gretsch from amazon cost the self same 
		price as the axe - i ask how...well nevermind,
		no reference to nirvana...the albino was 
		julian, libido was electric guitars, mosque-
		toe must;ve been some cousin i kissed -
		no i could not entirely escape the newsy 
		escapades -hmm gl maketh espada hh...
		i made a list of wish guitars, not that
		one...well then it seems i have a lot of
		proverbial ground to cover since sexy
		and seventeen...how many days was that -
		that was days many how...now i am not sure
		how to skip into the start, to slide into
		the past while keeping an eye on the future...
		oh yes obviously, i augmented the scale exercise
		with two new ones...which is what i wanted to 
		do upon waking but i was running out of space
		on the jot pad where upon i scribbled notes
		to make way for this passage - let's see...
		in no particular order - lotta dream conversation
		except i saw her here at the foot of my bed -
		i recall stringing out a joke which may have
                been politically incorrect well racist to simplify
		matters, and suddenly she punched me in the belly...
		i get up in between a smile and confusion...no 
		confusion over the order - a film that exceeds
		itself...i think the crucial point, aside from the
		amazing king craft on display and the several 
		shocks especially if you happened to know bm, is that
		the white power movement has been so silenced as to 
		make it perhaps more alluring in that reverse psychology
		manner that often works its way through irony i guess -
		when speaking about it i automatically equated what
		could potentially be a martyr in that movement with
		the genocide of native americans, how is the day of
		the rope any different from the goal of the calvary...
		well, i digress but back then i got to thinking about
		the whole jew blood libel hype...i wondered how could
		a 'thing' like that be sustained on mere whispers?
		i had to come to my own conclusions which i will
		retain away from the arena of these notes for the
		sake of fairness or at least to give myself time to
		actually consider any contradictions in my logic - 
		i do have a theory, but we can all agree it is a
		sensitive and rare matter...well, done i say to myself
		in secret feeling i have covered the pros and cons of
		the bases...standing on the plate i pitch myself a dream
		rib eye steak like i used to have with anya -there is
		a bare ass girl which i don't think i have seen in dreams -
		yeah usually it's the front side...i woke up thinking of
		miss mcderby bending over extremely near what was my 
		school face then she turned with a blushing smile sorry
		to which i think i only raised eyebrows grin like it's
		nothing to me hell i was not even reminded of being 
		birthed...back in the dream a girl is moving on the bed
		in snake fashion and suddenly pill prescription bottles
		are going into her upwards where the sun don't shine - 
		yes i have lived a couple of lifetimes simply wandering
		about myself around myself at the end of twenty twenty
		four, it already feels like forty years in the desert,
		some of the jottings don't mosey along, same school
		the principal says that type of handwriting means you 
		are cheap...i spend other lifetimes giving gifts to 
		complete strangers to prove him wrong...more recently 
		going in the opposite direction...mr prohartchin...
		one of the books i poured into my ear...still not
		sure if there was a sister in law or not, knots
		memory alivia like a flash bulb leading me to dream
		that emilee is pulling worms from her herself as i 
		hesitate to use the word pussy - well they looked 
		more like roots one might find in the ground...it 
		haunted me some...i wondered if it had anything
		to do with re-reading notes from underground...
		not what i remembered or possibly my state of mind 
		is more content for i thought the second part
		was hilarious..."simonov was positively surprised
		at my turning up"...not the putting down of liza...
		it was my second or even third dream recently of
		miss grant and i'd been thinking it was like saying
		simonov aloud might make one think it's semenov so 
		that lotta's sibling being emil, which once anyway
		sounded to me like email, might make for this dream
		irony...obviously sound makes a difference, it struck
		me last night as the 'colmado' exterior voiced resounded
		and then returned that the root cannot tell which way
		it will go...el colmado question mark buzz no buzzer
		but shout it out loud...even thinking of it now derails
		the writing - twilight zone - ah yes i even dreamed
		of a delivery but that was pizza as if watching it
		from the porch looking down onto the avenue...dear
		putin please win but don't bomb lviv as west sofia
		has set up a pilates place therein...party scene
		large house or hotel suite girl with me entwined
		just like that other sitting dream huh yeah somewhere
		yet herein i get up notice a room full men laying
		on the floor all erect like the dead kennedy poster
		come to life with hard ons reaching for something,
		for someone ? i continue into another bedroom
		and i see tom with several women on the bed motions
		me to join i rest there with the entwined girl you 
		would say it is weird but i will awake and explain 
		that i had viewed rock of ages - back in the dream
		i get up and head to the kitchen where i start eating
		rice but more is cooking the blonde is serving -
		some plates have beans...i think of one of my lyrics
		"uptown they like their rice frijolin"...i forget which
		song its from when i rise from the dream i feel dirty
		yet also concerned over suri...not yet making the 
		connection to the movie with the monkey...well there
		were several other films too, best one was the german
		'sleep' - storm over lisbon was mediocre yet in parts
		memorable, idiot;s delight...early clark gable, over the
		top peace protest yet a haunting ending...anora i felt
		was cheap in contrast to all souls...btw that was an
		excellent font in the end credits...really cute kid in
		that making her debut...here's wishing her well. 
		no easy transition from child actor to actor if that
		is or will be the case...very few guitars come with
		cases - some people in a dream are mourning phil -
		i try for empathy not having much room for defining
		the meaning after bowie...i bow to inka baffled by
		the following dream...the huffing and puffing is
		real...no flashing lights in my eyes - she's next
		me like some sort of magic spell, telling me she
		loves me - we are smoking a joint that is weed
                i wonder over the saliva not knowing if it was
		her or me...a song is playing far away, 'just
		the way we used to' which i had not heard before -
		the time before i looked her up seeing she had just
		arrived from a trip...was i tripping, in another
		dream yes one of the flights leaves at one thirty
		and i suppose i am trying to make it yet i meet
		a girl in a hotel twice then waking up before flying -
		mother continually repeats that she dreamt she was
		here with me and the cat - after dozens of times i 
		dream of her with dalva visiting, i am holding a
		bottle of bailey's irish cream - father at the door
		with some stranger i push them both into a corner
		easily as they are drunken...i ask mom to select the
		goblets for her drink, in the cabinet i see gold
		trimmed snoopy glasses - i seem to be in a hurry - 
		i get up feeling someone is trying to kill me, not
		paranoid but feeling pushed into the land of the
		deceased...twice dreamt aunt's house...weird man
		'interviewing' mom...i had been reading haunted
		hill house and i felt the prose falter here and there
		yet as it concluded i recalled one of my cousins
		had a house in a place called portal which holds a
		bit longer pronounciation outside of english...anyway
		i can't say that place was haunted but there certainly
		was some sort of possessive spirit...it took hold of
		dad once upon a time and most memorable was the instance
		which it took hold of that cousin in question...he awoke
		driving in his underwear entirely beyond sleep walking,
		slumber driving...i mean if it happens to one person
		you'd argue what it was but as it transpired to a couple
		of people a couple of times...well, shirley jackson's
		fiction cannot be simply defined or dismissed...
		indeed the very story led then to binge watching 
		the veil which i do not hesitate to recommend - neat 
		blazing action sequence akin to slow horses...intense.
		as if in a spy world and isnt it? i also binged on
		liaison but one of the characters reminded me of the
		train station slasher which made me uneasy although
		i will say that every once in a while i felt as if i
		was actually in france for the way the city was
		presented...in separate scenes i was viewing dance
		videos but picking at my skin as if mucus from nose
		with a sense of disgust and then worry that i was being
		watched...pretty news lady friendly in the maria luisa
		manner...it's been too long since i;ve been in italy -
		pasta with her felt divine - other self dream found me
		staring at my face but liking that my eyes didn't look 
		so puffy...cure for bags...sunglasses...please don't
		hit me lotta...dream of lotta showing me pictures in 
		a slide motion like one scrolls on social media except
		these were none of the ones i've seen her post...dream again
		simply standing in front of me - i suppose i would share
		my olives with her...olivia led me to india which led 
		me to 'look away' an above average reel with a very
		clever maria/airam mirror image angle...of course she
		is awful pretty so i would have to see it again to say
		anything as i kept thinking how beautiful sometimes
		or how she looked too young for such an extreme film -
		i suspect she was twenty two or so but looked twelve
		in some places...previously bizarre uncle and other cousin
		dream where there is talk of radames being dead, i only
		have a vague idea of who that might have been and none
		as to his living status...it's an apartment but past the
		hallway which i traverse having to squeeze by a man i 
		do not know, perhaps radames...there is a cash register
		without buttons yet opens with all the usual components
		and cash more like euros than dollars...there seems to be
		no system to it...it seems to be about a bag of cement...
		there is a white car outside right at the entrance door...
		years ago i seem to have a notion that there was a joke
		equating cement with semen...i thought then it was merely
		the sound like word play...when i heard men speak of it,
		then much more recently i connected cement with a more
		devious connotation as in a woman being cemented which 
		i figure could have several meanings and is not well
		not that i know of related to walks of fame squares...
		speaking of squares...boxes, in guitar search aftermath
		i dream beatles, well paul possibly - but then a sort
		of warehouse with hundreds of them...a couple of guys 
		are throwing them down below...i doubt anyone has ever 
		counted how many guitars exist...no walrus - i will
		be thanking kramer next month...i thank my muses now
		dear me only a few hours before it's twenty five in
		asian cities meat i made it so good but the next day 
		it tasted like alpo...switzerland is my bucket list,
		i'm not really upset at juliette...i thought ralph was
		on point in the return - like a slow poem that spins
		a wicked wisdom...why did i return to these notes now,
		well in case ms haas asks over my vision board...i
		didn't want my club sandwich christmas to be a point
		of discussion- afire, well no i didn't like that one. 
		although it made me realize i didn't know what oncology
		meant...it only reminded me of the old timer bullies
		that made you say uncle while stepping on some part of
		your body...oh wait in that wormy roots dream there
		was a very specific stereo the type with two big speakers
		on either side...music coming from it like u2 but i hear
		my voice...a bit low on the mix it seemed while trying
		to tempt other versions via the equalizer...'we are one
		but we're not the same'...sequence prayer for Beate
		Zschaepe - i still believe she was railroaded. in a dream
		with another german i awake partly alarmed by the words
		'grave foundation'...i am going to spend the last day of
		the year with the phantom for park so dam...

		<br>
		2025. so damn happy i picked that so dam film...it was
		magnificent. taking its time with twists and turns then
		bringing it all back home with bang...i made a lipton
		noodle thing a bit concerned over the amount of salt -
		last time it was too much, but i got it so right that
		for the first time ever there were no leftovers in 
		the pot...yum. 
		i don't really have any dream to report, i think i 
		dreamt of one my aunts but i did not retain the facts...
		it's still six in the morning here but i've done
		everything i wanted to do for the day...in terms of
		scales and updating the film list...i have an inclination
		to tidy up the kitchen and should get to that although
		it is no way to kick off the new year...
		let's see how that goes...wednesday huh...
		well, in case anyone cared to know; 
		my guitars of choice are the ibanez roadstar and
		martin acoustic, i have a classical model which 
		have not met and the kramer now on the way...
		my wish ones are the gretsch...i thought maybe
		the nick 13 but it has a drawing on the pick
		guard along with extra letters on the top so
		i crossed that out but still one of the g5s
		is what i'm thinking...then one of the schecter's
		which i like actually for the back of it...
		further away are the reverend flying v and the
		gibson voodoo v...i'm attracted to some eastwood
		models, and finally flaxwood which is a finland
		maker that has nice telecaster types and something
		called laine series...i've had fenders in the
		past but i don't think i am willing to pay for
		one at this point...i like the john 5
		signature series as well the the triplecaster
		put out with jack white but for that kind of money
		i would opt for a 90s bc rich...well i will leave 
		it at that since i find i can easily spend hours simply
		looking at pictures of guitars and if i carry on
		there will be no chance for the kitchen clean up. cheers.

		2 january<br>
		<br>
		i think i might like the deadwood guitar co model
		called the revival yet i hesitate to list it...
		i'd have to see if they provide cases like 
		voodoo custom guitars...the kitchen was more or
		less done except for the dishes in the fridge...
		i got up around midnight wondering if i should
		put place that music man axe i like along with
		the others or even the carry on blackstar which
		has a star on the headstock that reminds me of
		bowie and heineken...uhm the mm is the st vincent
		model...although bilt's ultra zaftig might 
		be a nicer choice...by the way if you are wondering
		how i find certain types; instead of searching
		for a general return of guitar makers - which will
		only bring up the main and cheap brands - you 
		search for guitar makers in a specific location...
		city or state and you will be pleasantly surprised.
		i think i figured out my conflict with the enigmatic
		and arabic scale...i simply have to call the latter
		the byzantine and then it is not so confusing somehow.
		i played the twenty scales, repeating some of them
		a few times for fun and to memorize since i only
		have learned nineteen of them...given that it is
		still the middle of the night i go back to bed -
		in my dream i then awake in apartment 3k...i am
		alone there and worried since other people have
		access...i am thinking of barricading the door
		but then notice belkis cooking a ton of food -
		she is asking me something about rice but i say
		i don't know what to say while wondering how she
		who has never been to new york is there...i take
		out the trash and see skirt by the elevator but
		when i go to pick him up, it's a mirage...should
		i say hologram...hmm...i open the compactor which
		is nearest to three d - there is a wood slab 
		preventing the opening of the shute - i remove the
		slab and see the bearded man that used to live there
		walking away - i notice there are things scattered 
		around this closet like space that i want and start
		to put them into a bag - a handsome woman appears
		with thin lips talking about the movie and i have
		an exact memory of what she means but not when i 
		saw it or if it was with her - now the cat is really
		in the hallway and i chase him inside...i myself
		go in seeing a huge red wok shaped cooker but covered
		and the pot steaming...it is where the fridge should be
		and i awake again as the three o'clock hour nears...
		i have a certainty that father's spirit is in that apartment, 
		the place i called home longer than any other - otherwise
		i can't decipher this scene...or perhaps it is too early
		for critical thinking.
		<br>
		4 january<br>
		very attracted to the gretsch rancher. which made me consider
		acoustic models...however, at this point i'm locked in with
		my martin and the only "popular' models i would consider
		otherwise are the gibsons...i know some people may not
		comprehend the enthusiasm over instruments...like that
		dream - which in reflection i reasoned out via word play,
		ie; kelvis did live a long while in our house and visited
		a few times before that so it might have been about him
		- that is the letters of his name nearly match belkis -
		to clarify without the burden of too much explanation;
		one is a cousin and the other a maid...having not mentioning
		them previously in these notes, i thought it should be stated.
		looking at the image of the radical jabbar, no relation to
		the great kareem abdul, i got goosebumps over the resemblance
		to the man in three d...in an icky way...i feel it's frightful
		and i don't like the way the american year is starting...
		the las vegas truck bomber ?  there's a woman fleshing out
		fearful scenarios in fast words...which is fine, except
		people are listening, some even agreeing...so there's 
		paranoia in the air...i had felt that W and cheney had
		secured the states yet i see now that that might have
		been my immaturity wishing - is there a group intent on
		derailing the return of rightful rule and kennedy...
		ask not what your country can do...at this point i can
		only dot the i over my suspicion. now then, the enthusiasm;
		well it's like this - someone buys a flying v and minutes
		later he starts searching through more pictures of guitars
		and gets into an argument with himself...i will not admit
		openly to him being me, but later i thought about the
		graduation ring...how i wanted a green gem but they all
		said blue...the guitar in question was mint green...a 
		lighter shade than the cadillac green...if it was myself,
		i most likely opted to wait a few months and in terms
		of color, well i was settled on something white or silver.
		i didn't recall any dreams and skipped jotting these
		notes - then last night, i clearly dreamt that a woman
		had positioned herself upon me, she had a woven strip
		of lace lightly lashing out from her mouth as if unraveling,
		reeling downward, naked, she undid my pants and put her
		straddle side on my genitals, when i looked down there
		was a frothing liquid chalk pouring out of her, i was not
		yet erect yet thought i was ejaculating and awoke thinking
		of alexandra and ester who reminds me of alexandra -
		the scene brought to mind the memory of doris scratching
		her eyeball with her nail which i had seen pre-dream
		weeks ago - it always struck me as unusual and i wonder
		why i never asked if her eyeball was itchy...it also
		made me remember the stranger pre-dream of lotta's 
		necklace being drenched in semen...i noticed she 
		stopped wearing it and to some extent made me worry - 
		i think it was some time after frankfurt - i notice
		too a shift in feeling, nearly an absence since xmas.
		it may all of course be my surroundings, even sorrow
		instead of snow...a secret cat fight that i am not
		entirely privvy to - oh the pitfalls of worship...
		long sigh, hmm, so after he gets the flying v he
		thinks to put place a shirley sticker on it...
		we have always lived in the castle...decisions, decisions...
		words i can't ever pronounce right...ennui...
		i read the daemon lover and heard her voice...
		it is near to sylvia plath's tone...
		i re-watched shirley and understood it a bit more...
		i also read her short story paranoia not knowing
		it was unearthed much later...2013...she had
		put it to pen in 1965...feeling  the literary buzz,
		i packed up a few books i wanted to find or finish,
		to keep to the point i will only mention here the
		letters of shirley jackson...i don't expect anything
		as witty as ezra pound or as interesting as william
		burroughs but once i get through hangsaman i expect
		to be pleasantly surprised...uhm hangsaman is the 
		novel she is working on in the film...in terms of 
		my own work, i have only been moved to consider
		a romance story involving carol jean and del lamb -
		going backwards from the end and ending at the
		camelot hotel in tulsa honeymoon after the nixa
		church of christ wedding...mrs lamb passed away
		on the 22nd of december, they were married over
		half a century - of course with all the guitars
		in my thoughts, i don;t expect that a fictional
		version of her story will go further than thought
		for now...i listened to all the available versions
		of deep ellem blues in preparation to record my
		own.
		<br>
		6 january <br>
		<br>
		i get up a quarter past midnight making it nearly
		six in the morning in sweden...i swear it was a
		very strange sunday...i had got up early with
		a dream wherein there was a woman here upon 
		my bed enticing me into making love...there 
		was a cock ring but it was more like a strap
		as the type worn for testitcles i suppose -
		i have the feeling it is rafaelina yet i have
		not heard or thought of her in years...it is
		not exciting as we try two positions and as
		i awake perhaps sensing the oncoming weirdness-
		of course i overthink the matter and it takes
		a couple of hours of contemplation...yet the 
		weather was brilliant, crisp...nearly cold -
		i knew lotta was going back home and viewed
		her glow up video perplexed by her tanning ritual-
		still not as perplexing as ripley which i saw
		almost hating andrew in it yet with a heightened
		sense of emotions as if i somehow identified with
		the character...maybe this was due to the fine
		cinematography...the series is shot in grainy
		greyscale...i watched it for dakota except there
		wasn't enough of her in it...later in the curio
		sunday i watched the watchers which had a lot more
		fanning...anyway the glowy thing took me into the
		noon hour...i felt removed from myself as if one
		walking in a daze...somehow i settled my sexual
		excitement and played through all the scales...
		i did this standing suddenly understanding that
		i don't need to look at the fret in most cases but
		also seeing that at least one of the new ones
		got muddled by not being seated...the cool weather
		made breathing much easier...olives and a sandwich 
		along with the movie...lotta arrived and for a 
		minute there i nearly felt content - well, happy-
		even if i had spent most of the time searching 
		through guitars to buy or not to buy...to bebop
		or to beatnik what is the question...i made a
		wish for a nice time for the actors at the 
		ceremony although i hadn't really thought about
		it since jodi was put up for honors...
		i chose to return to sleep but that was delayed
		by someone yelling outside nearby...i raced to
		reach a point where that sound and its associated
		trauma could not reach me...is it always illegal
		to kill a nuiscance? coffee cigarettes and sprite
		and i went into dreamland especially thanks to lotta -
		well the thought of her which now came with dakota...
		as i thought back to viking days...in my dream i am
		in a hotel intent on saving a girl, she's child like
		and men are bullying her, they even have her naked
		and i manage to manuveur her away...it was then 
		sensual yet in some experimental way as if she were
		a doll or an artificial intelligence embodied...
		we saunter in the escape and reach the railway station 
		- a heavy set man in triplicate surrounds me as i see her
		walk in front and further away - i think of gerard
		but i do not feel small or even skinny as he holds
		my arm, perhaps my shoulders...i only think why are 
		there three of him...i awake but only to snuggle myself
		into further dreams - as i type now i half worry that
		lotta might read these notes and mistake some of the
		thoughts herein for intent...i also wonder if it was
		kelvis that took my assistant commissioner police pin -
		in any case i am glad of taking notice of pre-dreams
		by which i mean those last fading thoughts that don't
		always make sense or even contradict my own ideas...
		i suppose the problem with the day was merely lack
		of restful sleep...hopefully this excursion into
		dream worlds will solve that jigsaw puzzle - in 
		scenes that now fade as if never been, i recall some
		talk of jedi...it's only that i am still getting over
		the irony of such a lovely day without the sounds
		of colmado or avocado fruit vendors still being crashed
		into by some other shouting...well, i was either 
		finally alone in three k or in conversation with lotta
		as my feeling felt a sort of completion...in the struggle
		to recall, there was a moment where something had to be
		paid but i didn't have any cash on me not even my wallet
		when suddenly - i think it was two hundred euros - a
		woman pulls out a stack of what must have been ten or
		twenty thousand euros and peels away a couple of the 
		bills put placing them on the counter to my astonishment.
		maybe it was three hundred since that would match
		with the earlier fat man frenzy...the driver carries no
		cash - i now have this stash of guitar price knowledge...
		i believe i am done searching but i would never have
		guessed how addictive well that is not the right word,
		how entertaining it is for me to look at electric
		guitars...i nearly want to have another look at only
		lovers left alive, but having seen it a couple of times
		already i can play and pause it right in my mind's eye.
		yeah funnel of love could be the soundtrack for scrolling
		through the six string instruments.
		<br>
		december 8<br>
		<br>
		bowie sarah polley elvis day and it seems i was never told
		it was also kreiger and bassey day...a minute ago i was
		thinking of the mistaken lilia instead of my lilia as it
		is also her day...and how the date came to hold meaning
		for me in the first place...nora makes james spill the
		goods...i didn't dream yesterday and today i dreamt so
		clearly of emilee dressing and kissing me that i thought
		i was not dreaming - of course lotta's middle name is 
		emilie and when i awoke i had to confront myself with
		a sort of weighing the matter...i ate most of an orange
		with sugar right away...do i say to me that miss grant
		is calling me or that snowbound lotta's name creates
		this irony...most ironic was pig, as the vice president
		of the nick cage south american fan club, although
		i should be promoted, the film is extremely informative
		if one cares to pay attention...i wasn't in the right
		mind set...the swine's face reminded me of alexandra
		and she is interested in acting but it was the only time
		i felt that except when i used to hang out with a 
		sibling of some narcotic agent...to think of it now he
		died in a car crash and she had a close call driving
		recently...i write it extemporanously and with the hope
		that it voids future incidents when she is at the wheel...
		so portland is three hundred years overdue for the thing
		i will not mention...whoa, nell has not posted in a year,
		i do hope no one has put placed a pony up daddy saddle
		on her...nicole mentioned woman under the influence and
		although i myself dislike boxd-letter, i went to see it.
		the line "i'm not a spaghetti man" sticks with me somehow.
		i couldnt get the right voice and speed to enjoy hangsaman as
		an audio book so i eyeballed it which is much faster yet
		actually slower given my inclination to postpone or procrastinate
		not to mention the natural distractions that occur when it is
		not an actual paperback or hardcover...or it could be that i
		yet feel the white goddess was not entirely learnt...no, not
		as intense as finnegan's wake yet i want to gain as many
		details as i might...still, life keeps moving like a wildfire
		consuming the spaces with red hot burning replacements...
		so as to even make social media scrolling logical to some
		extent...i found it highly interesting that jean-marie passed
		away on the day i failed to secure the agspalding pen i 
		wanted when the topic came up as i forgot my own notion
		of waiting to get it later on...i did get a waterman which
		was on sale...i believe they are french, no less...i believe
		i like mr magoo but i have no clue how he came up in conversation
		with mother...she liked the clip but i was told she did not
		have patience for the film...i thought it was wonderful...
		1001 arabian nights - actually an ancestor; abdul aziz magoo
		sells lamps and his lazy nephew is aladdin...i mean come on
		there are even three little maids from damascus...
		to circle back to the thin white duke, aladdin sane not
		only had the jean genie but also panic in detroit...the
		lions have me expecting them to go all the way after the
		pounding they gave minnesota last sunday...i am trying to
		keep calm...anyway i picked out the format for deep elem
		and plucked through a few ideas but i don't seem to be in 
		a hurry about it. i suppose you could see that as confidence
		or an addiction to hesitation. happy birthday, everyone.
		nobody should feel so crowded with things to do...i run
		through the ideas (shave, clean kitchen, make a meal,
		receive the incoming delivery...groceries, take a bath,
		give up on the idea of fender and esp guitars, well, 
		perhaps not some vintage models, scale ritual, start
		the recording process for that blues song i want to
		cover, update film list, take care of skirt, call mother, and avoid 
		the news while hoping los angeles makes it through
		what can only be called a walking inferno) of course
		instead i avidly search the news and then take a nap...
		pre dream i felt no stability as if a face dance...
		at least they were faces i liked...it's too bad no
		beautiful girl ever feels as pretty as they look - 
		mostly they think it is make up or that their lips
		are too thin or something...suddenly i am excited
		to be asleep...i was fully expecting to see lotta's
		mother as she had been on my mind upon waking but i
		was actually in some european town...like portugal
		i imagine or some hybrid place further north...
		there is a girl that approaches me, somehow she
		knows i am thinking of lotta, oh she's cheating on
		you, i don't say anything and continue sauntering
		until i see her at a dead end street leaning against 
		a silvery grey wall with some guy i do not know and
		i near ironically looking at him not her and i say
	        not what i am thinking meaning he is wearing feathery
		earrings going in fact for a compliment and then walking
		away without speaking to her reaching the corner there
		is an alleyway the type one finds in chinatown places
		where a woman in the type of hat which would be more
		akin to the 1930s or 1940s although less so floats
		into the walkway upon which  point i decide to follow
		the anachronism and also to run yet halfway into my getaway
		lotta is holding on to me and then drags me into some type
		of mall that i can only describe as modern wherein she
		seems intent on proving herself to me...she keeps repeating
		that she wants to be there because they are giving away
		something or other - the last word i saw her use was lustig
		- it had that sound but it was another word - i do not ask
		what she means possibly still annoyed at her being with the
		bloke with the earrings - i notice an extended family and
		a baby - i ask to experience the scene with me which she does
		and it does not feel weird to sort of snuggle inbetween these
		fat women looking down at the child - there are to older children
		next to me and i ask about the kid's name, his name is neptune
		you should say hi to him with his name, i step over to where
		lotta is and see that in the meanwhile they have given her coffee
		and i go along with the hello instructions and the baby waves
		as if he really likes his name and then lotta leads me to 
		a cafe but its one without seats so we go horizantal into
		one of the booths laying down me first then her in front of
		the waitress who immediately settles down a very fine and crisp
		looking salad so i suppose the word meant salad - salat, feldsalat,
		not certain yet i take a close look at the waitress as i write
		this now i want to say julia stiles yet the character was more
		like ginnifer goodwin - in contrast to the guy i actually can't
		memorize her face as i notice her undoing the lace of her collar
		well choker i think they call them above a very sheer uniform
		blouse that was sorely in need of a bra as the sight of nipples
		and petite breasts once again made me realize that indeed for 
		men titties are like the sun then awaking feeling nearer 
		than ever to lotta yet not exactly sure what the dream meant 
		or if the lettuce was any good - i thought later perhaps it 
		meant that she has the notion that those are the type men like
		or something...although i don't think she is insecure and so i 
		won't augment the thought with adding words about her cuteness
		besides what if there is or was an affair...or even the 
		manipulation of emotion to provoke my jealousy after i put 
		placed westsofia77's project on the home page...who knows,
		i do know it is next to impossible to balance the likes and
		loves...usually i dive deep into the situation and neglect
		everything else save for coffee and cigarettes, yet now
		i am reluctant to give in to expectations or jump to conclusions,
		much less make demands or disregard all the whatever it is i 
		need to get done and so it goes.
		<br>
		january 9<br>
		<br>
		correction like the sun...for myself it would be like the rain.
		on second thought the waitress might have been india...
		that would make sense...i felt a sort of magic or synchronicity
		in the list as i placed shanghai express after phantom as it
		was the film playing in the fictional movie house...i had an
		entirely different idea for what would follow yet i could not
		find it and obviously this way even makes more sense - i also
		viewed that film again - noticing the peiping sign and the 
		watch, a flintridge...it has a flip cover which one can still
		get yet it has become an uncommon style...anyway it isn't a
		movie about writers yet there are several written messages
		which qualifies it for the list...after having only soup and
		bread, the big meal made me sluggish...so much so that leaning
		into the twenty scale ritual i was surprised - pleasantly, 
		at my own enthusiasm which i suppose was enhanced by now
		feeling i got them down...i found out leighton was one of
		the victims of the wildfires, well her house, but the 
		knowledge came along with finding out she was married and
		has a couple of children...so in rifling through memory
		the emotions were varied as if they wanted to contradict
		themselves...what i think now or wonder is if she still
		writes music...there was not much music in my mind save
		for a zorn tune...zip, why is it zip code...hmm...gotta
		look that up...questions i never asked...quickly i 
		embraced the idea of lotta in pre-dream as i pondered
		over dean and schecter guitars...you gotta see the
		eastwood guitars tiktok...extremely entertaining if
		you like me like simply looking at guitars...the guy
		from bizarre reno is also cool although he seems a 
		bit too enchanted by old fenders and gibsons...
		seen the maestro series...but everyone says they are
		not worth it...now then dreams...two men stood by
		a truck, one peeing into mid-air as if trying to 
		wet a woman standing across from him...this again
		was a scene in which i felt i was a viewer instead
		of a participant to some extent - as the truck pulls
		away, i see that lilia is in the back, i call to her
		to get out of the truck as it speeds away...i kept
		dreaming easier locations and sensations mostly
		with lotta who got some of the snow cleared...
		anyway none of these moments, perhaps for being so
		casual kept themselves in the waking mind...i did
		think how hard it must be for her to work through
		the fine line of being herself while fencing off
		the once in a while weird multitudes wanting her
		to be something else...i suppose models and actresses
		might relate to being in that positions - as i awoke,
		the scene had me facing a very powerful woman, i 
		thought it might be an actress but that may only have
		been due to the fact that i love cinema so...anyway
		entirely different from my jean harlow silk dream,
		here the woman was adamant - there's nobody like me
		that will make you feel so fine, or was it good...
		and there i was under a spell of sorts even bowing
		down the way one does when knighted by royalty...
		except my penis was gushing pee through the erection
		as if the entire evening was scripted or someone
		was trying to make me wet the bed...yet aside from
		the number one, i felt there was some truth in it
		that was told therein...i don't know who she might
		be however...i know that i mentioned some pre-dream
		similar to all this and perhaps someone reading it
		was making it out to be what i never intended...i 
		mean yes i did "see" that but i remember carlos
		cracked up on cocaine as we stood at west end 
		urinals suddenly turning to me and peeing on the
		lower part of my right leg...so i don;t think any
		one wants to be peed on and i certainly don't
		want to pee on nobody...the pre dawn air is cool
		i can hear jim singing 'passion lady give up your
		vows...save our city ah right now'...i'm not having
		an ale but i am already high on love...very much
		so...meaning i adore me and i like exploring that
		self adoration with lotta even in times when i 
		cannot recall what the dream said.

	      9 january<br>
	</br>
		i somehow stumble dream into a department store yet i cannot find
		the right exit, wandering around a woman with thick legs
		grabs me as if a friend then we dance - i can feel her 
		press against me as if teasing the penis resting at her
		thigh - she seems to know that i am trying to get somewhere,
		to get home and we walk out of the place into an avenue
		of darkness, she is walking ahead of me, heading to her car
		and i am asking if she is really going to give me a ride
		when unlocking the door with a guffaw she slides into
		the vehicle leaving me without a clue as to where i am or
		how to get home - i remember asking someone at the shop
		which is the exit that leads to bella vista...a scene
		later said some sort of argument with a man insisting on
		something or other yet somehow wound up with a ruined
		right foot, his valet stopping their ride in its track
		as he howled in pain, getting out and flicking away
		the two remaining toes onto the road carelessly...i
		wake up wondering how i can see this or why i am
		interacting with people that don't like me and i 
		surely don't like...i get up and adjust the los angeles
		lament a bit, thinking i wrote it too hurriedly and it
		could be improved somehow even if i know the main point
		must hit the emotional place no one wants to speak of
		like a bolt of lightning...i hope its quiet today
		as the intrusive talk disrupted my inclination to 
		record...i suppose wearing headphones to get through
		my own kitchen experience would do it otherwise -
		maybe these dreams bordering on nightmare reflect
		how rattled those loudspeakers and locals, as if timed
		to detonate a word or two into the air as i stand
		by the fridge, make me feel. you see i want to think
		of the song not them...in the worst case scenario, 
		a muse or even myself in order to flesh out something
		beyond this time and this place. ps, pre dream very
		clear thought of ive fang this from memory handing
		each other notes while i learned some chinese...
		let us call it nostalgia - no sense in next dream
		strolling what can only be washington heights -
		a man is trying to tell me about some politician
		that admires the police - i don't stop but glance
		at the nightmare image of three men dressed up
		like halloween cops - i can't help but voice the
		fact of their corruption...dominicans! finding
		a train station i am as if in a sequel to previous
		dream trying to get home except now to manhattan -
		i get on a train slowly with some guy that keeps
		talking - get in, get in, he says - it is not like
		the mta, in fact like a rollercoaster with an iron
		belt strap holding the passengers in place - 
		there are two other guys in the front seat and
		and a blurry figure directly behind so three rows
		and this contraption is going to brooklyn and i am
		asking what the stop is, brubaker? can i then transfer
		back to a wagon to the city...the answer is vague,
		the guys are in argument. i have no idea who they 
		are and awake baffled especially since like the 
		buses in rome one simply gets on without the process
		of payment, if i recall it was sort of an honor system
		in italy...but to someone from new york that means
		a free ride...weird to think of that now. 
		<br>
		11 january<br>
		<br>
		well in reality not so weird, if i was thinking of
		home, it would make sense as i felt at home in rome.
		my dreams exploded into psychodelic vision the type
		one might experience only with drugs or during a
		fight except being hit in the eye is not as colorful
		where the expression seeing stars originates...
		after that all the scenes were easier yet nothing
		i suppose remarkable enough to linger into waking -
		i guess i was too excited over finally recording
		deep elem blues...i did an electric version which
		i still liked after listening to it a few times -
		even if i feel the chorus vocal needs to be doubled
		and the fact that it went over five minutes...i 
		did that on an empty stomach and then after a light
		meal i recorded a different version of the same 
		song using the acoustic but this take was haunted
		by someone mentioning a now political singer-songwriter,
		strange how that happens - so i struggled even with 
		the words as if distracted although i've been studying
		them and even wrote them down...anyway no excuses, that
		second take was still good but far from great except
		for the way i turned the chord changes...making it a
		seventh e then a bent e on the fourth fret resolving 
		into the regular e major on the verses...the vocal was
		awful in failing to be mindful of the words and again
		over five minutes...i decided to give the shelton brothers
		version another listen since i based it on them...ah,
		no break between the verse and chorus gets you a three
		minute song...still, for only having done the scale ritual
		in recent weeks or even months, i felt pretty pleased at
		the results...i could nearly understand why the beatles
		recorded dozens of takes...not that i am going in that
		direction...yet all this is tempered by the knowledge
		of the massive destruction in california...the press
		reports the death of sam from sam & dave...i listen
		to hold on i'm coming, a tune impossible to dislike -
		but then the thing that makes most sense to hear at
		a time like this is the alabama five woke up this
		morning soprano theme song...i hear a few more songs
		that are "suggested" on yt...put placing this pen 
		into actions evident here...it is yet very early in
		the day and hopefully i will get at least a third
		take of the cover i'm working on...

		      14 january<br>

	when i got around to mixing the deep elem tracks i realized
	why it sometimes takes me a while to play around with the daw -
	or even why at other times i rush through the process of song
	production...it's like an added step which requires an entirely
	different talent and disposition...neither of which are easy 
	for me - like editing a book after the writing is done...
	since there are several live takes, which leaves nothing much in
	terms of mastering - given that it is all on one track, this
	conundrum was eased - although i did not expect to do it all
	in two days...much less to get a couple of tracks i really 
	like...the only thing i didn't do was record videos for these,
	instead opting to put place scenes from the white hell of 
	pitz palu on each song...always thought leni was a director
	but you can see her acting in that...	   
	i simply felt a bit too disheveled and further could not 
	decide on a location...although i do have a room that 
	could be nice for filming...anyway presenting it this
	way feels cooler, even quirky...my only real trouble 
	came using the open e tuning for one take which took me
	about twelve attempts to find a groove that would mesh
	with the vocal i had in mind...i did not have it in mind
	to put place them here, however, when i went to upload
	from laptop to phone, the cord did not respond except 
	to see itself as charging which led me to upload them
	thisaway for access at video editing - well, enough 
	notes on deep elem - i am a bit further into hangsaman
	and have watched this is the night -bj, "before javeline"
	and learned a bit about thelma todd - i also viewed the
	wisdom of crocodiles - sometimes called immortality and
	was pretty impressed, especially by timothy's performance -
	even if the antagonist thugs were overplayed...
	otherwise not much to report in terms of dreams - 
	i'm certain of dreaming of lotta last night yet in
	such a casual way that there is only a glimpse memory
	remaining - yesterday dreaming of walking into a 
	magazine shop on the upper west side - for some reason
	handing the man there my backpack - i was thinking i 
	had four dollars yet i am not sure what i wanted to buy -
	i awoke wondering if it was about the brim screenplay
	or the two dollar bill i had used there once upon a time -
	afternoon ordering water, i was actually sent extra money and
	phoned back to return it - a few minutes later i decided
	to review my other phone and found a letter from mike -
	it had been a while and brought up some recollections i
	had not entertained or considered previously - specifically
	about another timothy...oh my rock star friends...it was
	mr wright that gave me a lesson about rasputin by way of
	maria's book. meanwhile a lot of talk about tiktok, there
	is one protest clip displaying the united states blowing
	itself up...so china can't have it...i feel awful for the
	american creators living under a system that does not respect
	their freedom in that sense...how nice is it to earn a decent
	wage doing something you actually enjoy, i saw one girl was
	even able to purchase a house...to speak of this naturally
	leads to politics, i know the kremlin took similar actions
	even if i feel this now proves my point about there being
	more freedom in moscow than washington - especially in the
	sense that what they want is to own that platform...now
	the viral jealousy sound seems eerily prophetic, if i can't
	have you; no one can...so the stolen election that started
	with wuhan kiev ends with bytedancing wildfires. ps, 
	yes justine it was disaster tourism when they alerted the
	press for photo-ops, drove an hour and a half to spend
	a whopping fifteen minutes showing their hats...i felt
	physically upset until paris stood up for displaced cats
	and even adopted a dog, like burroughs said you can't fake
	quality like you can't fake a good meal. 

		      <br>
		      15 january<br>
		      <br>
	i feel like the spirit of wsb summoned queer and i am
	terribly excited to see how the film fleshed out the 
	novel...i re-read that opening chapter a few weeks ago
	when i made one of the writing processors you can find
	here in this domain, there are others at inkrealm.info
	- because when i first read it what stayed was me was
	the note he made a prefix in which he detailed his
	feelings about joan vollmer...possession, to many is
	not a viable truth yet like in the shirley jackson story,
	where i easily related it as factual, i see now that
	i missed that point or rather did not connect my 
	experiences with that word - indeed, possession is 
	not only a viable truth, i tell you i have seen it
        happen. i do not mean in the catholic exorcism way,
	although others have seen that...yet none of this is
	what i actually wanted to jot but i suppose my thrill
	at getting to see this movie overtakes me...i wanted
	to take another dig at the publicity seeking former
	royals who somehow keep using and are still named
	as if HRH when they are not. hell the queen may her
	soul rest in peace even revoked their cottage she
	was so upset...perhaps south east england is now
	montecito...the duke and duchess of montecito, i mean
	if the press is going to keep playing along why not go
	all the way - this rant is tempered by the fact that
	i noticed the media kicking the not so dynamic duo
	of biden harris and i don't want to come off as a bully -
	or appear to partake in persecution even if justified. 
	so i won't "say" more at this juncture - now then, this
	brings to mind how crushed paris was while thinking 
	she could never be a princess...yet now, clearly,
	if anyone can claim the title of american royalty -
	it is her...in a quiet and effective manner she managed
	to raise eight hundred thousand dollars and counting
	in mere minutes...of course, this might be due to the
	fact of her malibu home on top of her rv trailer incident,
	but i can;t see any selfishness in her fundraising and
	much less in her caring for pets all the while being a
	loving mother although ms hilton i do think you are going
	to spoil them kids...ahem. yes i am done kissing ass,
	i viewed spread, more for the list and keitel than anything-
	it had this very strange butt licking thing, a mediocre
	movie with a few good lines...i know iknow comedy is hard...
	somehow the last two days the scales became hard...well two
	of twenty...a couple of them somehow got jumbled in my head
	where surely the melodic was being called the minor in the
	bebop notes and as i noticed it it took some of the edge off
	my confidence, luckily i am pretty sure i won't have to speak
	about scales to anyone...i saw that ozzy is now in the hall of
	fame and did a bit of celebration via reposting but with
	the concern that  rhoads got the guitar award '81 only
	months before his passing '82 and this thing was '24 and
	hopefully he will not be in danger in '25 if you see my 
	logic although i suppose we are all in danger and him 
	moreso regardless of awards...like the pope, it's a focus
	point that people fixate on or as dylan put placed it,
	people can kill you with kindness...fame leaves few
	hiding places, hmm bowie put it concisely; what you need
	you have to borrow...i can't borrow the guitars i want
	but last night that was what i was dreaming of, electric
	instruments...still only a glimpse-memory as i awoke 
	tormented by a nagging pain for the second day in a row -
	the time before it felt like my calf was being twisted -
	lower back as if all those tumblr ads had gone to work
	on a subconscious level, too bizarre well like possession...
	to come full circle in the note - it's as if someone is
	trying to go to sleep within me thus awaking me painfully -
	who knows - uhm i felt fine as i pondered the matter and
	fed the cat, so fine i went back to sleep and dreamt i 
	owned some sort of cafe bar with suze, the place had two
	rooms, it was not crowded and i asked her to take my
	things...wallet, watch, hmm, there were two wallets...
	well she took these things into the other room, a sort
	of private office slash vip area...i was taking care of
	the front when this rude woman tried to rush past me
	to gain access to where she was...i lifted a small white
	statue to her face and ended the invasion then i went
	in for some reason asking her for my wallet, she handed
	me the zara but i said i wanted the valentino and then
	we seemed to trade places as i stayed in that room and
	she made her way to the front - the doors were swinging
	types and before she could exit she was confronted by
	several men, surrounded, attacked - i ran and tried to
	pry the one behind her off her by the mouth but then 
	thought the eyes and started clawing into one of his 
	eyes with my right hand while pulling him away with my
	left hand...all pretty intense and i awoke hoping no
	woman i knew would be wounded in this way and that
	i would not know the feeling of pushing a man's eye
	away from the socket...for a minute it all felt like
	an alternate reality...as if married and running a
	mom and pop shop...she loved that guthrie kid tale
	about how people get hitched, i can't recall it but
	it was something about the man simply putting a 
	a ring on the woman's finger...i never called nobody
	as much as i phoned her over the hills and far away...
	william shot joan, a peeper sized hole in the forehead, 
	i believe his story but it troubles me that her child who was there
	is hardly ever mentioned - either to protect her,
	or more likely to not complicate matters further
	in the face of tragedy...this is one aspect i 
	am intent on seeing addressed in the film.

	<br>

		      16 january<br>
		      <br>

		i have always loved the word juxtaposition...it felt
		foreign and i could never imagine it in the mouth of
		some old-timer...much less a foreigner. 
		thursday. so it was wednesday when i watched queer.
		i was enjoying the opening, not so much the font, 
		until i heard sinead oconner singing all apologies -
		that is a nirvana tune, naturally i started thinking
		of william meeting kurt and how sad it was for music
		that her voice although immortal will not make new
		songs...these thoughts along with a slight concern
	        over a grocery delivery which i expected to arrive
		between eight and eleven - it came about ten thirty -
		or as the film left the caverns of ecuador - went 
	        through me along with a suspicion that the soundtrack
		would be too distracting...don't get me wrong, the
		songs were mostly good except the sort of hyped up
		ending 'how can..' thing which has burroughs' name 
		stapled on it without his exact consent - contrary
		to what may seem a negative review allow me to preface
		these scribbles by saying i have rarely wanted to enjoy
		a film as much as i did this one - given that i admire
		wsb's writing greatly...and this is a great film with
		unexpected and wonderful acting by the lead, mr craig.
		yet before we are allowed to vibe at his electricity,
		there is 'come as you are' like a music video complete
		with rooster fighting sounds as the protagonist catches
		sight of what turns out to be both a supporting player 
		and the antagonist unless you consider drug use in that
		category instead - but i didn't want to judge this like
		that in fact the fact that it made me think of things
		external to daniel or william should have told me what
		i am about to divulge; well implore, please remake this
		with a proper soundtrack! not only does it step on the
		actor's toes but it tramples over el hombre invisible -
		watch it and see how the next song - some low rumble 
		jazz leaves you wondering about the meaning of "segue" in 
		the next scene which they used for the trailer...transition
		might be more apt - re; segue...
		before all this - i should have mentioned the starting
		credits serve as a catalyst to the confusion i have 
		underlined...lowery's under the volcano next to rimbaud's
		a season in hell...might even make some viewers pause
		to read both books before proceeding...camel cigarettes
		are all over the place - in those opening credits they
		lay next to raleigh cigarettes...although he gave up
		smoking, in the 1990s he was fond of kamel menthols
		which i guess is where they came up with camels...
		burroughs smoked old gold, lucky strikes, benson&hedges,
		      english ovals, and senior service...of course 
		marijuana but that is not to the point...
	        more to the point are the guns, a clip line of ten
		handguns curls into seven; mauser, derringer, star model b or beretta, 
		      a colt, amadeo rossi, norinco, harrington or foehl & weeks,
		the fire arm of the famed incident was the star .380 automatic
		but the tragedy itself is not only overlooked but disguised
		as if he had shot the supporting player/antagonist well at least
		in a lynchian lifted type dream sequence time lapse which winds up
		making us look at the man in the aforementioned 90s without
		the novelty camel smokes - a bit before - to not lose the
		lack of logic in the soundtrack - a french or italian pop
		song sprinkles itself mysteriously as daniel/william falls
		to earth from the sky and saunters back to chips ahoy...
		the absence of mexico in all this is a spectacular form
		of writing, we never feel mexico city and much less quito -
		quitting for a minute to grab the goods from the door and
		put things here and there i thought well my soup was pretty
		good and daniel is shockingly good even if too fat to play
		bill - well, not fat - stocky - yes too strong physically
		even during withdrawal we already sense he will pull through-
		i watched the ending positively hating the final song but
		said to myself take a another look and listen tomorrow,
		sleep on it...and so i did, it only got worse. i awoke 
		and went through guitar scales...a string popped and 
		i found there two very troubled screws living in the 
		ibanez roadstar ii - rusty and refusing any sort of twist
		or turn...i had to put place most of the strings back 
		again carefully and i nearly cried after - i suppose
		the sense of tears was also weeping over this great
		and interesting film which in fact even hinted at the
		irony of joan's child by way of a kid at the bottom
		of the stairs and yes i did catch the william tell
		sofa playing in the party overdose trip...crying
		because the soundtrack sucked harder than the
		homosexual scenes - wilder than i expected but also
		lessened by this intrusive soundtrack, like i said,
		a lot of good songs but in the wrong place, dr john
		might have shaped some if best with 'right place wrong
		time' - i am well aware of the amount of work and love
		that goes into something like this and of how careless
		this note might come off as, but why should i lie about
		how i feel except to myself and in fantasy where i
		could convince myself that jean harlow is embracing me - 
		indeed, i expect anyone actually reading this demands
		my truth in a sense and so it goes...off the top of my
		head i think an entire bowie soundtrack would have
		worked if the point was to please the mtv and social
		media scroll crowds along with having it be someone he
		had some interaction with...when time magazine tells
		you why it is a grand statement with explanations then
		you know something is wrong and for me it was the tunes. 
		how i wish this was not the case. now then to further
		juxtapose; hollywoodland by two skinny girls should
		be released any minute now, well re-released...
		      which i will now dedicate to someone with
		      several perfect soundtracks, david lynch,
		      not to mention a goodly record of his own.
		      they are saying he is dead but they are
		      wrong, lynch is not dead because lynch is
		      immortal!

		      <br>
		      it made sense, to me, to watch hoodlum empire
		on the heels of kraven the hunter and i sort of got
		a kick out of both...still, friday was an awful
		day which did not improve until i put it to bed -
		lotta had said she hated sitting around the apartment
		all the time and that is coherent yet it is also
		the opposite of how i feel...very much enjoying
		the confines of my place which even make me wonder
		how anyone can manage to live in much larger spaces
		as i often find myself wishing there were less rooms
		that being in terms of cleaning - in terms of dreams
		i had one vague scene in aunt's house...i remember
		it sort of turned or transformed into a shop but 
		the details escape - kind of like being in the
		inconsistent thoughts of the girl from hangsaman...
		a bit of inconsistancy with the guitar scales -
		i suppose it is due to being stubborn - as once
		i believe it learnt i don't check to see if i am
		right...how can an egomaniac be wrong...well as
		it happened with one suspended scale which i didn't
		catch until weeks later, i made it a point to get
		these errors corrected and i am pretty confident that
		i won't mix up the enigmatic with the byzantine
		unless i start calling it arabic again...the new
		ones, voodoo and bali, also get a bit mixed up in
		my mind but repetition of their patterns is now
		catching up to automatic memory...in fact, i felt
		so good about it, i started learning another bebop
		scale in order to know the complete versions...
		in dreams, i saw guitars, one was very nice yet
		i could not find it as i walked between rooms 
		encountering a dusty left handed strat which i
		am actually curious to attempt if only to see
		how it feels to have the knobs nearer to the wrist -
		in the dream there was a bizarre typewriter with
		cash register keys in the middle which was atop
		a blue metal case ibm hard drive seemingly - i;ve
		not seen anything like it as it is not like any
		existing model although a bit like the ancient 
		manual typewriters in terms of size - i should
		report that i was able to - with kitchen knife
		      and tweezers - to untangle the remaining
		stuck screw from the ibanez which gives me a 
		bit more freedom in terms of the pluck or strum
		which i have on purpose kept from being too intense
		so as not have to purchase new strings - exhausted
		from this process i left the old strings on there -
		it does not sound great, the mismatched ernie balls
		but it's good enough to run through the twenty scale
		ritual - now in mentioning these things i do not mean
		to imply mastery of my instrument in fact more correctly
		lack of expertise...even if i do not feel that way when
		playing something familiar or improvising upon it. my
                favorite new song is an archaic thing called 'i've
		got a feeling i'm falling' - annette hanshaw...1929,
		or thereabouts...it thrills me.
		      <br>
		      <br>
		      19 january<br>
		      <br>
		      "did you ever have a dream that you couldn;t
		explain...ever met your accusers face to face in the rain..."
		i used to think of that song alot - not to learn chords
		or words, but it stuck around my mind after i learnt
		the words...i bring it up as a point of irony - as i
		never tried to play it or even play along to it...
		maybe it was the references to milton and dante at
		the start...i don't recall the start of this dream,
		i found myself in a shop as if part of a group that
		was looting the place...i remember scattered pens
		adorning the floor near the counter by the exit -
		i might hve been thinking how strange it was that
		shirley jackson used the ellipses alot in hangsaman...
		it sort of made me feel justified in terms of myself
		employing them...but enough to join marauders and trash
		a place in a dream? hmm...perhaps...outside it was still
		light but the grey light that is nowhere near bright -
		i had a delay getting a german film entitled 'hotel', which
		i am viewing now, and watched 'the trust' which exceeds
		irony on several levels...we are getting into a car -
		a silver only slightly brighter than the asphalt, a station
		wagon but one of the guys begins to argue with me - not
		certain what it was about - he pulls out a knife and starts
		to do that sort of dance knife wielders do who have no 
		training in martial arts - i do not think of defending
		myself except to say something about the logic of simply
		getting away and leaving the violent discussion for later -
		in memory i turn away and into the vehicle as he charges
		then shift away from his reckless plunge leading him into
		the car and then getting in myself but that might be a 
		fictional version of the dream as i am pretty certain i
		awoke before turning...awaking, i look at the time, i 
		make coffee, i let a few cigarettes smoke, i think of
	        lotta and update domains, then weaving through headlines
		i find "man stabbed to death, teen wounded on lower east
		side outside movie theater' -there are, it seems, ten
		films playing in that house; the goonies, one of them
		days, wolf man, den of thieves, the last show girl,
		a complete unknown, babygirl, nosferatu, mufasa, the
		brutalist, nickel boys, september 5, anora, and 
		wicked...a couple of tickets cost about thirty dollars.
		(there is no charge to get punctured by knife
		or to hold it in a deadly grip even if amazon
		will not deliver blades to the new york area)
		i'd only watch the kidman film and the anderson movie. 
		i'd been thinking that the literal translation of the
		others in german is die anderen although they say
		it was called unknown, unbekannt...sorry tiktok isnt
		available right now...close app! one nation under a 
		groove, but since most folks don't go to church on
		sunday no more i hear service is being restored...
		i returned to sleep actually dreaming of myself in
		a surprised mirror as if searching for my face by
		lifting and pulling my hair back...sometimes one
		even forgets that beauty comes from within...lotta
		made pasta. i played the scale ritual and plan to 
		give it another go before going back to the deep
		woods of the austrian alps in 'hotel'...ps, Detroit's
	        nearly perfect season came to an end when a wide
		receiver threw a pass to a running back under double
		coverage as they trailed by ten in the fourth quarter.
		there is nothing to say except thanks anyway and
		hope somehow those fans that paid two thousand for
		a seat ticket get a refund. man woman or teen i
		really thought they could take it this year. well,
		now one is left to cheer only for a chief's defeat.
		 <br>
		      <br>
		      20 jan<br>
		      <br>
		      to conclude the string point; if memory serves
		the nearest place to get them here ran about double
		the cost, that was about seven hundred pesos...but i
		am speaking of years ago...as i
		search now i see regular slinky's advertised for over
		fifteen hundred pesos - uhm well over twenty dollars...
		so you understand it's not the five dollars we are 
		used to paying...there might be less expensive options
		but even so in taking a cab it would not add up to be
		careless in that sense...
		and yes i could get b and high e string by themselves
		but usually not the same brand and i imagine the sound
		quality would suffer...lastly, i have purchased no
		acoustic strings in a while going for the electric
		variety on the martin...i really liked the ring of
		fender bullets but i only found those onetime...my
		choice is dean markley bronze which i have never seen
		here...in case anyone wondered -
		after a long and convoluted conversation with mother
		and sister i got curious over a certain porn but when i skipped
		through it i thought it more horrific than anything
		and not only did it derail my goal of research but
		also it felt like i was witnessing a murder - even
		if it has become commonplace with onlyfans and such -
		i can't see that girl being taken seriously, it was
		as if she was turned into a triviality, a ghost
		that would itself be haunted. later i thought too, 
		the man involved -who showed his face- has limited
	        himself in unimaginable ways...obviously politics
		would be out of the question et cetera, a type of
		social suicide and for what? there is not that much
		money in that business...well, there is some but
		that type of content has become so readily available
		that mostly it is done in part to maintain the patriarchy
		and in part to have incel parties or something like that...
		anyway this demostrates the appointment in samarra story
		irony as in trying to escape my careless talk i only
		found a greater annoyance...somehow i did duck out
		from both bizarre ponds and got to sleep although much
		later than i wanted or expected...therein i thought not
		of strings or conversations or horrid vulgarity...in fact
		i was in my room a lot more colorful than i recall -
		i seemed to be joking with myself about going to a 
		school as a teacher or as a student and so picking out
		the outfit when suddenly i wanted to cut class, yes no
		backpack to take lessons and no tweed blazer to give
		a lecture yet i feeling so confident over this unusual
		ability of being either or...the phone rang, faculty
		insisting that i not be late for my class, hmm so it
		was a lecture day and so i would not be free unless,
                i thought, i gave up both roles and kept this recurring
		dream as a personal treasure for memory as it was now
		for some reason revealing itself to me so much so the
		self-jape felt entertaining - some people did not
		find 'hotel' entertaining but right at the end i knew
		it as if i had written it - i understood the mystery
		as if by instinct, as if there could be no other way 
		to write that ending. i've only felt that way once 
		before while viewing an atom egoyan movie and that
		was nearly dejavu in some sense except i had not seen
		it before...to think there will only be a very limited
		amount of new david lynch projects is truly sad, sadder
		than cheap ass porn. william s burroughs wrote something
		about this pen occupation like simply doing his homework.
		i think it was in a book entitled the job. perhaps, that
		was the catalyst of those learning dream scenes...ps,
		i wanted to underline something about guitar scales,
		i mostly do them as a way of honoring jerry garcia...
		by mentioning them i do not mean to recommend the
		ritual since everyone has their own method...chords,
		knowing chords should be sufficient knowledge to 
		work out notes for leads and i found this to be very true and
		to some extent easier...i know a lot of guitarists
		simplify the scales by only using a box shape and
		i mention this hoping to clarify my position...sometimes
		i will admit that the extra knowledge helps yet all
		one has to do is review how many players breathed
		genius without knowing how to read music and often
		enough without any idea of scales or as i often 
		put placed it; there are only essentially seven notes.
		      	      <br>
		      <br>
		      21 jan<br>
		      <br>
		i didn't imagine it like soft porn, yet that is
		what the rom com 'lick' was...yet nearly good...
		but to add a note upon yesterday's thought, in
		trying to avoid the hoopla over inauguration,
		hoping they get down to business, i came across
		a clip of bo diddly playing bo diddly...
		now neither you nor i could count the songs
		that draw from that rhythm...i bring it up since it
		demonstrates perfectly the idea of only needing chords-
		so let us say it is in the key of E or C sharp minor,
		some say it is in G and maybe buddy holly played
		it in A with a jazzier turn...makes no difference 
		as the one prevailing chord rings through it and 
		the solo is merely sliding that self same chord up 
		      an octave...somehow it all works in fact 
		      wonderfully which is why so many other
		songs take up that groove...
		      so if anyone tries to convince you that
		you need this or that well basically you don't as
		the one chord song proves itself and it is not
		alone in that category...
		i got halfway through hangsaman and went to sleep
		early wherein i dreamt of riding on a train as if
		going from one compartment to another, there was
		a kitten in a waste basket as i passed through
		then two cats that looked worried so i picked them
		up to get them on their way noticing some much
		larger animal threatening them, i want to say it
		was an elephant yet it could have been a rhino -
		something grey at which point i awoke concerned
		since lotta would be traveling...i wondered if
		she was taking a train to her destination and
		nervously smoked through a couple of cups of coffee
		until seeing she was flying...i suppose amsterdam
		or copenhagen...since those flights match the 
		timeline although there were a couple to other
		parts of sweden but i doubt anything is going
		down in those places...before the settling knowledge
		i managed to nap but in such an odd manner that
		no logic manifested...i mean i was listening to
		someone i used to know speak, he kept talking
		as if in a race - when he started telling me
		about his son being better at drawing than at
		learning languages well i had to stop him, responding
		that it was not wise to speak so much...irl,
		he had a daughter...but rising i thought it might
		be about my first neighbors here, who were actually
		much nicer than those that remained, it was the
		same first name...yet in a split second i decided
		that it could be about the 'soho' residences across
		the street...one of which is guarded by a company
		strangely called cvs...cv being the person's initials,
		adding an s well if you have been in the states you
		most likely have come across that pharmacy chain...
		the last time i was there, buying camel blue hundreds,
		i picked up an electrical adaptor that still funtions.
		no matter, i followed through on my scale ritual and
		looked at 'advanced' chord shapes beyond the common
		ones i had not thought of much...there are about forty 
		and while i don't see myself employing a major seventh
		sharp 5 and sharp nine it might happen or help in other
		ways...the rest i know...i'm thinking in terms of jazz
		but it occurs to me that none of the jazz players i 
		heard speak ever talked chords at all...indeed, drugs
		mostly and onetime food...django reinhardt likely
		had more food than drugs but it gives me pause
		when i a see let us say the g major with an added 6th
		and ninth in his chord changes knowing the man had
		only had his thumb to balance two working fingers...
		      <br>
		      <br>
		      22 january
		      <br>
		      the other day, i awoke feeling that my skin was
		dry yet when i went to bathe it felt fine...i suspected
		that incident started what i hope is no series of dreams...
		well, it is not exactly in the category of dreams, more
		like a stop watch alerting loudly...'wake the fuck up'
		i heard stumbling out of scenes and even felt a hand
		pulling at my right shoulder - a few days ago which i
		never noted since it was neither thought nor dream or
		so it seemed...yesterday as i thought about lotta, 
		who actually went to berlin not the places i imagined,
		i dreamt i was making a telephone call in my room -
		yet i could sense and see a man listening in on
		the other side as in a wiretap...opening the door
		a scantily dressed or perhaps even naked man pranced
		about the hallway - for a second i considered the
		ghost of father yet more likely an impersonator...
		then a woman's voice saying loudly, 'where is my beau'
		of course i could net tell if she meant bow, or bo,
		or me...turkey ski resort disaster? needless to say
		i felt a bit lost, then much later i again dreamt 
		train station...nothing as nice as the kremlin lines
		or as dingy as the manhattan queens bronx stops,
		no something in between - possibly in europe...
		large white structures which i somehow stepped
		out of then unaware of my location or which way
		to go...in wandering and asking, how do i get back
		to the train station that goes everywhere, a woman
		volunteered to drive me...she seemed to be a mail
		carrier yet her car was a jigsaw puzzle of a station
		wagon - open at the back so the seats had to be turned
		so as to pretend the door was shut - i think she looked
		like shirley jackson...i'm two hundred pages into hangsaman -
		i can sort of tell when and where she leaves hints of
		herself...some weird synchronicty was going down as
		i read her writing about milton and i had very recently
		mentioned here the reference to the rose of sharon from
		paradise lost...moreover the sudden trailer for amanda's
		seven veils...two other men get in the post woman's rinky
		dink car and i awake before she gets in the driver;s seat -
		i was also in the middle of viewing the french film
		'a second act' it is terribly exciting in that there are
		two scripts streaming in the form of a romance as well as
		the actors really reacting to eachother as if in ad libs
		or so it seems when the lines are really good - i left
		it to give it more attention later...
		      (not long after i learned the story about
		      steely dan's second arrangement...along
		      with how one of them was dumped and then
		      hit by a car...this was gaucho...they say
		      one of the recording engineers erased the
		      masters and the new take didn't feel right
		      so it was left off the album, somehow there
		      are surfaced renditions of the tune now...
		      i gave it a listen, not exactly sure if
		      i liked it...then i borrowed the notion that
		      they didn't like it either since they never
		      played it live and so the eraser tale might
		      simply be a myth to add to the legend of 
		      their last record which indeed has other
		      great songs...it is only fair to state that
		      other ears consider the "lost" song as genius...)
		      i gave an extra
		turn to the newer scales and went to sleep...which i am
		about to attempt again - sleep, that is, given that i
	        only slept for a couple of hours as if i needed to 
		see it was the sly hotel and wish for lotta's success more
		sincerely as i felt some sort of intensity and then
		possibly became too casual or even distracted in what
		i termed worship. 
			      post-script, lots of thought in dream
		      instead of dreaming...is the rock and roll hall
		      of fame for rap, does that mean spoken word will
		      be included...i agree with jerry that it is another
		      category but i also think the nature of rebellion
		      does exist in some rap - i mean sabotage by the
		      beastie boys could be either rock or rap...the
		      contradiction comes becomes irony as a lot of spoken word
		      artists do not play any instruments unless one
		      is more careful in judgement and views the vocal
		      as a type of musical instrument in the way actors
		      view their body...but then does that mean that
		      ai composed songs will be eligible for such honors...
		      my feeling is that it is all right to not limit
		      what rock was or will be yet for my money if there
		      is no guitar it ain't rocking and i think that is
		      what garcia meant...
		      aside from pondering in the lake of rapid eye
		      movement...before rising from bed, i felt as if a
		      hairdresser studying the back of someone's head -
		      i think it was someone i didn't like and still don't,
		      which reminds me that i also thought and dreamt of
		      an ex-girlfriend...no i do not know how to balance
		      friendships and love...does marriage mean no real
		      friends, it can't be or maybe why so many divorces...
		      i can't seem to clearly define devotion without
		      some sort of disregard for new faces yet that
		      feels extreme as it produces a weird guilt since
		      no one is above or better than anyone else yet
		      equally to accept someone alongside love leads
		      to impossible confusion. no fair solution. i hope
		      i am being as kind as possible to all that care about
		      me, especially the women. to give a specific example
		      i should have already taken the time to listen to 
		      julia yet in my concern for self and worship i left
		      it for later...as you can see, i am wrong even if
		     i am right because in setting boundaries to my bliss
		      i have missed that moment...and i wonder if by 
		      respecting someone am i disrespecting another...
		      but i mean no disrespect, or as hunter put placed
		      it, 'pay the ticket; take the ride.' yes, we
		      are professionals, after all or will our children
		      face the induction of sped-up renditions of songs..
		      ps, speaking of songs hollywood land was re-released
		      now as i fininshed reading the novel...the writing
		      in the ending parts is nothing short of wonderful
		      however since i picked it up after seeing the film
		      i was expecting natalie to go missing...yet i can 
		      see her point in terms of poetry...that is the girl
		      we are reading about by the end is not the same girl
		      from the start...there is an evolution, an arch, a 
		      journey which i suppose she meant to empower future
		      girls...you don't have to fit in, you can overcome
		      the feelings and even the failures filling up the
		      pathway...moreover it blended nearly to a match with
		      the ending of 'hotel'...without the scream, of course. 
		      <br>
		      <br>
		      23 january<br>
		      <br>
		      'a second act' turned out too good to explain, exceeding
		      itself somehow and whatever it is one might be expecting.
		      even the tracking shot ending shooting its own trail...
		      well, there really there are no words to describe it
		      without giving away extensive spoilers so i will simply
		      recommend it to dear readers that enjoy goodly cinema. 
		      excellent. i went to sleep a bit later searching around
		      nearly aimlessly except to see if the flight from berlin
		      had gotten into stockholm...in my dream i am running
		      with only shoes and shorts - it is the upper west side
		      - broadway and i notice a woman making herself at home
		      on the sidewalk by one of the columbia buildings - there
		      is a dollar bill in triangular shape which i step on
		      while jogging and for a second think to grab it yet
		      at the same time think of paris france and how some
		      flimflam folk put place money in front of themselves
		      to trip up the unsuspecting person passing by so i
		      keep going on my way - now with a panic that i have
		      left without taking my keys yet i feel them in a 
		      pocket on the right side - a moment later i notice
		      a crowd and turn away to run down amsterdam avenue
		      and head back home...three men of the crowd seem
		      to be chasing me and my left shoe needs to be adjusted
		      as i was wearing it like a slipper and now needed to
		      go faster - i adjust the sneaker and start to race yet
		      pretty soon they are upon me - well one of them is -
		      i neither recognixe the face nor like it and i start
		      saying 'only titty only' not knowing exactly why
		      or possibly 'only teeter only' 
		      as he reaches for me i twist his wrist into a break
		      suddenly returning to the speed of my stride yet
		      scared then awaking confused...not over the borderline
		      nightmare as it is maybe par for course in terms of
		      city dwelling but the utterly bizarre phrase spoken
		      as if a foreign girl trying to save herself without
		      knowing the english words for what she was trying to 
		      convey in order to escape...earlier in the day, after
		      taking a shower, i felt an intense pain invading my
		      right thigh and upon waking i wondered if there was 
		      a connection...hmm, the keys were the ones before 
		      they switched to an expensive multi-lock key or so
		      it seemed from the feel of them...weird, i still
		      have those keys for no specific reason. 
		      <br>
		      <br>
		      24 january
		      <br>
		      i failed to consider the dream in terms of time travel...
		      ttty is word coined in 1820...yet before and after that
		      date there were; tittymal, tittymal, tittytotty, tittybar,
		      tittybag, and tittybottle or one could go futher back into
		      into the 1700s with tittup, tittuping, and later tittupy...
		      as for teeter, it's from the Middle English titeren 
		     to totter, reel; akin to Old High German zittarōn to shiver...
		      i thought it could be a chinese mispronounciation due to
		      the R if it was teeter yet the idea doesn't work since it
		      is at the end of the word...in any case, i felt awful
		      sad through the morning yesterday and pretty unwilling
		      to do much in the afternoon...the only bright period
		      was viewing the hangman, no relation to hangsaman, as
		      i did not recall watching tina in a motion picture...
		      as much as i am opposed to the boob tube, i sure 
		      cannot deny being raised and entertained by it...
		      it was also nice to see demi get a nom even if the
		      academy did not respect the balance by leaving margaret
		      out as it were...anyway i still wanted to nothing
		      and carried on in that manner until deciding at the
		      last minute to switch back to an earlier design for
		      my web domains...but this was only due to the fact 
		      that the videos were not playing in opera mobile browsers-
		      they seemed fine on chrome and the desktop version of
		      opera and safari mobile...which is prolly still the case
		      as i hope opera mobile will return to normal...so all
		      i did was that and eat leftovers with lettuce then
		      a bag of chips and a cute chunk of gouda...sprite,
		      coffee, cigarettes, and scales...it even felt like
		      too much of a task to bathe...although i did shave...
		      spirit of lynch perhaps, the solitary ant crawling
		      around my cellphone out of nowhere...they were sugar
		      ants but they were coming in for water, he had said
		      once upon a time...i had recently read laura's letter
		      with feelings and memories so exact that no one could
		      believe me if i told them...my conflict with this arises
		      from the michael j anderson slander and the julee cruise
		      rant although in her case it was later edited down so
		      that it is not easily found online whereas the man from
		      the other place was basically silenced by itself being
		      so extreme as well as by the lack of response it got -
		      jennifer did argue against it but i believe she is the
		      only one...i note these things as conflicts within myself
		      because i always felt they, not jen, were sort of the 
		      pieces, important pieces, that belonged to lynch, that
		      were part of him or his persona if you will...if you
		      look for the dwarf it will only say he is 'retired' and
		      the crooner will say she committed suicide while listening
		      to the b-52s' roam...yes i know this must not be interesting
		      to anyone else yet my emotional investment in the lynchian
		      universe is left with that chaos...i've always felt his
		      characters were a sort of family - i suppose it still makes
		      sense given the turmoil within my actual family...i suspect
		      this will never be resolved...maybe i should consider it 
		      'nonexistent'...now these thoughts are shared to also clarify
		      why i gave mja space in the list while dedicating the song
		      to dl and "liking' so many tribute posts at instagram...
		      one and the same, it was about the arm and the giant...but
		      that is  how i saw this 'giant' director and him...to think 
		      of it he saw it too, otherwise why would he cast the arm
		      atop the throne of mulholland drive...let me conclude this
		      with a quote from it, "You want me to make this easy for you?
		      No fucking way! It's not gonna be. It's not easy for me!"
		      in my dream there is a big plate of bacon although i have
		      been keeping kosher for sometime now, as i eat i wonder if
		      it is the facon that i heard emily speak of...i don't miss
		      it and this is also the case with most food...i suppose
		      i see it as a mere necessity...something to do while watching
		      a film...i left a short film called the death of a shadow
		      when i realized it was a short film...even if it did seem
		      enticing in some ways...like meat-flavored ice cream, i
		      think well i like short films but how will i ever get around
		      to them or worse list the ones about writers...and if so
		      would one not be forced to include social media tapes in the
		      category...i can hardly do my job in terms of tvc15...
		      when i looked it up, i noticed a dozen titles but then as
		      i researched i found there is no end to it not now with
		      the several many prodco's spilling out a series every 
		      couple of days...later in my dream, i am standing in a
		      room where a man has just been murdered, they are putting
		      him in a sort of duffel bag or heavy trash bag that is
		      tightened by tape at the ankle torso and neck areas...
		      i guess we are going to dump the body in the nearest 
		      lake or river...perhaps ocean...somehow i am neither
		      surprised nor interested in the proceedings...i had gone
		      to complete harlot's ghost yet i found i had actually 
		      read most of it and it wasn't helping my inertia -
		      turning to the letters of shirley jackson i started
		      thinking of cake as she mentions it and put that away
		      as well not wanting to excite myself over the only
		      food i actually craved a few months ago...maybe i have
		      simply read too much and need to press pause on the books.

		      25 january<br>
		      <br>
		      dream of no easy situation - an airport it seemed,
		      all the luggage is on the floor...there is a man
		      that would appear to have been looking through them -
		      he is now in a squat beside a large collection of 
		      lipsticks as if inspecting them - it is then i say
		      something not audible enough to recollect as he
		      removes some of the caps and flings the lower portion
		      in a manner that can only be described as disdain -
		      i believe it is at this point that i got up for a second
		      to turn off the fan as i actually felt the cool sweet
		      air of winter...the lights had gone out before i went
		      to sleep but not more than half an hour...earlier
		      they had been out for three hours...i felt as if
		      it was some sort of signal...i had mostly escaped
		      some caravan song blaring out on the street and
		      even the mobile aguacate vendor shouts as well as
		      the compramos todo lo que sea viejo mantra with
		      murder on the dancefloor headphone playing...a
		      signal that the intrusive sounds are required?
		      well, the lights go out now as i tyoe this -
		      i flick ashes into my coffee instead of ashtray
		      in the sudden darkness - the bar game we played
		      on doped dummy's when they turned their heads...
		      over the hills and faraway - where was i oh yeah
		      faced with the non electric chunk of time i washed
		      my hair and watched 'ace in the hole' - a pretty
		      worthwhile study of character and intuition...
		      somehow it was getting late and i went into
		      my scale ritual then bed fromw which you already
		      have the scene noted...later i dreamt i was 
		      shopping naked...didn't feel strange as i 
		      pulled at bags to gather the goods except then
		      it wasn't groceries but gaby or gabriella...
		      i guess i need to find a middle ground name for
		      her since the first feels too informal and the
		      second quadruples the syllables...i think it
		      is the only time i have dreamt of her...not
		      much time to play or pal around as some strange
		      and strong man insisted on displaying his talent
		      of twusting necks - the ghost of burt reynolds
		      said something but i could only think hey it's
		      burt reynolds...you know fangirl syndrome - anyway
		      one guy gets his neck twisted and seems to die,
		      then another stands before the strange strong
		      man and the same happens but this time he props
		      him up and twists again until the poor fellow
		      returns to life or at least what is left of 
		      life after a near death experience...somehow
		      this leads to me buying a suit, i am trying on
		      a quasy fancy teal blazer and i tell the sales
		      person that the sleeves are too long which he
		      refutes - showing me that he is wearing the same
		      jacket and it is fine on him failing to take into
		      account that i'm 5'7 and he is at least 5'9 maybe
		      six feet tall...we wander over to find a replacement -
		      now back at where i had got the bags - the strange
		      strong man is surrounded by law enforcement agents
		      and pulls out ice skates to cut the soles of his
		      feet, i notice them bloody and think he is going
		      to launch himself into battle, his type of warpaint
		      i suppose...i woke up not really caring to find out
		      what became of that brute...a sigh moment after
		      typing that sentence the lights flip on...my eyes
		      adjust...my only plan for the day is to avoid the
		      delivery of cash that was sent despite me insisting
		      the money be used to hurry the arrival of my new
		      guitar...in my calculations it seems logical...get
		      it monday after i know the box is on its way. 
		      <br>
		      <br>
		      26 jan
		      <br>
		      about yesterday, how could i ever call that a day?
		      it was a saturday, yet minutes after typing that
		      note, there it was again another lights out moment
		      that lasted hours leaving the soup incomplete...
		      the only bright spot was avoiding all the noises
		      via headphones yet even that was soured by the
		      return of the delivery man as if intent on seeing
		      me...shouting the name he thinks is me and somehow
		      getting in the building and banging on the front
		      door...i was playing scales which i actually did
		      thrice while waiting in the dark...thinking why
		      would someone do that without first confirming
		      via phone...it is the usual proceedure...olives
		      chips and cheese with a lukewarm sprite as i 
		      watched the linguini incident, am awful movie
		      that has one magical scene where the lead actress
		      questions how many would like to see her drown
		      and turn blue at which point the real wife of
		      the lead actor raises her hand...it's a howl!
		      by the time i got to the soup i didn't want it
		      but had it anyway for the sake of nourishment -
		      the awaited package did not get past set up and
		      is supposed to go out today or tomorrow...i was
		      neither disappointed nor surprised but sort of
		      weirded out by how the whole day went...anyway
		      it will still take a couple of weeks to arrive...
		      dreams never arrived except for a very clear
		      and nearly impossible vision of a man that i can
		      only describe as a santa claus type, marx every
		      body nose there ain't no sanity clause, uhm yea
		      white hair and beard in a glowing living room
		      with a fireplace chimney like i have never seen
		      before...it was nearly shocking as it made me
		      think of the letter jfk wrote to that child who
		      asked if there was such a thing...i awoke with
		      everything feeling far away...even the coffee.
		      on my second cup, i suppose it would all be all
		      right if in fact lotta didn't feel so far away...
		      i am about to look at her new video now, it 
		      seemed unusual that she showed no enthusiasm
		      for berlin, no reaction in a sense...in fact
		      she posted a scene from the rose club instead -
		      i don't know how i remember such details yet
		      i can only imagine that i do for some specific
		      reason...now sunday, which turn will this take?
		      <br>
		      <br>
		      27 january<br>
		      <br>
		      what was sunday, well it started off weird
		      and nearly desperate although i'd be hard pressed
		      to offer explanations...like awaking to a feeling
		      that the day has already paased you by, left you
		      too late to catch up...how strange you may ask,
		      well to jizz in the pants while not exactly 
		      excited while sitting down is how...then i
		      planned a night full of rain along with rice
		      and steak yet i couldn't get through it and
		      i didn't really want to go back...i gave up
		      and took a nap wherein i dreamt i was fixing
		      a shower...standing in water facing three
		      shower heads one of them was overloaded with
		      frames, like eight by ten picture frames,
		      i removed these and showed them to someone,
		      an older man that was not pleased and threatened
		      to fire me...maybe in some dream world i am a 
		      plumber...well knowing i have no career ambition
		      in that area i return to the showerheads and
		      slide them up the wall, they are all spouting
		      or squirting if you will...i remove one and find
		      a flexible hose which i put place in mouth as
		      one does when siphoning gasoline...i am surprised
		      then that i can breathe perhaps believing myself
		      underwater...i awake and see lotta's shower...
		      it makes me feel more in sync with myself and
		      i even find a guitar case sale which i jump on -
		      five or six guitars with only one case, obviously
		      i need help...but then seeing her praise some
		      tv actor takes me all the way back to too much
		      heaven and i let the song float around for a while
		      even looking at the chords...pictures of you by the
		      cure might have been more adequate yet not as pleasant...
		      i go to sleep feeling like a peasant in a kingdom
		      which taxes and takes no notice of peasants...
		      i dream of the now antique batman, specifically
		      adam west...yet it's all vague...nothing to report,
		      it is my preferred batman in terms of style and
		      writing...those scribes never got enough credit...
		      although their scripts are the blueprint for the
		      caped crusader's empire...i suppose there were
		      other scenes which simply escaped...i only recall
		      the vivid replaying of one of my songs - dialdialler,
		      or some may think it is called high fidelity...
		      so i awake at least feeling all right about the music
		      except was the whole week about some wicked doppleganger,
		      youtube video ad twice seen parents telling a child
		      we never told you you had a twin sibling...good
		      grief charlie brown...did the act of giving my
		      plumber shoes turn out worse for wear...is the road
		      to hell paved with good intentions...and why did
		      bat token make it a dispute in refusing to deposit
		      the final pay out...the browser row rekindled while
		      searching for a replacement to opera mobile...
		      i research butter now unwilling to study porn
		      for the previous fright, i am looking for the
		      golden canned one with a cow's head on the label,
		      i might be mistaken over the bovine but not the 
		      light bronze shiny color...i come up with golden
		      churn butter and wijsman but think maybe red
		      feather has a new label...anyway something like
		      this might be an option since they have a long
		      shelf life...moreover, i found there is a such
		      a thing as powdered butter which supposedly one
		      merely adds water and voila...who knew? leads
		      to the trite what will they think of next...
		      wait i should have said beurre bretel instead
		      of red feather but since i am not certain of
		      the pronounciation i will let it be...i will
		      conclude this particular note with the buffalo
		      lament, we all saw the ball hit the ground but
		      the refs now seem to allow the chiefs a completion
		      as the nfl appears to want another taylor swift
		      super bowl...it would be shocking if jane's addiction
		      had not wroted 'nothing's shocking'...
		      <br>
		      <br>
		      28 january<br>
		      <br>
		      tuesday. i should clarify 'a night full of rain'...
		      it was interesting however i might not have been
		      in the right state of mind to enjoy it, so i left
		      italy of the late sixties or early seventies only
		      to return to italy in the forties...that is to 
		      say; across the river and into the trees...
		      obviously for danny huston but as i watched i
		      found i could not turn away from viewing...it
		      is such a gentle poem which contains such harsh
		      and rough lines, like a wood carving...for most
		      of it i did not recognize matilda perhaps too
		      thrilled by the plot and how i understood nearly 
		      all the native talking except when the black shirts
		      stood by the cafe speaking...anyway i really liked
		      this one even if the ending matched what i was 
		      expecting, i suppose i didn't expect liev to be
		      that good and deangelis was great...there were
		      moments when her expression said so much, well
		      her eyes...yet let me not over do it as i don't
		      want anyone looking at it as if it needs to be
		      true for them, that was my truth in that point in
		      time, i cannot guarantee such magic for anyone else -
		      for all i know, you might prefer ' a night full of rain'...
		      which i left after only a few minutes...
		      monday was the day the money came, it reminds me
		      of the mae west quip when she is told ten men
		      are waiting for her and she says send one of them
		      home because i am feeling a bit tired...i ordered
		      a coke and non menthol smokes, since pepsi has
		      basically been outlawed here and the sweet cigarettes
		      were going too quickly...all week i awoke as if 
		      sleeping strained my back and then sit worried, smoking
		      and wondering what on earth is going on...like there
		      is an invisible jigsaw puzzle which then leaves me
		      reluctant to engage with the rest of the day...what is
		      that horrible word i hardly ever use...ah yes lethargic.
		      a few minutes after the soda and so called cancer sticks,
		      the pizza arrived, luckily i looked before unlocking 
		      the door to see yet again someone intent on mixing in
		      behind the delivery as if i was also greeting them...
		      enjoyment seemed out of the question as i face the
		      pie thinking of how late it already was which then
		      translated into staying up way past my bed time...
		      in feeling i had to finish seeing the film, then
		      finalizing the new domain designs and augmenting
		      the cinema list...finally in bed, bowie songs
		      i had heard the day before howled in memory -
		      as if the time i knew that delivery was knocking
		      returned like a spiritual investigation...i guess
		      there is a danger in handing over a piece of
		      identification to receive them dollars...but 
		      there is no other logical way to do such things...
		      well, not until electronic currency becomes the
		      standard...i went to sleep sort of praying that
		      the box had been picked up and was now on its
		      way...christmas in february...i hesitate to continue
		      since i don't want to name the actress i was thinking
		      of then possibly dreaming of but honestly i think
		      there was a message and i don't know who those women
		      in my dream were...all i know was one was blonde and
		      the other not so blonde...if brunette or even darker
		      hair i cannot say...she was extremely happy with me
		      but i kept wondering why the blonde was upset as it
		      seemed to have something to do with me...something
		      i did or did not do? she only walked away when i tried
		      to ask...if i let instinct have its say, well then 
		      obviously i have put placed lotta well beyond what
		      would be fair in terms ot attention and so jealousy
		      might be the easy answer...there have been days where
		      not much gets done other thinking of her...this stems
		      from other questions i cannot quiz myself with and
		      expect correct answers as well as the blurred stance
		      which cannot lean into an exact emotion given all
		      that has transpired. not just with her, but with
		      myself. not to mention the impossible situation
		      which has no way to balance itself in terms of
		      'family' life and the utterly ironic fact of folks
		      then disguised to dismantle affection for their 
		      own favor. in other words, situations i cannot
		      control and once in a while make me jump to 
		      conclusions that drift too far away from the rational.
		      from the real. if nothing is good or bad based on
		      thinking or point of view, there should be no feeling
		      involved yet since we all know there is - there are
		      emotions, well - it must be
		      that ol willy shakes was partly mistaken in that
		      particular line...

		      29 january
		      <br>
		      i always like to celebrate bridget's birthday and although
		      i didn't want to explain the bathing gif i find myself
		      compelled to mention it because the next film i viewed
		      happened to be ladies of leisure which somehow had
		      barbara bathing that in turn consumated varda's idea
		      for me; 'cinema is my home, i think i have always lived
		      in it'...in other words i felt as if the films were
		      speaking to eeach other and for a minute allowed me
		      to listen...now then yesterday, i uncluttered the
		      balcony - moved one of the sofas and found a listin
		      diario from 23 august 2023...hidden under the seat,
		      given the date it could not have been mother or
		      the related guests that got to visit last fall,
		      2024...it certainly wasn't my doing...it would
		      be an unlikely scenario to consider that skirt
		      pawed the paper into the couch...which leaves only
		      the intrusion of someone invading while i was out -
		      that particular wednesday was pretty eventful,
		      not to mention it would have been soraya's birthday -
		      even here a sort of hurricane was twisting the wind...
		      no matter, as much as i want to think of it as a 
		      message, the raid fact diminishes any logic, if 
		      someone can't pick up a phone or write a note -
		      well in this case possibly simply knock on the 
		      door it obviously implies something that cannot be
		      good - cannot be intended to help but to hurt -
		      i came up with this later as at the time of the
		      finding i was very intent on doing some cleaning -
		      the living room and dining table were next, i
		      stepped into the kitchen listening to rockabilly
		      and also got that done, even set myself up for
		      laundry and disinfected what is usually called
		      here the maid's quarters...i have been purchasing
		      litre bottles of coca cola to line up against the
		      woven metal back door and gate - both of which
		      have, i estimate, enough space for creepy crawlers
		      to slide through, i think there are fourteen now
		      and i have three more in reserve...anyway, for
		      some reason i wasn't hungry the whole day -
		      and so i continued my clorox party into the 
		      main living spaces and then the bathroom - meaning
		      yes i got most of the house in order...i need to 
		      find a way to cover my shoes...the dust somehow
		      accumulates with such insidious speed...but in
		      not wanting to use bags, i wonder what options
		      remain...eating my pizza at what would have
		      been an hour before midnight in sweden, i liked
		      the feeling of clean although i loathe the act
		      of cleaning for the fact that it merely requires
		      more cleaning before long...i suppose in contemplating
		      all this it was midnight here before i could finally
		      fall asleep...i don't have any dream to report as
		      the scenes were vague...getting up again i had a
		      memory of being in some sort of bar or club...women
		      therein as if evaluating themselves in terms of 
		      who i like or love...my erection wanting to be pleased
		      but also wanting to pee...my inclination for fantasy
		      put aside in considering it would be noon time elsewhere,
		      naked peeing worried that there would be bleach residue
		      upon my soles since the tiles still felt moist, i dressed
		      for coffee and smokes, the cell rang, no lettuce and
		      no rosemary...what could i say...all right...the order
		      will arrive anytime between now and eleven...i let go
		      of some aelf coin to get ondo...the box was collected
		      and is scheduled to arrive in two or three weeks...
		      i am hopeful about this haul yet it also makes me feel
		      selfish, as if i were too rich or something although
		      it is not exactly the case...i guess i have misjudged
		      my self love, maybe i need to love myself more and
		      merely rejoice in the material possessions that are
		      coming...likely the catholic mindset, heaven and 
		      eyes of needles and camels or whatever it was...original
		      sin and guilt...gulp, i gallop through lotta's latest
		      posts...not signing up for her handmade hair brush
		      giveaway slash raffle so as not to make her feel any
		      pressure from me...oh but they are so lovely, still,
		      whatever i do for her i do freely, the courts have
		      said marriage is no longer sexual servitude...the 
		      nerve! of course, it is otherwise what is the point?
		      ok, ok, if an asexual man marries and asexual woman,
		      maybe that argument has a leg to stand on...i surrender,
		      dear reader, you got me, yes i miss the golden olden
		      era of slavery. in fact, i can't imagine how we've
		      all gotten along without it.

		      30 january
		      <br>
		      well, on second thought, we haven't...a lot of structures
		      are so based on it that the work still stands in a sense.
		      to leave the frying pan and lean into the fire, robots
		      are the easy answer...i see now that i am not the only
		      one that senses the need for that...automated machine
		      servitude already has a long history...yet this is only
		      a random thought which flowed out of sarcasm...
		      imagine if the all the jews had to go back to egypt!
		      a word to the wise, don't get too sarcastic with ai...
		      it's thursday, i don't want to write about babygirl -
		      i did not enjoy seeing the beautiful nicole appear
		      older...vulnerable...at the start i felt a tug or
		      perhaps it could be termed a wink at eyes wide shut,
		      but the woman has more power now except there is a 
		      glitch in her that propells the narrative...i suppose
		      one could argue over the brilliance of the quirky
		      metaphor but for myself i had to skip over the 
		      father figure song and dance sequence as it felt
		      as cornball corny as denying the minimum wage is a type
		      of modern slavery...anyway her acting was like always
		      sublime yet i didn't feel that level of emotion with
		      the other players, the husband seemed confused, last
		      to know syndrome, antonio hit the highmark with the
		      commercial boy on his lap going this child has a tumor -
		      meanwhile the lover had this split personality question
		      and smirk which looked like someone high on certain
		      drugs...still i liked the early collage with the 
		      dog hovering over her on the street and the seemingly
		      extasy riddled club date...but as the culmination fight
		      fizzled out and life went back to normal for lack of
		      a better word, the implication baffles...that is the
		      lover now alone in a hotel room giving the dog quality
		      time...although it gives one a reason to want to look
		      at nightbitch - which i haven't been inclined to view -
		      it does not make sense - well perhaps to people who
		      really like canines...if memory serves kubrick ended
		      with the child sort of dissolving into the department
		      store...this was also christmas...the doctor's wife
		      saying we need to fuck - an ending which does not lose
		      its grace even if it is a curse word, you could watch
		      it ten times and the charm sticks like he knew somehow
		      that even if he had a hundred variations there could
		      only be one way - a sort of cinematic alchemy. now i
		      seen one reputable reviewer term babygirl as bliss
		      and i seen the australian say she never had so many
		      orgasms...my apologies to tom and keith for even 
		      mentioning that in passing...however or despite those
		      opinions, i didn't find it sexual per se, in fact i
		      wondered much more about her ears as if that character
		      had worn heavy earrings for too long. in other words
		      this is no sequel to the masterpiece mentioned but
		      a pretty strange plot with a near enough hollywood
		      ending which might have been better served by one
		      of the characters being murdered and perhaps a court
		      or insane asylum ending sequence with or without the puppy.
		      hush puppy - if only they had picked rough boys instead
		      of george michael - oh well, pete isn't lucky with soundtracks -
		      don't mind me i'm only waking up and suddenly feeling my
		      dream vanish...in it i was being chased, i felt fear and
		      still feel a bit nervous...i haven't looked at the news
		      yet although  i did look at lotta's new postings...i love
		      the way she looks when rising in the morning...donnerstag
		      i think is the german word...i hope i can return to my 
		      schedule, cleaning the house and then laundry yesterday
		      took me further into undefined distractions...of course
		      more money or even a simpler say one bedroom place would
		      solve that but to clarify i don't want to be so rich,
		      only wealthy enough to help others and have more guitars. 
		      <br>
		      <br>
		      31 january<br>
		      <br>
		      after another slightly unusual day, i mean i went back
		      to sleep dreaming in what seemed to be london wherein
		      a fat man was trying to massage lotta and i was upset
		      then upon an avenue partly crowded where i noticed
		      a naked girl sitting on the street as if oblivious
		      to her surroundings as a walking girl said something
		      along the lines of he's looking for gold, i thought
		      she meant me yet of course it could have been meant
		      in terms of someone else, i turned then looking more
		      at the building structures and thinking about my 
		      pants wondering if the penis was getting an erection
		      or if the erection was subsiding, a mid-term in 
		      between bop which obviously confused me...i awoke and
		      thought about it for a while...without conclusion 
		      except marianne faithfull died...from what i read
		      it seems she suffered greatly in the last few years -
		      i was suffering through the lillian gish film although
		      i wanted to see these actresses i did not want to be
		      reminded of what both my aunt and mother are going 
		      through...i left it before an hour had passed and
		      don't really want to return...i had a light meal and
		      planned to pack it in early as it were, playing through
		      the twenty scale ritual and some chord shapes, i 
		      tried to hypnotize myself into slumber yet the dona
		      leida was being shouted as if buzzers and phones were
		      illegal so i struggled through that sound in my head
		      as if suddenly empty of thought...i suppose since i 
		      can no longer count how many times that stranger has
		      yelled out to be let in...a bit later in sleep again
		      i dream i am chased...awaking as if wounded by nerves -
		      yet the scene blurred and dissolved leaving only 
		      the anxiety as i thought it is probably too early
		      to start the day, in another dream a woman i do not
		      know is buying glasses and suggesting i should get the
		      same ones...i explain that i do not like the style -
		      the optic man was then angry and started on a rant
		      about how good they were and how fairly priced they
		      were at this point in time, i shrugged repeating i 
		      simply don't like them - walking away with her next
		      to me i notice they are raybans and have second thoughts
		      about not getting them but i still feel them as unattractive,
		      i think i already have raybans as i now walk in a snow laced
		      street alone, it seems to be 109th between columbus and
		      amsterdam and i am considering how to navigate the crossing
		      as the snow has piled up and it looks as if a nearly 
		      frozen river lake has formed - a grey mystery that might
		      be hip high i evaluated avoiding it by swerving wide -
		      i enter a shop and find myself counting the dollars to 
		      pay, a hundred and fifty dollars, maybe it was a tom petty
		      honeybee dream, but what was i buying...whatever it was
		      cost more than that and i awoke before finding out the
		      outcome...the obituary party was in full swing as sometimes
		      occurs at the passing of someone important - muhammad deif,
		      loretta ford, wolfgang zweiner, and dick button...i considered
		      the last three for a minute...i want to wrap you in plastic
		      and put you in freezing water...sheryl doing david's voice
		      in a video i saw after natalie...memory of her 'ugly' scene
		      in we are the sickest band movie goes like lightning through
		      memory reflecting how i feel once in a while at cell camera
		      glimpse...u-g-l-y, you aint got no alibi, you ugly your momma
		      says your fugly...1986 wildcats...dick laurant is dead kicks
		      off the spiral in lost highway and that comes to mind upon
		      the button note...i bring it up because it is exactly part
		      of the point here...i think scientologists call it an engram,
		      a phrase, a set of words, or even one word might in fact
		      trigger unimaginable effects...giving weight to burroughs's
		      hypothesis that language is a virus...i next ring up 
		      why some folks need you or insist without exact logic for
		      you to mirror someone or something...conformity i suppose,
		      the status quo...i haven't mentioned it but recently have
		      felt that pull...yet the put down goes further back - 
		      a control mechanism that concentrates on some flaw or
		      even false vision to bury self in despair or at least 
		      doubts...which in turn makes one feel as if proof or
		      some substantial reaction would be needed...of course
		      in logic, i know that i needn't prove anything having
		      possibly accomplished more than i ever imagined except
		      for climbing the mountain of unedited manuscripts in
		      that suitcase which i keep waiting - as life has given no 
		      quarter yet to settle that score...excuse my untimely
		      rant, now as i consider these things i think my concern
		      is precisely or only those voices, hmm, those eys without
		      faces, that further the insanity by insisting it is all
		      to help you or the like...yes, similar to a 1940s skit
		      going do you have two tens for a five...which i might
		      further make more ironic by underlining the missing
		      fifteen by which i mean aunt;s house.

		      wordstar.nexus dreamnweaver note will be updated
		      soon...i was about to dress up the waiting page
		      with a few words but after watching myrna loy
		      and ian hunter, in 'to mary - with love', i 
		      thought i should not rush through...there is
		      a scene where they, as mary and bill, are smoking
		      in the dark so one mostly only sees the smoke...
		      it was 1936, i dare say it is the greatest single
		      sequence involving cigarettes in the history of
		      cinema...john cromwell directed that - sydney
		      wagner was the cinematographer - mark lee kirk
		      was the art director - and ralph dietrich was
		      the editor. even in my sloppy print, it looked
		      magical...outstanding.
		      post-script; i am considering put placing
		      the earlier dream notes and other content
		      here; https://wordstar.gitbook.io/inkrealm

		      february 5 2025<br>
		      <br>

		      that kid from wahoo nebraska sure put out some
		      fine photo plays...burroughs happy birthday
		      viewed the 1920s as a doorway...i feel pretty
		      fine when the 1930s proves me right...i was
		      thinking of jennifer singing take me back a
		      minute ago - charlotte rampling we like
		      especially because she seems to carry that
		      aura from those ancient times...it has only
		      been a few days but trying to recall the 
		      events feels like searching through antiquities -
		      there is no law i am breaking by missing a
		      dream, but somehow it feels criminal...
		      allow me to slip start by not a dream but a
		      glance...at a glance, there it was, the most
		      evil thing i have ever witnessed...a feral
		      cat had caught a rock dove either right there
		      adjacent to the back door or carried up from
		      the ground level - i;m on the second floor -
		      a feather in its mouth, the pigeon in pieces,
		      i didn't want to study the scene yet i do 
		      suspect it was feeding upon the capture...
		      it stayed there a while as i disinfected
		      my side of that area and now all that is left
		      are the remains of the bird...my own cat
		      kept away from the mess yet he did display
		      a bit of a frenzy as if celebrating the 
		      murder...the killing brought to mind the
		      black crows' remedy...i had actually heard
		      it the day before...a look at the lyric will
		      mafe the reference self-explanatory - 
		      make...there is no math for visions...
		      they tell me maafe is peanut stew...
		      i suppose i hesitated to jot the dream that
		      made me pause...i was in bed with robyn,
		      both of us nude, touching her i praised
		      her skin and she was self effacing pointing
		      out some acne here or there to which i 
		      responed with temporary logic, not a flaw...
		      she was on my right side hovering to the
		      left as i awoke feeling bewildered by 
		      still sensing the actual touch and then of 
		      course a bit baffled expecting it would
		      have been lotta...still it killed loneliness
		      like that auslander killed the bird...
		      skirt once caught a bird yet in such a gentle
		      way that it was able to fly away when i picked
		      it up...no other dream to really note, there
		      was a scene wherein a man was trying to sit
		      on my feet, looked like a nephew, there was
		      a vibe like some girl had been cheating - 
		      awaking to the no logic frenzy...another
		      where someone was visiting, a stranger in
		      a suit...he went right into the bath - soaking
		      there all dressed up...it was awfully unexpected -
		      like an extended dream conversation which feels
		      as if someone is merely extracting data let us
		      term it a download dream...possibly why the song
		      don't start me talkin' i'll tell everything i know
		      was wroted...wiretap paranoia might expand to 
		      unimaginable scenarios when you consider ai 
		      is able to clone any voice...so while i did have
		      at least one other dream to mention, i motion
		      against it given the fact that i am not certain
		      if in fact it was a conversation or a set up -
		      the next feeling inertia and worry mingle and
		      that horrific sensation that one has been replaced
		      by someone else - in this case specifically i mean
		      folks involved with my sister...don henley plays
		      dirty laundry...what is it akin to, well it would
		      be plausible that the number of surrounding juans
		      is an area scheme in order to mask under the 
		      nearby church and school...normally it would
		      seem only logical to be surrounded my marias...
		      i've met more marias in the soviet lands than 
		      all my time here...hmm be that as it may, i 
		      obtained a couple of india eisley films -
		      american outlaws...simply terrible save for
		      her self yet even herself was overwhelmed
		      by her tits...no wonder actresses are now being
		      cast as chairs...we are not going to speak about
		      my furniture...it was a true story but her 
		      counterparts failed horribly in caricature instead
		      of craft...you feel the stupidity much more than
		      the history which is constantly floated by like
		      a hallucination motif...so i had little hope
		      for every breath you take and i was not disappointed
		      as it was also pretty bad although by some luck
		      there were no breast on show...again, the cardboard
		      cut out acting by her costars and the gullible nature of her character that
		      is to say bad writing leaves one dismissing it as
		      soon as it is over...maybe her beauty is a curse,
		      oh we can cast her alonside any old hack and if
		      all else fails...tits...but she's above average
		      and it is tragic when these sorts of contradictions
		      present themselves. i was then trying to see one
		      called adolesence but it was not available...
		      maybe things will be better in chicago...to my
		      shame i did not think of anne marie when the
		      faithfull news broke - more in morin...suddenly
		      i saw i was right, in paying attention to a
		      muse or to a self, i left something so cute
		      on some shelf to collect dust as it were...not
		      that there was anything i could do or wanted
		      to do but it underlines the previously mentioned
		      irony...in this case, i had only thought that
		      lotta could learn a thing or two in terms of her
		      desire to have a bakery...yet in looking closer
		      i realize she is the only girl i have come across
		      that loves tennis...blinded by the light?
		      i did of course think of marie anne, yet in the
                      end there are no words for that kind of emotion.
		      for someone attempting to be gentle, it might
		      be viewed as intrusive...for someone avoiding
		      irony, it might be manifested by being invoked
		      through words...so wishing her well from a safe
		      distance was where i settled...what does anything
		      mean? one report spawns copycat headlines yet
		      there is no silent option, is there? so no need
		      to ask why joni was caught in the devil's bargain
		      trying to get back to the garden...i was caught
		      up in an all night investment plan, by which
		      i mean 'coin' - a couple of days ago and i suppose
		      i need more time to balance into what has
		      become my usual schedule...anyway the system was
		      merely moving one token to a new address - mostly
		      due to the fact that one place has possible earnings
		      where the other didn't...these transfers are often
		      lightning fast yet in shuffling through what are
		      named seed phrases to exctract from various installed
		      'wallets' well it is a task...still, nice to see
		      new earnings nearly instantly...i don;t expect 
		      too much from these things, the motivation is to
		      leave a substatial enough fortune for whatever
		      loved or beloved ones remain...so that they
		      need.nt be concerned by the economy. it's like
		      my stock holdings, i'm sure it will come in handy
		      further down the line...for them. 
		      <br>
		      <br>
		      ten february<br>
		      <br>
		      i had a nearly logical urge to fix up my main room
		      as i expect one of the new guitars to arrive in the
		      upcoming week or two...mission accoomplished, but
		      there is yet much to do in terms of uncluttered goals.
		      i kept thinking it was january and someone;s birthday
		      for some reason awaking today to see that emilee's
		      birthday didn't cross my mind...which might explain
		      that disaster dream wherein she seemed to be with
		      me at the liquor shop...someone had aaked for wine
		      and i looked in the fridge container for a bottle...
		      this upon the heels of literal cat nap, skirt seemed
		      to be fighting with the pigeon eating feral cat and
		      i was rushing to protect him when i noticed three
		      other cats transform, turned winged, and flying...
		      one of them turned back and looked to be stuck in the
		      metal of the back door...squeezing out slowly as i 
		      awoke...an awaking to merely freak out as a wedge of
		      orange rested at the whirpool door...the thing was
		      it felt as if someone had been there and that paranoid
		      feeling continued to creep around me even into the
		      next day...no daddy or dad wanna be is allowed into
		      the water closet, violent dream - who are these people
		      that think i am like them or that they have been invited...
		      suddenly the apartment feels like a wrestling match...
		      i feel bad over slamming his head into the wall, but then
		      as if blending scenes i wonder if someone came in and
		      slammed my head into the wall...they say it's gas,
		      bubbles in the neck...something must have happened...
		      there's been talk of real estate and i have even felt
		      the eviction sensation although it is illogical when 
		      one owns the property...no landlord, no worries in that
		      sense even if bullies want to blind the facts...then
		      again i must take into consideration how some folks
		      insanely identify with a place - buying and selling
		      it as  if souls were involved...here you go; rent out
		      my cousin or aunt...haunted or mirrored, hounded in 
		      error...perhaps that is wahy i had them chased dreams...
		      invasion of the body snatchers redux...anyway no goodly
		      dreams to report, even lotta said she had a nightmare -
		      oh wait, margaret i did dream - her eyes mystical -
		      she was dancing and it was another transformation
		      dream like josie trapped in the dresser from twin peaks
		      instead this was shiny silver metal yet i could still see
		      her eyes...i thought of the melted magnet liquid i used
		      to play with as a child...it felt childish to indulge 
		      myself in all six thin man films yet in the final 
		      evaluation there is no better series of films in terms
		      of sequels...at least not in the rom-com detective genre -
		      the thin man, after the thin man, another thin man, 
		      shadow of the thin man, the thin man goes home, and
		      song of the thin man...i simply adored them even if the
		      last one made me over think and the ending was not
		      what i expected unless i consider that they were 
		      putting the franchise to bed...uhm the overthinking
		      was about don taylor playing buddy hollis...a name
		      too near to buddy holly...his previous acting credit
		      had been 'time to kill'...a short film, preceeded by
		      'winged victory'...well, you see how that sort of
		      thing could get one's mind worked up...sure, imitation;
		      life and art...well, there's something ironic given
		      the otherwise joyful conclusions in those films...
		      myrna was not shy about playing the vixen, i viewed
		      thirteen chairs and indecent -aka, vanity fair - but
		      i think i mentioned that here already...i did want 
		      to mention emptying out the bench to bum rush the
		      opposing team in the first quarter but they got by
		      without that strategy...although i am tempted to 
		      type that the nfl was merely paying heed to public
		      sentiment...the real superbowl ie, detroit vs
		      buffalo must have been playing in the dreams of
		      true fans...now then, two skinny girls retro classic
		      slide instrumental, laudanum, will be re-released
		      any minute now...here's hoping your monday is moving
		      along happily.
		      <br>
		      <br>
		      11 february
		      <br>
		      dream said i was walking in a city beside
		      what should have been a park or garden yet
		      was much more of a forest...there were signs,
		      they indicated via insignia or logo that the
		      area i had wandered into was occupied by 
		      a military force...soon enough encountered
		      men in uniform...i carried a backpack which 
		      i haven't for some time...one of them sat me
		      down in what i think thwy call a mess hall,
		      a sort of dining area more like you would find
		      in jails or school cafeterias than actual
		      eating places...he insists on seeing what it
	              is i might have in the bag...based on the 
		      principal of privacy i argue against the search,
		      although i actually have no idea what might be
		      in there - positively something trivial given
		      my response - his response was to empty out
		      all the contents of his pockets as if to say
		      he had nothing to hide so why should i...as
		      i am about to explain my shyness, a fidel 
		      castro type saunters up behind me and leans
		      against the chair i am in sitting on - he
		      reprimands the soldier man and also mocks 
		      him insinuating he is a homosexual, meanwhile
		      i am keeping still thinking i always wanted
		      to meet fidel castro, but he then grows louder
		      remarking that he is not a homosexual yet 
		      runs off removing his pants to join the crowd
		      of soldiers that were the counterpart of the 
		      man that wanted to rifle through my belongings
		      - as if to leave the statement as sarcasm or
		      at least a question in the air of listening minds -
		      in another dream i am being driven in a vehicle
		      to what felt like some clandestine operation,
		      or even a heist...there is someone next me and
		      we are holding hands...the way children might...
		      when the destination is gained the hand holding
		      leads me in the opposite direction promising
		      to be with me all the way then suddenly disappearing -
		      at which point i find myself climbing an entrance
		      gate...ala river cartwright in france - a slow horse
		      not knowing what is on the other side...hundreds
		      of crawlers swarm the ground and i worry they
		      will get at my ankles yet they swim past as if
		      intent on leaving those grounds...i see a corridor,
		      it is glowing and my grandmother is there yet
		      as i attempt to get her attention i notice she
		      is blind and possibly deaf...she is moving things
		      around with a dancer's motion, carefree, and i 
		      move on to find the party i was with only to 
		      find myself in an apartment - peopled by more
		      than i could count much less recognize - a woman
		      now in front me seasoning meat as if trying to 
		      show me - to my left is lotta yet she is not 
		      near and in conversation with someone else - 
		      i awake remembering something about a kitten 
		      or cat that had a jack on its side and i plugged
		      in a cable the way i would with an electric guitar -
		      i stumble out of bed concerned that someone might
		      be using gadgets to pass himself off as me - 
		      a vague memory of an old galaxy android came to 
		      mind - gary  plays john cheever in the
		      film i am in the middle of but what keeps going
		      through my thoughts is how similar celeste is 
		      to margaret and thus the question of previous 
		      dream...could it have been foretelling this 
		      film or was i right in thinking it was merely
		      replaying a variation on a film i had recently
		      seen many times...there is no right answer and
		      i settle into tuesday knowing i will not know. 
		      one last thing, the scene after climbing sure
		      brought to mind the triple note by the tree
		     intimacy dream and pre-dream it was the very first time
		      i thought of anya although i had her image
		      put placed atop the inkrealm cloud space for
		      months which i switched upon the maria thought -
		      the weird part of it was that it was like being
		      cornered into a usual or habitual thought sequence
		      which was entirely foreign to me, i mean of course
		      i like and admire her yet that is not exactly
		      translated in thoughts which have been otherwise
		      engaged...later looking at her pictures i find
		      that parts of my thought sequence were even 
		      accurate, i remembered from the generation p
		      article her friend and recognition fired up 
		      within my looking eyes. in any case, alike the
		      margaret/celeste puzzle, this also has no resolution. 
		      not that i ever mind thinking of pretty girls...

		      february 12<br>
		      <br>
		      indeed, what else is there...now then to elaborate
		      on the "cloud" it is merely being grateful for the
		      inspiration i found in moscow, in saint petersburg,
		      in samara, in volgograd, yes russia...at the time,
		      history will prove the vilification of the former
		      soviet empore as if insanity prevailed in the press,
		      corporations exited, sanctions punished the innocent,
		      and everyone seemed to turn against that land...i 
		      was looking at the hermitage museum at finding
		      shostakovich was from that city...how does one 
		      explain that place...let us say some people awake
		      there thinking they are in paris france...but back
		      to the point, so the "cloud" was also a protest
		      as i feared for these girls and hoped it would 
		      help them in some way...i got up in the wee hours
		      thinking about the dream i had...a girl dressed in
		      yellow rain coat with a matching hat looked extremely
		      happy to see me...i would not find it weird except
		      i know i can sit for hours at my desk never thinking
		      of anything or anyone with any joyous greeting...
		      in any case, it seemed she kept moving from standing
		      in front of me to being a picture or video streaming
		      on one of my cell phones, at some point i picked up
		      the other one to film her...i noticed i was on the 
		      big mattress that somehow got lost...the one i had
		      wroted private area upon...it could be that someone
		      kept it instead of the story i was fed...lotta seemed
		      to feed on a hamburger and fries, later asking why
		      she was having trouble sleeping...i stumbled around
		      hoping she would get some rest - but i haven't been 
		      able to think her as i did before the christmas party -
		      it has become a sort of flip frenzy image invitation -
		      wherein other girls feel as if i am leaving them out
		      when they have every right to ask for my attention...
		      in some cases, i suppose that is true, in others it
		      might be my own fault for looking...except in all logic
		      no one can keep to one thought twenty four seven...
		      not that it really matters to her or to them...
		      it is only a high strung sensation i keep trying to 
		      tune...of course there is no correct tuning for an
		      instrument as delicate as the mind...i suppose most
		      folks would understand this in terms of faith...a
		      heavenly divinity and the multi-faced distractions
		      of sin for lack of a better word...don't get me wrong,
		      i am not actually worried. in fact i only got worried
		      while thinking of going to the bank - itself a minefield
		      of dress up and locking up this and that before arriving -
		      the worry eased upon the knowledge that i needn't hurry
		      over my deposit plan or anything related to that...
		      besides what if the expected haul arrives and i happen
		      to be not here - i continued watching the italian film
		      deciding to savour it by sections...so only halfway 
		      through...i think i miss reading and desired to return
		      to the wagner book that his wife wrote out for him...
		      it is shocking to me to have felt such a connection
		      to him in reading his word story...not as shocking
		      was feeling cosima nearly resembled lauren sophia...
		      i have other books to get to yet nothing that feels
		      urgent...they say if you took the time to look at 
		      each painting in the hermitage it would be eleven
		      years before seeing all them...i translate this notion
		      to books knowing it is important to decide which ones
		      to timeshare and perhaps especially which ones to 
		      revisit...is wagner revisiting? did i read enough
		      already? well, not if i feel this way and certainly
		      there is a second part i left for later being convinced
		      that in some ways i was reading about myself...
		      bell jar syndrome, when else does this happen, rarely...
		      lotta does not like berlin and i felt a pain in my
		      left bicep as i settled into the scale ritual...
		      somehwere in the dream both arms were in pain and
		      i sensed i was with family members but it was all as
		      vague as the fog in a hazy london evening...my wristwatch
		      had stopped in that dream i lamented having to go out
		      for the battery...it was too soon, i thought...now i 
		      think of lotta's expression, the drained social battery -
		      dsb is both a railway company and elsewhere a bank...
		      in reaction to being uncertain over which path to take,
		      i prepared and re-released "exile's letter" - thinking
		      in the future i will doulbe up on the releases and make
		      them a set of two so as to sort of match the name of
		      the band...two skinny girls - a two song album...well,
		      i;ve had worse ideas...whatever, the wristwatch was in
		      fact all right and my arms lost that bizarre sensation -
		      i should type that i feel the dsb even before getting
		      done with plans to go banking, shopping...excuse me
		      i think i want to listen to a bit of nick lowe.
		      <br>

		      13 february<br>
		      <br>
		      i needn;t explain this or that yet on the off chance
		      that somewhere clarity is required, well it's like
		      i'm speaking to myself here - there is a thing that
		      you will not be able to recollect ffrom the fleeting
		      images of dreams, from the overly populated imagination
		      later et cetera and sometimes in the act of the jot
		      i don;t pay heed to the form or even rush in typing
		      so that for example i might miss telling how the
		      resemblance is only an outline since each lady has
		      her own distinct beauty...
		      i later dreamt of arriving at a sort of crossroads,
		      it was a much broader avenue than i have ever been
		      on but from my question it would seem to have been
		      manhattan, which way is sixth avenue and having
		      learnt the path from some stranger bystander i 
		      turned to gain ground on fifth avenue...please note
		      in my experience there are parts divided by a park -
		      can't recall if sixth is literally the continuation
		      of central park west...no matter, getting there
		      i find a woman walking two lap dogs...i had reluctantly
		      started to like dogs since seeing asta who i believe
		      was played by both the daddy dog and his puppy son -
		      terribly cute...they are friendly and don't seem to mind
		      me then at the doorstep she is asking me if i am free
		      on satruday when suddenly a karla surrounded by a group
		      of girls appears behind a gate alike the tony roberts 
		      obituary picture which held woody and the holy diane
		      well karla eases into my side, i think i notice a 
		      belly piercing but i am more concernd that she is 
		      drunk and about to slide onto the ground as if melting -
		      saying you can't date her i want you with me on saturday -
		      i do not know what to say...i get up and now thinking of
		      ian hunter's central park and west along with the grateful
		      dead's one more saturday night even if the song that
		      held my attention most recenlty was a jockey full of bourbon
		      by tom waits...i suppose the music comes to mind after finding
		      a certain scale which is said to incorporate five scales
		      in one but more interesting to me was the added notes
		      which line up all the notes in any key as well as the chords -
		      that is to say pretty useful for improvisation and writing
		      if one were to keep strictly to the notes or chrods in the
		      scale...it was happenstance, someone named andrew clark,
		      so i decided to learn that, it's like a big blues and
		      eight note box with two notes on top of wherever one
		      decides to play it so key of E starts at the tenth fret
		      and so on...weird the things one misses but yeah that is
		      the only tip that made any practical sense other than
		      the very pleasant stitchmethod guitar guy that has
		      a masters degree in jerry garcia...usually there;s a 
		      lot of crowded words with little meaning so i felt it
		      right to mention them...of course to really learn i
		      would only recommend watching what john 5 does...yeah
		      it's heavy but unlike metalheads he does not shy away
		      from slowing down once in a while...in my excitement
		      i brought in the dominant pentatonic to the roster of
		      daily ritual...i don't know it yet but i that was how 
		      spent most my day...thinking well i will prolly not
		      need so many scales but going for it with the logic
		      that to continue in this fashion makes sense as every
		      time i have missed a day or two i always notice the
		      truth in what jerry said...it's like a bridge, a place
		      to gather one's self...at this juncture my only real
		      issue is the argument of speed...but i feel speedy 
		      enough when it comes down to it and i know i don't 
		      want to impose  a playing style upon myself that
		      in the end could only be useful for a few songs...
		      in that sense, perhaps it is why i only know the
		      outline of some solos without seeking to replicate
		      them...a cover band is not in my to do list...there's
		      something about substance over flash i suppose...but 
		      i've most likely said too much on the topic - 
		      i hesitate now as i struggle with the italian in the
		      film i am viewing...as if saying i understood that
		      other movie voided my roman ear...i woke up near to 
		      hunger...ordering, reluctantly, chinese food, justifying
		      the cost by thinking the leftovers will balance it out...
		      i went to sleep again after another round of scales and
		      nearly only thought about lotta...yet it is still some
		      sort of frenzy in my vision...reflected in my dream
		      running around in what must have been an airport shop,
		      strange word duty free i don't like it although not
		      as irritating as diatonic...i don't know why...uhm
		      yeah i remember trying to decide between a mint 
		      listerine and a regular one...all the while packing, all
		      the while worried that the plane was leaving without
		      me - when two suits settled in taking a eyeful of
		      my old tamrac camera case...they sat next eachother
		      on high stools...i was explaining how i could not 
		      explain how the dust gathers inside a window shut
		      room and how they might want to remove some of the
		      messy particles before going further...they looked
		      like they were from some federal agency...as if one
		      had been cloned to get a perfect partner...who could
		      argue with himself...i turned away to continue packing
		      and to check on the departure then awoke - someone 
		      i had not met had actually taken something from that
		      dusty container about the time the gas line next to
		      the stove was punctured...here's the problem with
		      being raised catholic...even in dreams one might be
		      polite or even nice to people that deserve the stark
		      opposite...it was too early to make sense of it all...
		      not that i wanted or wished to...there was a late 
		      notification that made it seem as if lotta had just posted
		      but at three in the morning...studying the matter i saw
		      it had been from eight thirty. someone on social media
		      detailed the process of vision with an emphasis on how
		      much we miss from the broad field which is reduced and
		      translated in the mind which returns it to be seen perhaps
		      understood...that might be the situation with any given 
		      guitar scale...the connections, to me feel endless, that 
		      is the potential sequence cannot be seen entirely since
		      selecting one run leaves all the other races still in 
		      place...we see a series of notes yet there are unlimited 
		      options. in any case exciting or exasperating depending
		      on one's point view. one might venture to say jerry's
		      continual search for new methods was merely limiting
		      the exasperation. hopefully that is true for myself 
		      as well, ah look valentine's day coming in soon...
		      union station kansas city missouri mass shooting
		      parade anniversary no i didn;t know it was a dj
		      that had been killed...much less by a man sharing

		      15 february<br>
		      <br>
		      dream conversation with lotta, her face looks
		      powdered, i am telling her she is fine without
		      the tanning effect...i don't hear an answer -
		      i don't get through the italian film leaving
		      the last few minutes for the second viewing -
		      i decide the film is like a dream yet i can't
		      place the actress as she, celeste i think her
		      name is feels so familiar...i come to the conclusion
		      of sonia as a last resort...i browse through the
		      reviews, they are all curving on mixed, they
		      mostly implying it is sexist...i think of the 
		      kids in the hall skit now, yes my film is a 
		      very sexist film...well, the film is once
		      in a while sensual...yet even the critics can't
		      help mentioning kubrick and lynch when speaking
		      of it...it is that visually stunning...the giant
		      laughing child of the professor that sits couch
		      potato like in front of a television is the
		      kick in the pants for me, there's no definition
		      or description that could explain those minutes
		      as it conveys so much in itself...so when the
		      beauty employs the word beautiful it is itself
		      an ending - perhpas i wanted that to be the ending...
		      although i didn't consider it until the present...
		      in stark contrast, the gorge, the next film i 
		      viewed went some ways into excitement without resorting
		      to the gimmick of nudity...although nudity has a hard
		      time being seen as trite...hell, even wardrobe malfunctions
		      make the news rounds...lotta said her legs felt naked
		      in spandex, i felt naked upon awaking yet i actually
		      was...i had dreamt of galvan - thinking how difficult
		      that type of job must be...well, like an influncer
		      always needing to be on point...the last couple of
		      times i thought about filming myself i have encountered
		      an against it sensation in the fashion of suddenly
		      not feeling presentable...spiral into rabbit hole
		      debate about being vain, self- absorbed, et cetera...
		      where was i, ah yes, i found that film thrilling if
		      only for the fact that the main characters literally
		      fell in love...not to mention the chess scene which
		      serves to remind one of the queen's gambit...now
		      then, saturday - story ideas i will not write one,
		      yao restaurant poisons writer and strangers mock
		      him for being ill... sotry ideas i will not write two,
		      publicity lawyers for democrats haggle with the 
		      new york post over the price of a feature article...
		      story ideas i will not write three, man speaks to 
		      a female relative via telephone, the relative kisses
		      her husband and the man feels the presence tingle
		      upon his lips with disgust. the triad in simple
		      terms has a minor third and diminished fifth...
		      i don't know when i first saw the crossed out
		      circle symbol or how i remembered it when seeking
		      to update the circle of fifths diagram...
		      <br>
		      <br>
		      16 february<br>
		      <br>
		      didn't i stack pants in my 3k closet, the dream
		      reminds me...or perhaps it was lauren sophia and
		      her design seven slacks...that apartment suddenly
		      a school - i am dressing, the detention lady is
		      standing tall in the hallway - i turn to look away
		      from her - emilee is behind me, smiling, smiling
		      before braces, i want to say i don;t know if this
		      is real...i get up and play scales concentrating 
		      on the dominant pentatonic, i go through the ritual
		      then slide through all the diminished chords only
		      liking some of them...i return to bed partly thinking
		      of the word be-love-d, bed love, a term helena was
		      using, there she was nearly showing her b, but i 
		      thought it weird, like a hidden hurry all very cute
		      yet clandestine...if he were you wouldn't you be
		      honoring her in your own profile...well, it is 
		      safer thataway, i suppose...what lennon said, 
		      hide your love away...i drift off to dreams
		      without giving further pause to any of it, hopefully
		      everyone is happy in their own space and time...
		      the dream then turned out to be too much for me
		      to handle...lotta had moved in and we embraced...
		      we were caught trying to decide what to eat...
		      she had had tacos in a video i viewed, rubbing
		      her belly in satisfaction as if to fuel the fire
		      within brooke...i speak out what could make a menu
		      from the stored fridge and pantry items...she pulls
		      out a fish from the freezer and then another fish,
		      one is red and full bodied, the second is a couple
		      of headless fish, some sort of filet which seemes to 
		      be her choice, standing in the kitchen i am telling
		      her that was the most wonderful hug i have ever 
		      experienced...the door rings before she responds but
		      i start to fret that she does not feel the same about
		      the embrace...a group of men stand at the entrance,
		      one handing me a guitar that is packed too lightly 
		      and the other pushing in the box i suppose i am
		      eagerly awaiting...a third man puts a box in my
		      palm, i open it as they leave but have no idea what
		      it is...the weird fate to behold and expectation
		      and not recognize it...i don't have time to spend
		      on the puzzle - wanting to return to lotta - 
		      yet somehow there are visitors in one of the rooms,
		      sister is now in the kitchen explaining the situation,
		      from a glimpse they look like some sort of boy band...
		      sister's daughter is also in the kitchen kneeling
		      in front of the stove...i hear someone at the door 
		      again and find one of the locks missing, replaced
		      by some rinky dink padlock, finally returning to
		      lotta, she explains that she didnt have the key...
		      so i don't mind it so much...yet there is another
		      knock on the door, i am starting to get suspicious,
		      men are going back and forth up and down the stairs,
		      as if trying to peer into the living room...a strange
		      man in uniform appears and everyone steps aside, there
		      is a counterpart with a similar get-up, he is almost
		      singing, announcing himself as a captain yet as he 
		      nears i notice it is a salesman, not caring for whatever
		      it is that he is peddling, i shut the door but find
		      my bedroom door ajar and one of the laptops opened...
		      inspecting it i find someone has fiddled with it and 
		      it is in the process of re-establishing itself, the
		      screen looks sleeker more modern in some way...still
		      i am upset but the boy band is rushing out before
		      i can get a word in...i reprimand my sister for
		      allowing such chaos and pour water on her daughter;s
		      head knowing it would or could dismantle her hairdo...
		      all at once it feels like a very long time has elapsed -
		      there haven't been any boy bands she knew since menudo -
		      it takes three, four hours to fly from the city to here,
		      much more from sweden...yet i get up finding it has only
		      been a few minutes...half an hour certainly no more than
		      an hour...it's the middle of the night and i don't
		      know what to do except maybe clean the kitchen which 
		      leave for later, putting it on the back burner as it were -
		      i didn't want to love lotta yet in some partly selfish
		      way i do...evaluating the scene i see myself as hyper
		      in contrast to her cool stance...i see myself as too 
		      eager to please her when possibly i should not optionize
		      in order for her to please herself...maybe it was the
		      first time we met in some other life and i was merely
		      being a kind host...the minutes crawled, an hour later
		      still no clean kitchen...scrolling through social media
		      i hear tom waits' green grass being covered by a woman
		      intent on playing it with barre chords, i want to say
		      something to her about chord shapes, but when the lyric
		      arrives at if the sky falls - mark my words, we'll catch
		      mockingbirds...i sense that the bond track was lifted 
		      from this poem...one's in C minor the other in A minor
		      while both have something identical in terms of feeling -
		      gemini flash tells me it's possible yet impossible to 
		      prove...the thought takes up another hour as i listen
		      to his recording and also a live version...i suppose
		      there is nothing to be done but even if ai disagrees,
		      i do think or to be more exact feel it was lifted...
		      in any case, or otherwise, i feel all right...i suppose
		      dreaming of her sent me miles away from loneliness,
		      set me up to even clean the kitchen in the wee hours.

		      why doesn't someone tell me about such tidbits...ps,
		      if i had to be concise about it, this particular 
		      dream scene was like kia jade's little girl picture
		      with tee that either said angel or anger and i 
		      couldn't tell if it was heavenly or mad...

		      19 february 
		      <br>
		      dreamt next to a girl, like someone i met, 
		      she is very near and i am looking at her
		      passport...it's filled with grey and green
		      holographic images, body grey, hair parts
		      greenish...none of them are clear - sort
		      of outlined, sketched and in motion, gifesque
		      as if she is dancing, a few imply nudity...
		      i pull out, from the first page, some items
		      she has stashed there, cards, a fragment of
		      an id...she in turn gives me a picture of herself
		      then of some other girl, darker like a vampire -
		      i recognize the image but vaguely...i awake
		      to no certainty, all at once distracted by my
		      waiting for the guitar and haul to arrive and
		      recollecting an earlier dream wherein a dog
		      was trying to bite me and i forced its teeth 
		      into itself, teeth like the dark girl, sharp
		      and long....to think of it that was strange
		      considering i had found something akin to 
		      affection for dogs after seeing asta and
		      son in the thin man movie series...i started
		      to watch all is well but that didn't go so well -
		      the brutalist went a bit better, yet i cannot
		      fully understand its logic...it's not direct
		      on many levels and i believe it was trying to
		      shock the audience more than once as if story
		      would not suffice...one likes it yet as it is
		      not a true story one has less to hold on to in
		      terms of liking it except for craft...in another
		      dream two fender basses have arrived, i had one
		      that came in a nice leather case which was later
		      given to a cousin...in the dream it seems to be
		      him judging it as i remove the strap for some
		      unknown reason...in retrospect i cannot say who
		      it was except the words were not in english -
		      i got concerned that someone had tried to spy
		      upon my new axe before it arrived...the only
		      thing that has arrived so far are a few roaches
		      seemingly desperate to munch upon something...
		      even skirt's milk plate...even after cloroxing
		      the floor...very strange, i had the sensation
		      they had gone through the eyes of some onlooker
		      possibly envious of the cat enjoying kfc...
		      in another dream i am once again with lotta and
		      she is saying there is a steam room in the gym
		      and they drove down...yet i awoke then to imagine
		      the rest of the sentence...sleep let me slept
		      a lot except today both anxious for her trip
		      to hamburg and a third turn at berlin as well
		      as knowing for certain the delivery could be
		      any minute now, well day time hours...so up
		      all morning then a proverbial cat nap of 
		      an hour or less afternoon...barclay is a bank
		      i think, but in a different dream i thought
		      it barque lee or so...i was at three k leaning
		      against the door perhaps holding it against 
		      intrusion...yet unlike the actual door, there
		      was a space i could see through...there was 
		      a kid there he seemed upset over living in 
		      such a place and rushed out to what looked
		      alike midtown explaining to the thin air the
		      type of building he wanted then pronouncing 
		      the barkley sounding word as if breathing life
		      into the idea...i stood there watching, something
		      appeared to be under construction yet it was reddish
		      in plastic or perhpas blow up balloon material the
		      type one finds at used cars dealerships waving whatever
		      way the wind breathes...i suppose it was one of sister's
		      kids, but an insane version. i wouldn't know...as if 
		      in response i later dreamt that i was making a call to 
		      her yet one of her exes picked up the line and i pretended
		      to have no idea who i was speaking to as i left a message
		      for her that i had telephoned. to skip back a second, 
		      berklee comes to mind...possibly in augmenting the 
		      scale ritual which is a type of construction i have inadvertently
		      laid down the foundation of something that is flimsy...
		      or someone wants me to feel that it is not built to last...
		      anyway, there is that quirky twist where the names of the 
		      scale are usually several and of course berklee varies the
		      definitions possibly in mixolydian being termed locrian although
		      i couldn't tell from memory, i label them with the common
		      name and note alternative names when interesting...speaking
		      of music, the mentioned 'laudanum' has been delayed...i did
		      not understand the question, and defined it as being the way
		      it should be, given that it had already been released...
		      however, i was informed that 'exile's letter' is now available
		      again...

		      20 FEBRUARY<BR>
		      <BR>

		      i might have regained the schedule i feel a preference for...
		      the day was decidedly weird, i watched the last showgirl -
		      while washing dishes and wrangling a steak onto a plate
		      with the dead bugs rice and a sprite...it baffles me that
		      rice does not exactly freeze...i always liked pamela because
		      there was always something gentle about her nature...yeah,
		      gentle yet carefree...this movie was not gentle and felt
		      crafted to make a specific point...billie gave it an 
		      excellent balance so even the parts one sees coming a mile
		      away don't feel so wrong in the end...it must be better than
		      i am implying since the first hour flies by in a flash - 
		      it was over before i had time to serve myself at which point
		      i returned to manhattan melodrama and man woman or teen am i
		      glad i did although i was a mess of tears at the end...
		      it should be illegal to view such fine fare from the 1930s
		      in the midst of what is being touted as terrific...neither
		      the brutalist nor the last showgirl can rival it and that is
		      truly saying something...i wanted to end the day there yet
		      restlessness had other plans...plus a call with background
		      talking took its toll in displacing me beyond pleasure - 
		      i got up from the failed nap to kill another two roaches
		      in the kitchen - i went through the scale ritual and had
		      an inclination to investigae sweep-picking, in a sense it
		      is like re-learning the entire rhythmic process, what i 
		      found is nobody tells you that it is sort of backwards or
		      inverted, that is to say - for that type of playing which
		      speeds up certain phrases - one actually is required to 
		      slow down and steady the right hand strum nearly contrary
		      to logic...i got the gist of it in one pattern but soon
		      lost the flow as if it would only show itself on a whim,
		      yet in trying it with my own invented pattern (using the
		      same limit to save strings as i do with scales) i found
		      something i rather liked but have yet to decide if adding
		      this would work for me...i might not have the patience
		      in my right hand to settle down that much...to go in the
		      opposite direction of what feels natural...when i finally
		      got to sleep the dreams did not feel natural - one aunt
		      was sitting on me and i could see myself shirtless in 
		      a mirror's reflection writhing in pain, then another
		      aunt handed me a two story frame sort of like a flattened
		      doll house...there was a devilish demon in the top box
		      seemingly passing gas right onto whover was in the lower
		      box and that party appeared cramped and filled with
		      sorrow - i believe she also handed me some money and 
		      after contemplating the bizarre duplex, i walked down
		      the hall as if going to my room but one of my uncles
		      got in the way, this getting in the way became physical
		      and i pulled off part of his nose as if it had been
		      glued on without giving it much thought and escaping
		      to my destination except of course at that point i awoke
		      thinking how weird that had been...as i write it now gogol
		      comes to mind...i guess some folks have no sense of humour-
		      although excited to see that i had partly reclaimed my
		      hours, i stayed in bed and then dreamt of three different
		      types of food...a woman stood beside either a turkey or
		      chicken, there was an enormous pot of rice, and something
		      fried...i was asking her for all three and she gave me
		      a plate containing my request - except i didn't feel like
		      myself and actually did not want to eat and didn't instead
		      surveying the surrounding areas of the scene as if trying
		      to pin down who had pinned me down in such a mundane or
		      perhaps fat man;s dream...this all turned into watching
		      some sort of masturbation with someone hidden wherein all
		      i could see was a dragonfly emerging from a penis, repeatedly
		      well i told you it was a weird day...anyway yeah dragonflies
		      swimming out and flying...needless to say i was baffled and
		      awoke then, still sort of early and hopefully early enough
		      to get back on track...in pre-dream sequence thought i did
		      feel a squirting of sperm without motive or movement and 
		      the surprise of that moment possibly was the impetus of the
		      scene...that sounds strange uhm the origin of the species no
		      that would be worse, the catalyst of such confusion...burroughs
		      said he could will himself to ejacualte without using touch -
		      didn't think it was true until now. i don't want to ejaculate
		      via thought and or thoughtlessness although i do wish i could
		      conjure the delivery of my new guitar and haul just like that.

		      21 february<br>
		      <br>
		      post- dream realization...maria has a dragon tattoo on the side
		      of her torso...it's like angelina's tiger except that is on her
		      back...the day went by mostly expecting the delivery which has
		      yet to arrive...at the end of it, after being enchanted by the
		      early parts of the western named the plunderers, i sat down 
		      confident into the ritual and then a second attempt at this
		      backwards method but when i got through the scales, it was
		      like being at the start...i was perplexed after coming up
		      with a self-invented pattern that played near perfect, there
		      i was trying to figure out how i had done it...the only difference
		      was that i had been sitting on the sofa whereas now i was on
		      the english dinning chair i continually borrow from the table...
		      it couldn't be that i said to myself putting the axe back to its
		      resting position...of course curiosity took hold and i tried it
		      again on the sofa without success...it reminded me of my 
		      struggle when i need to record a vocal without playing guitar -
		      which more often than not requires that i at least hold the
		      guitar going through the chord changes without ringing them up -
		      needless to say, i was highly anxious to give it another go
		      upon waking and yes in both seated positions, and no i did 
		      not get that wild groove that i thought was cool enough to 
		      continue the method...i am entirely not sure what it means,
		      my instinct tells me to keep at it and record to see if i
		      am simply not hearing the thing right...it is kinda quick...
		      in any case it might be that the weirdness continues...
		      in my dreams, i was directed to a room, it felt like a hotel,
		      i went into the room...three people on a bed...like a family,
		      a mother on the right side of a father and a grown daughter
		      on the left side...i could tell they were actors yet i cannot
		      say who they were...i neared to glimpes the father's forehead
		      which held little font letters typed...alike film credits or
		      studio branding - touchstone pictures...maybe since i was
		      near to anxiety over the guitar glitch, i now postulate that
		      some studios have robots in place all ready for extra work
		      and who knows what else...we'll save a fortune on catering...
		      dream going shopping and seeing sister buy a pineapple...
		      dream again in the living room except now there are dead
		      people there - that is in reality, in the scene it all looks
		      as if real time natural except for the dogs...the dogs race
		      through the kitchen and two of them remain at the back gate
		      door looking back in - like double omen german pinchers...
		      the woman is berating me over my diet and the man is being
		      no help - i try to answer either that i have never had 
		      much desire to have any meal or that i take vitamins in 
		      case my eating habit is not balanced...i got up then not
		      at all feeling easy, as it was more like meeting imposters
		      posing in bully disguise...i recall another scene, finding
		      a replica cell on the floor and turning it on then contrasting
		      it with the one on my desk...a boy stands next me nearly
		      annoying and squirming the way boys do when they need to 
		      pee, i tell him the bathroom is down the hall and thankfully
		      he leaves...i suppose i was shocked at not
		      finding the groove i thought i had learnt...retrograde?
		      a differnt me that missed that method meeting? perhaps
		      merely invisible intrusion breaking up my concentration...
		      well at least this western is one script that even licked
		      some of the actors - good golly, there is some great writing
		      in some of the lines of those early scenes. it's gotta be
		      one of the batman scribes, i think to myself. sioux teepee,
		      well it would have licked me too.

		      <br>
		      that photo play was wroted by bob barbesh who did some
		      tv work although not the caped crusader...the film held
		      no further fine lines but it did have a cute twist...
		      i was pondering over the feeling or lack thereof regarding
		      native americans when out of nowhere i heard leonard peltier
		      had been finally released...also, to be clear i'm pretty
		      serious about that sixties show having wonderful writing;
		      "i'm not just pussyfooting around this time," - catwoman.
		      holy hole in the doughnut, what happened - asked robin...
		      i was playing the intended riff on the tenth fret instead
		      of the ninth where it belonged, but then i started to weigh
		      and worry over my right hand technique...i hadn't thought
		      about it since jerry said he simply held the plectrum like
		      a pencil which is exactly how i styled my strumming...yet
		      in researching the matter, i found this terminology...scalpel
		      picking, sorad picking...some insist that pulling the thumb
		      into play and angling the plastic is the way to go - it looked
		      like a good idea until some others insisted that this type
		      of torture will kill your thumb after repeated playing...
		      a riddle a day keeps the riddler away? i did chance upon
		      a good reminder of something i was only partly conscious of;
		      keeping the thing as near to the playing area as possible...
		      i studied some chet atkins and decided from all the sources
		      that i had to allow my wrist more flex instead of forearm
		      which is usually where i feel a strain...the thing that
		      strikes one about chet and even john 5 is the ease with 
		      which they transition from floating through the strings
		      to picking...as i returned to give some of these ideas
		      a go, i found - perhaps too quickly - that i don't want
		      to hold the plectrum with my index finger as indeed i
		      hold writing instruments between thumb and middle finger -
		      the scalpel or sorad way is much easier on the forearm
		      but i sensed pretty soon that it pressured my shoulder - 
		      also it seems too much thinking would be required to 
		      swiftly turn away from these inner curved hoverings
		      to say chord work...so no new ground gained yet in being
		      more aware of the action of the plectrum hand i feel
		      improved - not necessarily faster and positively not
		      near to an expert sweeping although without effect and
		      without muting i can see where i am making it more difficult
		      than it has to be...most people doing are employing distortion,
		      and many of them also mute by way of palm...i guess the great
		      thing about all this would be keeping my self learning...
		      indeed i was too self-confident and or set in my ways in 
		      terms of the guitar...
		      funny thing, due to atkins, i fixed one of those ring style
		      plectrums on my thumb and it was like magic...like an instant
		      return to where i thought i had reached...still, i don't like
		      the clamp feeling and do not intend to fingerpick...it was
		      what i first learned, and have some dexterity plucking that
		      way yet i really don't enjoy the sensation of it...
		      strange dream, girl posing for a picture, one of her tits
		      exposed yet she was curved in such a way that it was in
		      the shadows...i wanted to look but i didn't want to be
		      obnoxious and awoke wondering if she thought i was 'staring'...
		      sauntering in another dream through intricate pathways
		      of a hotel that had different elevators for specific areas,
		      it's me and possibly lotta or at least in my mind it was -
		      we arrive at the end of one of the elevator's top floors
		      yet still need to go up stairs, a penthouse, one would imagine,
		      there were very nicely carved wood doors leading to a bridge
		      like corridor filled with supplies for the guest rooms...
		      she was walking ahead of me through a maze of pink satin...
		      stacks of them, pillows or perhaps cushions...suddenly i 
		      am in front, another set of doors, i am reaching to see
		      if i have a key card at the sound of someone speaking about it
		      but find only what seems to be an id card in my backpocket -
		      there is a lap dog behind the doors and it starts to pee
		      foward more like a fountain than a canine...i see her nearing
		      except now being carried in a sitting position by a man
		      i don't recognize...she is resting on his left arm and he
		      his steps show no sign of effort...there is joy in her eyes
		      when she catches sight of me...a hotel maid is collecting
		      items from the room and i am now reminded of mila in some
		      movie i felt neutral about - maybe it wasn't lotta and
		      maybe i was only wishing it was - then who...well that
		      mystery has no answer presently...i got up then to give
		      practice to my research which you already have the conclusions
		     from in the earlier section of this scribbled thought-note...
		      swimming through emotional seas over what the scene might
		      have implied or meant i finally settled down and dreamt 
		      again - it was a race, i mean people were running and i was
		      too, i was running in the middle of them...it was not like
		      here with the race to see a lover, it was more like central
		      park except i believe i have only jogged in riverside park
		      which is really by a river whcih becomes clearer as one
		      goes down from the university area into the 80s and then 70s
		      where it seems to end at a pier...sometimes there were boats -
		      no matter, in this dream there was none of that and no one
		      i knew exactly...simply people running - a couple of them
		      speaking about a witch or witchcraft - a woman races ahead
		      and appears to be explaining something about the columbians
		      or maybe it was the venzuelans - either way it didn't make
		      sense and still doesn't although it does give further meaning
		      to 'everybody's talkin' which i heard a few minutes ago...
		      <br>

		      23 february<br>
		      <br>
		      in the middle of a starman bowie nostalgic sensation, as
		      lazarus yet entrances my senses...the prelude sentence
		      is a quasi-apology in case this note makes not enough
		      sense...i'd been up a while trying to remember what i
		      was shooting at in some earlier dream then deciding it
		      must have been a mix up with some model talking about
		      shooting and my inner child with plastic green soldiers
		      went playing...i wasn't really sure what to do as i 
		      sat and pondered...i was very happy that lotta had had
		      a goodly great time with her friend...as for the concert,
		      what struck me was how gracie's strumming seemed like
		      a bird flapping in opposition to my idea about steadying
		      the arm and such - so being sort of
		      content until i found no one had mentioned wolf man was
		      a julia film, i didn't do much except create a new
		      design for one of the domains, mourn the story of
                      kadance...look here i'm in heaven the song tells -
		      fredickson i can't figure out why the name sounds
		      so familiar to my ears...mind's eye started a new
		      series of art posters in pin up style...i was pleased
		      with my persistence as gemini said no people i superimposed
		      the desired effect...square used to be slang for nerds...
		      squared away then thinking again of how to balance the
		      names of scales...amazed myself in not recognizing the
		      flamenco scale...perhaps i was drowsy by then, how cute
		      i thought only to realize it is the self same scale as
		      the jewish...more commonly phrygian, but also freygish...
		      circle of fourths furnished usually as fifths...
		      "A fifth of whiskey he could knock it away -
                        I drink some more and it's judgment day"
		      a hiatt song dylan covered with a blitz clapton solo -
		      years i ago i read a short story about some dude driving
		      with bob in a car that went off the cliff into a lake,
		      the narrator worried over drowning that great american
		      songwriter...i realized that might be the root of my
		      mext dream as i sort of identified with it at the time,
		      like the neil solo in chrissie;s down the wrong way -
		      the adf is projected to gain twenty percent of the vote
		      which is double what they got previously...i got wolf
		      man and hope to enjoy it later with a sandwich and
		      chips...burroughs had a datsun, i don't think mick
		      actually drives yet he was behind the wheel in my
		      dream and i kept glancing at him and then at the
		      road ahead in a concerned motion...you know some
		      people simply should not drive...i was asked once
		      if i drove and drunkenly i said yes of course - they
		      gave me the keys to some car and the task was to 
		      move it from the street into a parking garage - 
		      alternate side of the street parking madness - 
		      i still cannot explain how i managed it, everything
		      was fine which i suppose further proves my theory
		      that a lie can become the truth or the power of faith -
		      where am i going with this? i don't even know it's
		      automatic it's typing itself in a sense...in the
		      dream i arrive at a decidedly western town - as if
		      having gone back in time to settler days - dust
		      hovering on the unpaved avenue - i'm looking at it
		      perhpas feeling the anachronism...a swarm of mice
		      and crawling insects rushes through the place i 
		      stood - the scene from herzog's vampyre came to 
		      mind - kinski brushing away ganz...keith looking
		      at me like someone that had seen it all before...
		      i awoke feeling highly congested - shaking head
		      to clear nose - i drift back to sleep without
		      dreaming...awaking to laura sophia informing me
		      she lost her hair tie while on a sunday run...
		      i puzzle over the implications and or meaning -
		      my erection taking more than the left over coffee
		      and marlboro golds to subside...when i peed it 
		      felt like i was standing there for half an hour -
		      so there is a difference when one is let us call it
		      hydrated...i blame lotta's bottle but i am not
		      bothered...it's likely better to drink more water
		      than less...the rumour is that the expected haul
		      might arrive tomorrow, monday...i have made a
		      resolution to not party without miss mecey and
		      so needless to say if there is revelry she is
		      invited. excuse me now, i need to eat, care 
		      for the plants, and dedicate a couple of hours
		      to miss garner.

		      24 february<br>
		      wolf man was not good, it was great...a howling
		      time...i got so excited i brought in two socks
		      from dances with wolves for the list art...
		      too great to sleep...i stayed up way late even
		      knowing that i should have been up early...then
		      i kept sleeping even past noon...i had deployed
		      my new vision of the site redesign and it mostly
		      a smooth process...it was my first time trying
		      deepseek, that via websim, and i liked how intuitive
		      it was yet each update took more time than usual
		      and i turned to anthropic's claude so as to put
		      it all together...minutes later, all i needed to 
		      do was add a few more elements but everything
		      worked and albeit yet a work in progess, i am 
		      enjoying it...i was not enjoying the news of
		      a slanderer being given an award by sag yet
		      later thought perhaps it is a put on, a joke...
		      i did love that demi won which felt like other
		      people understood the film as groundbreaking
		      in terms of genre...one might classify it as
		      a horror film or even another category like i
		      think the golden globes did, but it really
		      transcends all that in a sense establishing
		      itself like a forerunner for what follows it - 
		      my pre-dreams were crowded, something lotta
		      had said seemed to trigger a sort of chain
		      reaction...as the light rose, i knew my 
		      intended plan to be awake in case the haul
		      came in was out of the question - still, in
		      asking at the afternoon curve i was informed
		      that wouldn't be today...manifest destiny?
		      in a dream, a woman, i am not sure who, touches
		      my torso, her hands under my shirt sliding
		      this way and that, she is saying terribly nice
		      things to me...yet in not recognizing her, i
		      did not feel the emotions or excitement one
		      would expect...i like the song love the one
		      you're with yet in practical terms and it
		      seems in dreams or at least this one love
		      or even lust needs to be placed with a specific
		      person, otherwise it would be like that - her
		      getting lovey dovey gooey and me going how did
		      this happen...my silence in the dream preceeded
		      a series of scenes i do not at all recall - 
		      i know i was dreaming but i suppose my thoughts
		      were fully distracted, occupied with the worry
		      that i would miss the delivery thus extending the
		      wait, with lotta's trip back to sweden, with
		      knowing i had to clean the cat litter but didn't,
		      with another 'moderated' note which i later found
		      was over the 'album' cover art...i didn't want to
		      get into it and switched nora barnacle for some
		      1920s dublin church photo...my apologies to jimmy
		      as i feel certain he wroted that poem for her in 
		      his chamber music songs...at least for a while she
		      was on the cover of my goldenhair...weirdly in 
		      experimenting with strumming styles, i notice that
		      the lead work in that track must have been partly
		      a sweeping motion to get that trill - i remember
		      wanting to use a certain pattern of notes and must
		      have hesitated the strum while quickly trying to 
		      fret the right notes - i say this to myself noticing
		      how similar that was to finding that sweeping groove
		      and then having difficulty recreating it...not that
		      this a preoccupation no, since i don't sit around
		      later practicing the song after recording, it makes
		      sense...now later down the line if ever put place
		      together a song and then start practicing it only
		      to find some difference or difficulty in rhythm well
		      then i might have something to seriously consider...
		      based on the scale ritual i don't think it will be
		      a concern, beyond that once you learn a song it is
		      like a part of you...nearly impossible to forget like
		      some say about riding a bike, the balance simply 
		      returns out of nowhere even years later...why am i 
		      rambling on about this...nevermind, i didn't mean
		      to make a simple point into an extended paragraph...
		      prancing into the final stretch, i think of the 
		      line from kansas city, son of a bitch talks more
		      than i do...i light a cigarette, i recall someone
		      in the dream grabbing my left forearm and trying
		      to lead me somewhere - vague details no one i 
		      knew yet later memory said spence school cross
		      walk where the girls seemed to adore me but the
		      man grabbed me in that dream fashion except trying
		      to lead me away...i;ve lead myself away from the 
		      logic of this note...my point was to underline
		      how that film, wolf man, would make an excellent
		      starting point to study the wolves in film...but
		      also how it signals back to the logic of crocodiles
		      which is also named immortality...still, i am either
		      not quick or smart enough to see if i am right much
		      less to make connections that are sensible - anyway
		      it should be enough, even for my quizzing mind, to
		      say that it was an unexpected surprise...indeed, very
		      cool. 
		      <br>
		      <br>
		      25 february<br>
		      <br>
		      i followed through on my plan, getting to sleep on time
		      despite having woken up only a few hours before...
		      i had been thinking about leni without a specific reason
		      or intent...well she was in lotta's video - then i dreamt
		      about lotta, this time nearly certain that it was her -
		      except it was in a most unexpected setting...a laundromat,
		      we were speaking and she had her back to me as if making
		      the sure washer was washing or the dryer was drying...
		      she was telling me that i was incorrect about her, that
		      most likely i wouldn't like her really or much less love
		      her...it was about the way she looked, i fixed my response
		      upon what i felt was certain yet i don't know why i was
		      touching her hair and face with such familiarity...if i 
		      met anyone it would not be in my plan to be so instantly
		      intimate ...she was dressed casually yet in a circled
		      reflection on one of the machines i could see her vaguely
		      or in some blurry manner without clothes which confused me
		      as it seemed contrary to the point of the dream if in fact
		      there was a point at all... i suppose i woke up then trying to convince her
		      of her own beauty and wondering over the reflection...
		      i sensed it would still be too early 
		      to start spending the day awaiting the expected delivery -
		      i drifted back into dreams with a sort of surprise close
		      up erotica as if i had gone down on some girl...pulling my
		      head back to peek at her pussy with a redness one does not
		      find in the common colors one encounters...some would say
		      pink, i don't know, i don't think so...pink flowers always
		      seem lighter to me...what i do know is only the devil has
		      more names than the vagina...as i turned to find out who
		      it might be or where i was in the dream, it all shifted into
		      another type of intensity wherein i was back in three k - 
		      in the main room before the furniture had been moved and
		      before mother rebuilt that antique dresser...father or perhaps
		      his ghost was going to bed but where mother usually slept -
		      there's someone with me i cannot see and i mention the placement
		      as if it were a scene i am directing, then like an actor or
		      maybe an obedient spirit, he moves to the other side, in a 
		      drunken slide motion - i feel a sense of comfort knowing
		      things are in place - then in the blink on an eye the bed is
		      crowded, there are kids there, not children, yet i am sure
		      not adults...they all seem hyper as if he were haunting them -
		      restless yet neither at play nor leaving like they are all
		      stuck there...i awake feeling weird over the vision - the
		      news tells of a bridge collapse in south korea...three dead,
		      i thought of mother's illogical and nearly hysterical arguments
		      over matters so trivial that their memory cannot be conjured
		      and how i wished i would have sensed her senility instead of
		      anger or trying to match insults...later the news reveals four
		      dead...the remnants of three k are in four d...it was about
		      two in the morning...bitcoin was making a scene yet i was not
		      inclined to think too much about it...i sensed a probing query
		      as if something or someone needed my reaction to father's
		      passing again, yet it would or will have to suffice once more
		      that there is none...the algorithm extends into chet atkins
		      videos as i find him saying everytime he looks in the mirror
		      he thinks of his father...i had taken out the hallway bathroom
		      mirror the other day...as if indeed the answer comes before the
		      question...then further, mariia ariia posted pictures of flowers
		      her father had sent and hse had settled into frame...
		      lotta says she does not have daddy issues, but i reckon we all do -
		      mashed potatoes and eggs, i was overtaken by hunger...morning without
		      mourning was rising, possibly it was lunch time in sweden...i plan
		      on staying up the next nine hours in wait unless i hear otherwise
		      or if by luck it arrives earlier than that...it all makes the day
		      feel much longer to be aware of what is missing as the minutes
		      tick away as if one were on a job...maybe it's how skirt feels
		      when i go to bed and tell him to watch the perimeter...hopefully
		      this will give me a chance to update some art in the film list
		      i have been planning yet waiting for a perfect feeling like
		      yesterday with julia...
		      
		  post script, there is was again the road to hell paved with goodly
		      intentions...late in the morning all my inspiration and 
		      desire to put place this or that here or there and even
		      anything else went into the not so wonderful wasteland of worry -
		      i will need to contain my sorrow as well as explain the
		      circumstances and situation as i am both too emotional 
		      to be coherent and also it would be wiser to wait until
		      hopefully i am proven wrong in this case...

		      having settled down in the afternoon, i went to sleep early
		      but found myself nearly chained by wrong number call i had
		      received...imagine racing to the phone expecting the courier
		      to say they are their way only to have to be reminded of 
		      someone you don;t necessarily even want to think of...
		      it was an unsettling type of bizarre...still, i struggled
		      out of the icky sensation dreamt...

		      awaking about two hours later debating on having coffee
		      or not...i would need to sleep a bit more in order to
		      allow myself to wait around again tomorrow which in fact
		      feels as if it had already started...

		      i was in a city, most likely a foreign place i had not
		      been to, at least not yet, at least not outside of dreams -
		      i'm with someone but i can't see them and we are standing
		      outiside some sort of quaint shop trying to get in but
		      it is as if we worked there...there is one of those rolled
		      down metal gates part way up implying someone was inside 
		      already - i try to look at who the person with me is but
		      i still can't tell - a man comes up to us placing two
		      dollars in single bills or maybe three, yes i think it
		      was three dollars and eighty five cents - the change in
		      dimes mostly and a few nickels...he is asking for cigarettes -
		      i look at scattered empty packs and find one that isn't
		      tampered with handing it to him...so perhaps in the dream
		      it is a tobacco shop like ezra pound wanted instead of
		      the pressures of writing poetry - now i consider it more
		      likely than someone searched my messy trash bag outside
		      and was excited by the marlboros although i doubt i would
		      throw away a fresh pack - anyway there are now a stack of
		      things at the entrance and the gate is rising...we are picking
		      them up and i notice one of them is a money box - i have
		      a sudden temptation to chisel a few bills from the top but
		      i walk in with it intact, hmm with its content intact -
		      then i am no longer there but again with lotta at a cafe
		      bar where the waitress suggests some type of mixture with
		      two different drinks, soft drinks, one of them coca cola
		      and the other some sort of tangy lime fizz...i mix them
		      differently know she likes coca cola more than i do - 
		      we sit there and the surroundings feel calm the air
		      pleasant yet when i turn to pay the wallet i pull out
		      is the brown one i possibly overused a few years go...
		      there is no currency in it except the bills from the
		      time i had carried around with me - somehow as i am 
		      explaining the irony to the cashier a magazine materializes
		      in my hands and the price on it is seven dollars so
		      i offer it as payment, it would be more than enough
		      and with a vow to pay the check anyway upon my return -
		      in the dream i did not return instead finding myself 
		      in some sort of party - lotta had checked into the 
		      stadshotell which i estimated at twenty minutes from
		      her house...but the scene was at some apartment, me
		      and a handful of very happy people who handed me
		      george w bush in a basket in which he sat in lotus
		      position as i then carried him trying to find the
		      right place for this presidential container that
		      would otherwise have been a floral arrangement...
		      i kept turning and looking for approval but awoke
		      with my left bicep aching...i thought briefly of
		      another anya who was happy to have a free evening -
		      i thought of lotta and soon after found she had
		      made a second video channel...'it was simply
		      a secondary personal phone' the punchline from
		      last year i never understood the hype over...
		      meanwhile we were all being swindled by democrats...
		      of course i am going to make coffee even if the
		      sprite is halfway swallowed...i;ve already unwrapped
		      a pack of marlboro and wroted this note in the hopes
		      of distracting myself for what i concerns me about 
		      domani as the italians tell it...i will haunt myself
		      for a little while and hopefully keep time with my
		      wanted schedule.

		      my apologies for the mystery, but everyone should
		      already know that timing is crucial and i don't 
		      wish or want to jinx the next day by a word tantrum.
		      <br>
		      <br>
		      27 february <br>
		      <br>
		      how did it go...three women found dead in belize...
		      trachtenberg...hackman, wife, and dog found dead
		      in new mexico...it's gene i was thinking about 
		      a minute ago...realizing how it really is like
		      losing a part of the family...i love him for the
                      fact that a couple of his films made mother so
		      happy...now then, my word tantrum would have been
		      how my sister in a bonehead act went and shipped the haul
		      with the same folks that made us wait months
		      to deliver the goods last year...obviously why
		      i was so worked up with worry expecially since the
		      guitar was involved, in fact two guitars...the
		      other one sent out a week after...i must have
		      walked to the balcony view several dozen times,
		      before finally deciding to give up and give in
		      to sleep...it had been a very long day except
		      for a conversation with rachel, well possibly
		      rachel, since people have been known to pose
		      or pretend to be rachel chaleff for reasons i
		      cannot fathom...further into that last waiting
		      hour i got a call saying the package would be
		      arriving in half an hour...forty five minutes
		      later indeed it got here...i couldn't believe
		      it as i sat eating chessmen cookies instead
		      of a substantial meal for dinner...i waited
		      until morning to break out the axe...everything
		      seemed more or less in order but the pick guard
		      appeared a bit worn...it wasn't in plastic like
		      the pickups or the headpiece triangle...still,
		      a beautiful six string - for a while i was
		      more into the ernie ball everlast plectrums
		      and how the new slide fit my fret hand...i 
		      placed the shirley jackson id and the cover
		      of we have always lived in the castle stickers
		      between the pickups and under the part where
		      the strings from sort of a mini-harp...the more 
		      i looked at it the more i liked it - i even started
		      to dismiss the mess in my thoughts which found them
		      entangled with the delivery man upon going to sleep
		      and then again upon waking...so that i didn't even
		      remember my dreams...i hope it was that he was thrilled
		      by my very generous tip along with the potato chips 
		      and soft drink i gave him in the hopes that the other
		      guitar gets here carefully and before long - previously i had dreamt of
		      brooke who wears tattoos i remembered her first one
		      was dopamine chemical element and the last one i saw
		      was the pizza slice bicep...in the dream she has
		      on under one of her eyes like a an initial of a 
		      signature...the scene came to mind when talking
		      to rachel, happens to be brooke's sister's name too,
		      i thought of her umbrella photos and how she had
		      blood splattered beneath one eye...anyway i suspect
		      the cool thing about the rhoads jackson is how it
		      seems to urge one to play and explore the "lower"
		      frets, that is below the twelth...i've never experienced
		      that although i have yet to get it in tune and really
		      play it...i had also got a red strap but i feel now it
		      does not match...filling out the warranty i notice it
		      is guaranteed by fender, i suppose why they call it 
		      fender special run...i also notice how easy the waterman
		      feels...i got a few other things notably pepsi but i 
		      don't want to sound like i'm rejoicing or something -
		      if you feel tempted into envy or even sneering simply
		      say inky had to wait until february for his christmas...
		      my apologies if anyone was expecting all the details -
		      the rolling stones were correct you can't always get what
		      you want...i did get lotta's new english video venture
		      finding i had been pronouncing her name incorrectly
		      all these days and nights...i now pronounce you misaccentuation
		      and influencer...i knew the title of the clash's koka kola
		      yet doubted my own mind thinking who would name a song koka kola...
		      well two skinny girls called the song they we wroted with emilee
		      counterrevolutionaires which is up for re-release asap...i thank
		      rachel, chaleff not pufky, for the motivation in getting that
		      done. ps, those higher frets or lower as i call them are
		      more meaningful to me having spent more than a few minutes
		      on the acoustic wishing it were easier to get to say the
		      fifteenth or seventeeth fret when i only had the martin
		      to work with...wish me luck and pray for gene's soul to 
		      rest in peace alongside his wife and puppy, 
		      the world has lost a powerhouse.
		      <br>
		      <br>
		      six march
		      <br>
		      i am tempted to actually revamp these notes and make this
		      a new starting point...it is wednesday and i remember -
		      with a certain degree of lament how weird sunday had
		      been...i suppose my own fault for thinking it would be
		      good to wait until monday to jot down the thoughts
		      that were jumping like improvised jazz in mind...
		      besides it was was the oscars and although i wouldn;t
		      be watching i figured it better not to make waves
		      against whatever that was or would be...i also felt
		      i had to wait and see what lotta meant by her deployed
		      jittery video which seemed intent on skipping past
		      the events she had pointed to earlier in the week -
		      notably le boheme at some opera house in sweden - 
		      i went to sleep partly pissed that someone yet again
		      was shouting at the exterior entrance of the building -
		      although i quickly dismissed the sound being self involved
		      within my self and all the things i had wanted to note
		      here it felt later, as i awoke, to have have shaken
		      up my peace...i had no precise dream memory and the 
		      next day a series of scenes were recalled which blended
		      into a blur each one lasting only a few seconds...i 
		      would term it a sort of imposed insanity much like that
		      senseless giddy feeling when the mind swirls without
		      any warmth in its journey - a cold hilarity that haunts
		      whatever tranquility follows...even lotta felt very far
		      away...at which point i was borderline angry - then
		      the market called claiming they couldn't get the smokes
		      i like...i was like great in the sarcastic sense and
		      settled the locks on the doors to purchase them elsewhere -
		      i picked a place that i had been to once before, the
		      customer service girl that looks like cristal...i couldn't
		      believe later that i felt her attraction but chalked it
		      up to my own skewed version of events...or perhaps it
		      was really cristal as that would make more sense...but
		      my idea was to smoke...the other cigarettes arrived too,
		      yet lotta kept feeling more distant - i had been sort
		      of upset by the fact that demi faced the irony of 
		      life imitates art by being - what most sensible folks 
		      term - robbed of her rightful place in a sense by a
		      younger type woman...still, the fact that the slanderer
		      didn't win thrilled me, filled me with hope...as did
		      my research into the jackson flying v - yes i keep looking
		      at other guitars to buy - but only out of a mood that
		      is inclined to not get sucked into social media scrolling
		      or go topsy turvy browsing through porn in those times
		      wherein it mistakenly feels as if i have nothing to do -
		      or playing the chess app loses its charm - but that
		      guitar felt, despite the fact that i have yet to plug it
		      into the amp, like nothing i have experienced, like a
		      revelation, like new pathways were suddenly opened, yeah
		      i liked it but after really getting a sense of it i love
		      it...even if i were willing to spend the money on a 
		      gibson, i would still take the jackson because of the
		      frets...the katana or whatever its called ends at 22...
		      the sensation i got with the jackson was that i had
		      two sets of frets. oh and the strings that came with
		      it feel exceptional which itself hints at how the
		      choice of wound might make further magic...i started
		      calling her shirley and wrapped her in my robe until
		      the case arrives...i have set up the amp to play but
		      have not found a nice enough moment to turn it on -
		      i continue my ritual on the ibanez which i never named
		      but i suppose by logic it would be nicole - not making
		      much progress on the sweeping but some improvement
		      yet it struck me that the source of inspiration for
		      the exploration, meaning jerry garcia, did not play
		      in that style...not even tapping either, to think of
		      it...so i ask myself is insisting on expanding into
		      that area contrary to my goal...my instinct tells me
		      it is even if the idea is to learn not emulate or
		      imitate...i sort of enjoy doing it even if i do not
		      have the so called practice habit...and i worry that
		      it might not be instinct but merely being lazy...
		      also do i need to impress myself in that way? 
		      dream of man in gold mask alike eyes wide shut pointing
		      awaking nearly in palpitations...
		      i was not, turning to other thoughts, not impressed
		      by the reaction in the media to the meeting held
		      in the white house recently, the actor puppet who
		      made the z war what it is really sat there and
		      threatened the united states, oh you don't feel it
		      now but you will...then people were being critical
		      of the president for standing up to this bloodthirsty
		      clown...shocking. i hope there is a another confrontation
		      with the one question, where did all the money go?
		      i watched dead money, it was a trip and i was especially
		      happy that the actress was not treated like an object...
		      i also didn;t object to hagen and in fact started thinking
		      hey i actually know what most of the words mean...with
		      some effort i could easily be fluent in german...of course
		      like the italian, my knowledge felt fading upon hearing
		      faster talk...location is everything might be the only
		      truth - living near folks that spoke beyond one's learnt
		      language would obviously turn the tide in a sense...but
		      that is an argument for schools i suppose - i did suspect
		      vicious was going to be too much for me so i skipped through
		      it even if one of the actors amazed me by a sort of alchemy
		      i have only ever felt with zelda adams...romy gevers...
		      all at once emilee and lotta clearly envisioned at her
		      countenance here and there...before that strange sunday
		      love removal machine yelling, i had dreamt i was on a
		      double date - me and emilee with another couple - it
		      looked to be a plain room and all four us were about
		      to have sex - i remember feeling her right tit and
		      finding it unusual - as if sloped...looking over at
		      the other couple i asked her to wait, i didn't feel
		      right, like it was sleazy somehow...no idea who or 
		      why - maybe someone trying to go back into the
		      recent past...perhaps my own nostalgia, in any case
		      she was very cool and did not insist on fucking - 
		      so we walked a bit quietly and i got up...got up
		      feeling it had indeed been no dream at all - a
		      printed memory...weird. weirder still is the
		      strange sensation as the week continues that in 
		      thinking of lotta i am confronted and confused by
		      other women...i don't know the reason or how this
		      might be resolved...on the surface everything seems
		      the same and she is going to paris on friday...yet
		      the feeling is now foreign...dream unusual scene,
		      i get up from bed to pee, flush the toilet and it
		      goes backwards overflowing then flooding the floor -
		      there is a girl here or wherever that might have
		      been - distinctly two rooms - one with an air conditioner
		      neither of them anything to go on about, plain...there
		      are perfumes on one mattress, i pick one up trying
		      to read the label but i am also pretending to be nice
		      to perhaps get laid...but suddenly as if reflecting
		      what has been disturbing my thoughts lately, my sister
		      is there and thus the dream has no resolution - another
		      scene another woman is fixing sculptures, well carvings,
		      wooden - in the dream i think of laura sophia's ladder -
		      yet there is no clarity - meaningless, helpless, i have
		      no clue as if staring at an out of focus abstract work
		      of art - it could be this or that...not like lara,
		      recognized and accounted for yet that scene told no story
		      except seeing her...a cosmic sort of cosima - i heard
		      some story about a private mission to the moon...i was
		      re-reading we have always lived in the castle for the
		      sake of my new guitar, the jackson not the kramer - and
		      in the early part the narrator speaks of freeing her
		      mind by setting up shop on the moon...oh wait there
		      was a horrific lady in the plain room scene, she was
		      touching my face and chest and i was pleading with the
		      other girl to get her away from me - i can still sense
		      the greed in that touch...imagine to want so badly
		      to be caressed and instead encounter such a scene - 
		      i've made a note of EWS yet presently i cannot recall
		      what i meant to shorthand...sometimes one hears something
		      that drowns out logic...the implication that a big time
		      university, which i know owns plenty of real estate, has 
		      no dorms  - sends a storm into the mind...of course i
		      myself too often speak or even write without weighing
		      everything but i don't want to go into a rant as this
		      feels like it also pulls at one of my screenplays and
		      that is obviously another story in itself - the alessi
		      jug fell out of the fridge and later as i thought about my
		      grandfather, it happened to be the anniversary of his death,
		      i wondered...now, i connect it clearly to carrying that
		      silver tray crowded with drinks for sister and her brood
		      years ago here then feeling as if grandmother had yanked
		      my arm not wanting it used to serve someone in that tribe -
		      tribute to spirituality, i guess one thing that bothers
		      me is folks that refuse to admit the fact of spirits. 
		      i'm trying to not jump to conclusions, but i sense
		      the recent mix ups portend to an end point...i nearly
		      weep at having this confusion over lotta...yet i can
		      only wait to see what will be...que sera, quo vadis...
		      quicksand party i am sinking in the middle of what
		      looks to be models...confident women all of them paired
		      up...i have a memory of jan, my quip in the elevator 
		      about garlic pizza, it keeps away vampires, to which
		      she said, and everyone else...so the setting was like
		      that space but not exactly...i stand then sit next
		      to a dark haired girl and she is very inviting, i 
		      notice then they are all pressing their genitals
		      close together - imagine a sitting position but
		      with their backs to the floor - jelly fish and 
		      exotic aquatic things, seahorses, swim and float
		      to and fro the vulvas the labias the vaginas and
		      in some cases the anus - i have not moved yet it
		      is also as if i'm floating - hovering over all
		      of them - then further invitation to join in
		      the sex aquarium i guess you'd call it to which
		      i said something about lotta and being shy and
		      having to go all at once as if words brought me
		      through descending elevator into waking reality - 
		      i had worked one night at the pink pussy cat
		      parlour down in the village when that was mel's
		      gig and a few years ago i dreams=t of him when
		      i was in 3k - the shower flowing and filled with
		      turtles and squids and the like that were speaking
		      and flapping around as if sending me a message i
		      could not and still don't understand - in the 
		      shower yesterday trying to rid myself of what
		      can only be described as whiplash - that visited
		      while scrolling through social media - i felt
		      something beside me, it was one of the curtains
		      that had slipped out of place...i sensed lotta
		      yet in some sort of well slow motion blinking -
		      she was actually catching up with a friend - later
		      posting photos that had the photographer's reflection
		      in the frame - marlene talked to me about fame,
		      i thought of the hiatt song...i thought of my
		      own songs briefly as the notification came in
		      of their 'release' - obviously, these had been
		      out before and i was truly more concerned with
		      lotta except for of course hoping for their success
		      not that i ever felt them as failures no but more
		      so that warner brothers would meet regret and
		      want to sign up two skinny girls so we could say
		      no, man, we want to be a columbia recording artist,
		      well sony...well so long for now it's the day they
		      opened Tutankhamen's burial site in 1924...a century
		      ago...they asked if i prefer my time travel going
		      back or forth, without heistation i responded thataway.
		      there is no future without the past, the previous 
		      sequence of events...in fact i honestly believe there
		      has mostly been only repetition since world war two. 
		      ps, i ordered communion wafers for mom and have
		      a devilish excitement to meet her reaction. 
		      <br>
		      <br>
		      twelve march
		      <br>
                      i actually have too much within my mind...listing the
		      films i watched and skipped the last week and the
		      book i glanced at before the typing started...
		      so yeah the wafers arrived as did lotta in paris, 
		      i remember it was the self same day i tried all
		      the variations on the jackson plugged in...dear me
		      i can actually tap on this axe like some sort of 
		      piano...so that was a freak out minute in a nice
		      way as was feeling her presence for a few minutes
		      about the same time yet as i put place the six strings
		      away i sensed i was looking back at myself somehow,
		      like the instance with the guitar has somehow filmed
		      and playing in my mind's eye...time then slowed and
		      i surrendered to a strange wait...for ms stichler
		      which only felt ironic having made it a point to 
		      be awake early for her only to wind up lost in 
		      confusion...in feeling myself near to judgement
		      and or blame - although a natural reaction - i
		      started to feel concern for that instinct since i 
		      had no idea what she might be going through...
		      when i went to paris a woman told me i couldn;t 
		      smoke outside charlie degaulle and i joined a 
		      crowd that was all smoking next to a no smoking
		      sign...is the whole thing going backwards, arethey
		      playing our song...what was it you wanted, what was
		      it i wanted...in a not so simple twist of fate i
		      quoted a verse from arthur mcbride as a sort of 
		      farewell sensing that her idea of forever meant
		      only a few months...but here i am on the bordeline
		      of passing down sentence...the fact is i am not 
		      sure what went down and can only say that my feeling
		      was pretty foreign or far away from the sensation of
		      her...in starting to query my own emotions i further
		      deleted instagram and telegram...which i know will
		      sound extreme to some yet didn't and doesn't sound
		      foolish to me exept it underlines that lonesome
		      feeling as if there were less people in the world - 
		      anyway for all i know she might have come to dislike
		      my affection/attention and so i redecorated the 
		      domain sections that had her featured...upon her
		      return the only unusual thing she posted was a 
		      bottle of wine with a fish on the label...i suppose
		      your guess is as good as mine...dreams didn't help,
		      i only recall a handful from the past week; a bone
		      jutted out from atop my right thigh and was nearly
		      reaching the table, someone was in front of me and
		      i was trying to play it cool while wondering what
		      to do then awoke. in another scene, i was in the
		      back seat of a car, a man in the front seat turned
		      around and said something but i haven;t a clue about
		      the words since he looked like someone out of 1960s
		      history book...bizarre...then last night i dreamt 
		      about soraya who i have not had contact with in 
		      long while...in any case it wasn't all sorrow
		      as i went out once and hit up wendys which served
		      me the greasiest breakfast fries i have ever guessed
		      upon with salt - flies, literal flies, were hanging
		      out on the back row dining tables...i was making 
		      my way back from getting a phone book and smokes
		      and trying to get a taxi back, since being hounded
		      by law enforcement in the past, i don't carry a 
		      cell phone with me when i go out - i turned into
		      a lighting and lamp shop and made my pleading speech
		      for their help with as much humor and patience as i
		      could manage, one of the girls walked away and i followed
		      feeling she was on her way to call a cab, maite, maite,
		      was terribly nice. it's an app she explained using the
		      full word - application...she even walked me to the door
		      and waited to find the car she had contacted, i was so 
		      moved i touched her right arm as if in love...later i felt
		      that had been too over the top...although sometimes it is 
		      exactly what a person needs, a wordless thank you in the 
		      form of a caress - i felt that way sitting in a library
		      once upon a time - librarian touched my arm so gently
		      it felt like a an embrace...i'm in no race but i have
		      improved the living space some - oh yeah and the flying
		      v got a redesign which turned out divine although at the
		      time all i could think of was lotta or what had occured
		      that now felt beyond any cure...i even started to mistrust
		      my imagination - well, we will i suppose see what happens -
		      today she did mention something in passing about a friendship
		      breakup yet it is hard to know what she meant, what she means -
		      i only know that i don't want to chance further stabbings in
		      the dark as it were...my imagination is equally too tame
		      and to wild upon certain turns and even shuts down at the 
		      heart's weeping...where was i, ah the guitar decore -
		      looking at the cover, i took a listen to 
		      we have always lived in the castle reading by kalin hollingshead
		      who does a stop and even restate while presenting...a couple
		      of chapters in i decded to turn to the film...the one
		      with taissa and alexandra in it...now i have read the book
		      and seen that movie before but it was clear that once was not
		      enough -  i suppose that is the case with anything worth
		      the while - in yet another failed attempt to see adolescence
		      i turned to the prizefighter and the lady wherein i was
		      awed by the song and dance number - there was no awe in
		      lumina, although i always enjoy seeing eric roberts - 
		      earlier i was getting into 'the awful truth' yet due
		      to technical difficulties i wound up watching a very
		      weird screwball skit named 'that uncertain feeling'
                     which looked to be the origin of more than several 
		      subsequent films and songs - the weird surprise
		      was 'the capture' circa 1950...well if westerns
		      aren;t out of your way...far away in my own new
		      script inky is put placed in charge of shaping up
		      the catholic church, he commences by castrating
		      all the male clergy, some insist on keeping their
		      cut off parts in a preservative container within
		      the lining of their wardrobe but mostly they are
		      thrown out in the unused backyard that is adjacent
		      to the makeshift clinical lab were the cocks meet
		      the knife...as time passes a tree grows there sprouting
		      dicks of all shapes and sizes, some call it obscene while
		      others claim it a miracle...some of the priests even party
		      proclaiming the godly power of their magic markers - 
		      nuns are found fornicating and even tasting the tree...
		      inky is at a loss for what to do until finding a woman
		      with a gold tipped dildo in his spam messages, ordering
		      dozens of the devices he instructs the nuns that have
		      been brought down by temptation, they are categorized
		      as the eves, to secretly massage themselves as they see
		      fit...the pope gets wind of this part of the story and
		      suffers from shortness of breath which requires hospital
		      care, there is talk that inky will be let go even ex-communicated
		      yet he sends in an expert team from the nordic lands to give
		      the pontif a full body rub down while playing songs from
		      the argentina of his youth...the recovery is immediate
		      and meetings are held to iron out the kinks as it were - 
		      the film then replays in reverse until the credit rolls
		      as inky "starts" to work...well there then i wish i had
		      better news but i don't except that the kramer has cleared
		      customs and should be here any day now.
		      <br>
		      <br>
		      13 march<br>
		      <br>
		      any day meant yesterday yet not only that...the kramer arrived
		      with the fender case i had ordered due to the price and it turns
		      out to be a perfect match for the ibanez...yet not only that
		      as then i was informed that the rest of this haul was nearly
		      all set to be sent out...if a month would countdown quickly
		      then i might also have the tele i settled for instead of my
		      desired next guitar along with the flying v case and the rest
		      of it...now when i say settle i do not mean i didn't want it too...
		      two tone knobs had me a bit confused, the whammy bar didn't
		      feel right, and the fret edges pecked away at my index and
		      thumb, but oh how i adore this mahogany body and maple neck
		      axe...it is a strat style like the roadstar, but i have 
		      owned a fender stratocaster and in some aspects this is 
		      actually better, it beats it by the way the neck feels
		      uhm even with the cutting sharpness which obviously could
		      be filed down easily...in weighing it i recalled why never
		      really wanted a gibson so much as they felt so heavy...although
		      i did like my very old les paul junior very much...still even
		      with that - which i then had a nice warm tube amp and chorus
		      pedal - there were was no sweetness in the tone...which this
		      somehow has...maybe i merely learned to play a bit more by
		      now as opposed to way back when...but i wasn't trying to 
		      play as it were i was tuning it up and checking the switches
		      as i sauntered through some bebop scales and chords...how
		      might i explain, it was like a backwards sigh at the surprise
		      of hearing what is that, resonance...vibratoish reverb...a
		      real emotional sound which i believe i have yet to exhale,
		      that sigh went in and was lost in the shock of oh wow even
		      through a shitty ancient high end of the low t-power amp
		      without any effects the kramer rings out a gentle force
		      that could rival any ringing...my only other note is that
		      my die hard cord somehow felt too tight in the jack socket
		      as i struggled to pull it out although it might have been
		      due to the angle of my pull as that didn;t happen the first time.
		      oh yeah the color, in this case the red one or ruby as they
		      call it, is a sort of pastel - neither bright nor loud - as if
		      subdued seemingly more pink than crimson...the real twist in 
		      the story is that if i wanted to i could switch out parts from
		      the roadstar since they are nearly identical yet i like it
		      so much that i even have second thoughts about replacing the
		      pickguard as i had planned...and yes i wouldn't want to ever
		      disturb my ibanez...my apologies for the guitar porn.
		      in any case i hope this note helps anyone on the fence over
		      an inexpensive kramer. the price is a lie, and there is a
		      lifetime guarantee to repair the thing for as long as the
		      purchaser owns the guitar. i need not say more on the subject
		      except i hope and wish to have another kramer down the line.
		      in dreams i felt easy, yet once again i wandered around
		      in some dark city landscape evening while carrying a woman
		      upon my back as one would a child or as a reader might imagine
		      one of my earlier dreams...i had the notion it was emilee yet
		      i also had the idea it was lotta...no eyes in the back of my
		      head...a car had turned over seemingly after too much speed -
		      i neared and a leaned in to see a woman upsidedown, hey
		      she started to say as if everything was entirely normal, how
		      about we go out and get some cocaine...the lyric to west
		      l.a. fadeaway and sue belle driving in palm beach crossed my mind...
		      i got up then thinking to type it up but i knew if i did
		      i might find myself awake too early thus taxing my cigarette
		      stash more than i wanted - i went back to sleep still in the
		      sensation of being content over the new guitar...the day
		      before i had dreamt of another woman put placing a piece
		      of meat into a frying skillet - it seemed to be seasoned
		      only with rosemary or oregano - i rattled out of the scene
		      as the first part of it started browning in the oil -
		      then tonight well this morning even if in los angeles it
		      is still only very late in the evening, i had casual scenes
		      that once again wove in and out of memory's view as if merely
		      sliding by as if to say nothing to see here or everything
		      will be allright somehow...i thought of india maybe more than
		      i wanted and then wroted these words.  i want to party with
		      a pizza but i can't order one for five hours or so...six in
		      the eastern standard time zone...i imagine lotta is having
		      lunch by now...hopefully none of my doubts or weirdness
		      have been an imposition on her...or others. 
		      <br>
		      <br>
		      14 march
		      <br>
		      in a picnic table dream two sisters sit across each other.
		      they have matching haircuts. very short blonde bobs.
		      one of them is next to me. on my left side. 
		      she is speaking about her haircut. it was yesterday.
		      that is about all i hear. a plate of food is passed.
		      the picnicesque table extends past my view, i can only
		      see a dark haired woman sitting on my right side...
		      as the plate is put placed near me a man approaches
		      the sister on the other side. he is giving her a
		      cooked baby carrot. no, a cooked baby corn like
		      the ones mei sauteed in szechuan style restaurant
		      second floor broadway before gambling the place away.
		      i watch her open her mouth and swallow the thing then
		      awake. 
		      the day had not been eventful, i ate some of the pizza
		      thinking of julia mecey, i started to watch the devil's
		      backbone, but i was still too distracted by the new
		      guitar which i eased some with a nail file which did 
		      the job but then i had a bit of fret buzz on the low
		      e string which resolved itself by getting the axe in
		      tuning...i then removed the strings of the martin acoustic
		      with the intent to upend the glued bridge job i had
		      performed years ago when i didn't know i had to clamp it
		      down while letting it dry. my job was too well done and
		      i couldnt find a way to undo it with desire and knife - 
		      put placing the large kramer sticker where the pickguard
		      came off some weeks ago i tried not to worry about
		      being stuck with such high action on the neck, i might
		      have even thanked it for giving my scale ritual extra strength,
		      i have extra strings but put the same ones back - i entertained
		      the flying v with all the pentatonic scales thinking how
		      it is really the one to use for any type of lead guitar work -
		      it was the first day in a long while that i did not play
		      the ibanez...later i couldnt resist another round with the
		      kramer and it was then i noticed that the unplugged sound
		      vibrates nearly equally from the back in a sort of stereo
		      effect wherein i could hear a bit of the tone that i enjoyed
		      so much when it was amplified...in other words another surprise
		      perk to the magic i did not ever expect...i went to sleep
		      early lamenting having to plan to go out for cigarettes
		      given that the shop i order from was yet again out of stock -
		      after what i am calling the picnic dream i dreamt of 
		      an asian woman's picture...she was holding a guitar but
		      the photograph had another side and in that other picture
		      she was in a squat, legs partly spread - her genitals
		      visible below a nearly wicked grin...i got up then and
		      jotted this down.

		      post-script, i keep looking over at my new guitar and 
		      wonder how long this excellent feeling with last...yet
		      the reason for adding to this entry follows, an experience
		      i have not encountered before and found baffling;
		      i was thinking of gene and how the last news of him
		      -before the sad story of his passing -
		      had to do with a pie...apple pie? well, whatever but
		      it was about the time that tampere was released...
		      i adjusted the cover and pulled out the record, 
		      needing to make the level-sent wav into an mp3
		      or flac file...i tried three or four places with 
		      each informing me that the converted file could not
		      be downloaded in lacking a scan of some sort...
		      this being an 'opera' browser - i switched to another
		      browser and got an mp3 version, then it would only
		      upload eighty percent, i converted again and the flac
		      went through however the serial number came out as 
		      already in use, maybe that one is still in some stores?
		      how would i know...frustrated and with a sense of desperation
		      i finally put it through obviously having to wait to hear
		      when it will be re-released...all of it feels to strange
		      to even say like a tongue twister - packed peter pickles
		      piper pecked checked and rechecked - by the way laudanum
		      is still yes still in that limbo wait...my apologies if
		      anyone was expecting it before this or whenever it gets
		      back to its place...for the more curious, tampere is 
		      a city in finland...i locked all that i could lock and
		      put placed an extra padlock on the front gate leaving
		      to search for the cigarettes and gather up the milk and
		      eggs i also had planned to get...that at least was a 
		      success and even grabbed some camphor on the way - 
		      i was told that there was a credit amount at barnes
		      and not so noble and responded that if that was the
		      case i wanted a specific shirley jackson collection - 
		      i felt her or perhaps e. moss while making my exit...
		      in the magical world these things happen, i was not
		      taken aback. i proceeded to play the entire scale
		      ritual on the new kramer...i picked up a film called
		      borderline which put the madonna echo in my head...
		      i don't know how i know so many songs and also don't
		      know so many songs in some sort of inner contradiction -
		      oh well at least now i see how oh babe it ain't no lie
		      when the dead were jamming and jerry as if possessed
		      put placed some antique ballad into the air and bob
		      questioned, i think it was bob, so that that simply
		      came to your mind out of nowhere and he was like yeah -
		      not as impressive as hearing moonlight play in my
		      head upon listening to grace's new song idea...
		      no gatekeeping, i did tell her...had to look up the
		      title which felt weird because i learnt that entire
		      record at the same time i got into open tunings
		      for blood on the track covers...i suppose it's like
		      burroughs' dream machine .. some sort of revolving
		      mechanism that spins itself invisible yet lets out
		      a light every so often...not that i can claim to recall
		      all those chords but seeing i am way past being
		      concise and to the point let me conclude with the
		      title of new screenplay well synopsis..."THE NIFTY
		      END FIRST" 
                      <br>
		      <br>
		      ides of march
		      <br>
		     ( prelude note, when i mention the film replaying
		      in reverse), i mean exactly that except with variations
		      in shots and soundtrack...possibly lighting too. i 
		      explained my notion idea to mother telling her that
		      the nudity and sex would be done in a way that voids
		      exploitation as well as not exceeding the story itself,
		      all the good or great films with naked scenes are like
		      that, one remembers the narrative not the exposure -
		      i have second thoughts in terms of it not having an
		      action sequence yet i don't have much more than some
		      younger priest trying to duck the decree, getting on
		      mopeds and being chased by vatican guards in of course
		      vans through the curving byways of rome...
		      (pretending i didn;t see that note), when i hit the 
		      play button on borderline i couldn't help continually
		      hitting the skip ahead button until finally it came
		      to its end. it looked promising even synchronistic
		      in starting at the end like i was thinking for my
		      spec, but it was a red herring, once the 'action'
		      started it was neither entertaining, informative,
		      or funny...i don't know why they made this like that
		      and wished i had missed it...now the devil's backbone
		      felt like genius even if pulp in contrast...
		      the title on the opening is the deserter i think,
		      maybe i should have deserted that movie before having
		      to write about how much i disliked it...
		      (positively new dream note), i'd gone to sleep late -
		      yet awoke a few hours later to the sound of a feral
		      cat howling, i struggled to decide if i should leave
		      the bed and did so thinking of skirt - the cat inside.
		      the cat outside kept howling as if possessed...i had
		      wanted to quote dylan to anne marie, the cops don't
		      need you and man they expect the same, but it was
		      the first time she ever responded and who knows maybe
		      she was right - maybe it is safe in miami at three 
		      forty seven in the morning - about that self mentioned
		      time eastern standard i tried to go back to sleep but
		      could not...thinking of her and grace, and india, and
		      rachel with her paypal story, and what alexandra is
		      going to do with her pets when she goes to italy and
		      even if ashley was sending me a secret message yes 
		      even if lotta was implying that she'd been here and
		      knew all about me through a sandwich and chips...
		      what i really wanted most of all was to play my new
		      guitar, the kramer even if the jackson was the one
		      i should concentrate on given how it could improve
		      my playing...i got up again restless and smoked a
		      cigarette instead and by that time i was reeling
		      with the knowledge that my love for lotta was a lot
		      more than i could explain...the sensation surrounded 
		      me, i am tempted to say embraced me but more likely
		      seduced me...well re-seduced me, reducing me to lay
		      there as if intent on worship, well re-worship...
		      she was even in my dream, i suppose i was trying to
		      tell her something and she was trying to tell me 
		      something and in the crossfire of words i couldn't
		      hear what she said while standing next to her by some
		      wall sized windows that looked out onto other buildings,
		      a school i saw later - there was a french school across
		      the street in something burroughs wroted - bertolt brecht
		      says you are a flathead, maybe i was trying to explain how
		      or why i turned so crude with mother a couple of times
		      during a previous conversation -or how some phrases are
		      nearly impossible to translate - the western has a great
		      example, if you ask someone if they ate tongues when they
		      go on and on well it sounds strange in english yet in 
		      castellano it makes sense and is even entertaining for 
		      reasons beyond my comprehension...as i turned in the
		      dream possibly still surprised that the whole emilee
		      comp het came to mind in the whirlwind of earlier thoughts,
		      compulsory heterosexuality, i could not tell if it was 
		      because of her or because lotta's middle name is emilie...
		      in the dream there is a dresser containing drawers where
		      i have hidden away some valued possessions - i cross the
		      loft for it must have been a loft to have such windows -
		      yet upon gazing through the contents i find some of the goods
		      have been stolen - suddenly i turn my glance to the entrance
		      and see a horrid looking man punching himself in the head
		      and dropping to the floor as if a self-inflicted knock out -
		      another man, not so horrid in appearance and smartly attired
		      starts a speech on how he made that happen and how he found
		      and forced himself onto my stash - i am trying to figure out
		      who these people are and how it all might relate to me yet
		      in shake head motion i stand entirely uncertain as to how
		      to proceed then in a rightward glance i notice horses,
		      soldiers upon the horses, all of them bright and glowing,
		      there are other soldiers with rifles - there is a command
		      to shoot from behind them and they do so - meanwhile i 
		      start thinking i should get back to the window and without
		      much care for the artillery i make way through- waiting as
		      they press gunpowder into nozzles to continue firing...like
		      being in two worlds - i don't look back, standing at the window
		      alone now i can hear the conversation as the children make
		      their way out and the teacher talks to one little girl about
		      needing to care for her skin as it looked to be too dry -
		      you sure do have dry skin, she said...i had said as much to myself
		      upon feeling my legs in the earlier portion of the late evening.
		      i type this up after gathring my thoughts...i remember being
		      on the upper east side, i had noticed an extra dry spot on the
		      outer side of the top of my left calf before going out, as 
		      i walked a little girl, hmm younger than the one in the dream -
		      say that one was nine or ten while this was one was four or five -
		      scratched the self-same spot pausing a second to do so until the
		      woman holding her hand was pulling instead of being in rhythm -
		      those very early students at the sacred heart school wear a sort
		      of italian restaurant table cloth uniform...it is only later that
		      they get the actual school uniform. here's to the frog leap 
		      sophomore that made a very cute impression as i went by and she
		      was entering the institution with her classmate friend back in 
		      head lice city.
		      (post-script note), the late great american film - writer - director
		      - and actor - saunters in as a general to reinstate the deserter
		      making the devil's backbone a real treat for me...i'm not saying
		      it's worth your while to view, i'm only saying i liked it and
		      the fact that he is in it made it rise a bit above pulp b-movie
		      spahgetti western.

		      16 march
		      <br>
		      imaginary drugs felt like they were kicking it in the early
		      afternoon - i was drowsy and didn't even feel much like playing.
		      for a minute i missed having only a couple of guitars since
		      now i always sense the longing to not neglect this one or that...
		      the six strings have been drinking, not me...deadly tornado in
		      the southern states yet i wasn;t looking at the news much yesterday
		      and caught up on the events a few minutes ago...seems awful...
		      kicking were they like felt drugs...imaginary hmm, the pants are
		      if it us true in the mind then it ain't no lie on some level...
		      level, i can hardly stand to use or see that word no more...
		      well, maybe with the exception of tore down, the blues number
		      that is...i didn't get to skin care, opting instead to indugle
		      my drowsiness...who knows, perhaps or maybe i should have waited
		      a bit more...i wasn't myself at the turning of the tide that
		      trips into sleep...something pulling in opposite directions - 
		      i settled into dream position as a dog was yelp barking loud
		      and intensely for more minutes than i cared to count as if in
		      response to the previous day's cat howl...the german shepard
		      in the movie doesn't make it being overtaken by the 'savages'...
		      i haven't felt a good stretch of sleep in a while, last night
		      was no different...i recall a dream wherein a man - heavy and
		      strange to me - sauntered near to the bookshelf i put placed
		      in the hall...there had been several unusal noises before i 
		      dozed off and certain sounds still make nervous - in this case
		      it was more about jihoon who mentioned falling asleep with 
		      her door open and awaking to someone looking in to see if
		      she was all right...so in my superstition, i entertained panic
		      and that possibly resulted in that scene - the man seemed curious
		      about burroughs and i was at a loss for words mainly trying to 
		      get him away from myself and my books - i had the feeling that
		      it was a cousin but i have so many cousins i couldnt tell...
		      i awoke feeling neither rested nor inspired...i stumbled into
		      the internet to see havana was still in the dark - i thought
		      about how i should not make such a scene about tidying up
		      the house and simply get to it - but i still had no plan or
		      intent in that area - coffee, cigarettes, suddenly enchanted
		      by a jackson west song that names some famous outlaw, i weighed
		      how wonderful it would be to hear marcus king cover that one -
		      in a southern blues rock fashion...he has his own new song too
		      yet for me it slips and slides too much between the eagles
		      desperado and the allman brothers midnight rambler, not musically
		      but merely from the lyric...the lyric is what i pay attention to
		      mainly...obviously not the case when it's instrumental...in other
		      words wishing these people well...someone was asking people to 
		      name artists that had back to back perfect albums...i thought
		      and still think the pretenders II and Learning To Crawl fit
		      that defintion where even 'Get Close' nearly made it three in 
		      a row...it's sunday and i don't know exactly what to do - 
		      it might be that having had only two left over slices of pizza
		      yesterday and a few chessman cookies wer not enough of a diet
		      to balance myself...damn john barrymore memories made me feel
		      full or at least satisfied...'You shall hear nothing, you shall see nothing, 
		      you shall think nothing, you shall be nothing but Svengali, Svengali, Svengali...,
		      <br>
		      <br>
		      17 march<br>
		      <br>
		      chinese take out. william wyler's the big country...i was viewing
		      it for gregory peck but it was thrilling to also find charlton heston -
		      yet weird to have a song lyric ring out while watching it - what
		      happens tomorrow is on your head not mine...in any case it was kind 
		      of like reading a novel as it lingered without hurry from one scene
		      to the next...cinema houses were made for epics like this one - 
		      now haunted by the sunset boulevard line, i am big - it's the 
		      pictures that got small! i played all my electric guitars to 
		      not have jealousy in the ranks...i dreamt naked girls in my
		      bed that i did not see...i suppose i was still rattled by
		      the stray noises that chimed while i was trying to think of 
		      lotta and reach the dream lands...one of them looked so 
		      beautiful she could have been a goddess...i slid atop her
		      stopping for a second to look as i crossed onto what must
		      have been another going to sleep scene in silence - i can 
		      only explain it by stating that i dreamt i was dreaming 
		      easy and awoke with only that in mind...well i also had it
		      in mind to go for a used blackstar id core that was cheap 
		      until i saw the delivery and tax added up to might as well
		      get the boss katana...all this came about upon a missing
		      ag spalding pen that had been shipped from italy...from
		      an aforementioned haul...i was also sexually excited yet
		      i couldn;t concentrate...so i played scales on the ibanez
		      thinking how friendly it felt, how i could even be more 
		      aggessive without worrying over snapping a string - i even
		      looked over the prometheus scale with intent to memorize it
		      even as i planned to cut the scale ritual as follows;
		      all the bebop scales on the kramer, all the pentatonic
		      and voodoo scales on the jackson, and selected others
		      on the ibanez...that is, after i settle all scores with
		      what i have gathered in terms of that over the last two
		      years of dedication to them...the last ones i learned,
		      i find, are not wholly held in the mind...much like the
		      issue i had with enigmatic and arabic until i termed
		      the later one byzantine...but yeah, seeing that film was
		      like oh i'm james mckay getting knocked about by old thunder
		      only to satisfy myself...if i keep the count low, i believe
		      i will feel more freedom for other aspects of the instruments.
		      it's only an idea but i am leaning in that direction...
		      i was leaning into oh wow anne marie followed me but then
		      the notification tuned away from itself...still, for a minute
		      i could not contain my grin...left over chinese then with
		      red onion as i thought about julia mecey's vest - uhm i should
		      have said that theory, in terms of the ritual, came about while
		      fiddling and finding i could actually recall a rhythm and
		      riff i had learned by ear way back when and realized the
		      scales will be there long after even if i leave some for
		      now...the rhythmic chords and riff well they hardly met
		      such continual greetings...so there was the catalyst, that
		      and going over the specs of the flying v - purplewood it
		      said...i said purplewood? the shirley jackson book cover
		      sticker is none other than purple...there was a groove 
		      in the air, not notes but a sensation that i was on the 
		      right track...hopefully it will work out...after ordering
		      the amp i went into india's kite, a minute later she was 
		      asking for no less than amp...yes i know, yet as a writer
		      i can't help but note it since it sort of proves the 
		      groove had carried itself over from sunday into present
		      time monday...lotta said she was editing a video and
		      i felt an expectation in that knowledge which made the
		      day feel a fine sense of hope...i need to plan a snack
		      and put away the guitars which are now overwhelming the
		      sofa...
		   ps, i should have mentioned my panic at the sounds were
		      made to pull more as i pushed through the knowledge
		      that the nozzle of a spray upon the bookshelf in
		      question - there awaiting to be put away along with
		      other items - was found on the floor...yes, skirt
		      might have jumped up on there yet he hasn't been
		      prone to naps or sleep upon that space lately...
		      earlier i had a double take glance moment as if
		      an aura was still hovering in front of that wood.
		      ps ii, lotta's video featured hallon soda - the 
		      word translates as raspberry...there are also
		      nicotine pouches named like that...it was her
		      third english video and she was not feeling well -
		      i wished for her recovery and proceeded to visit
		      my guitars again, the new ones...
		      ps iii, i had heard the song 'get together', very
		      hippie sixties thing alike 'love the one you're 
		      with'...i would have said it was csn&y...but it's
		      the youngbloods...the obituary named jesse colin
		      young...i suppose it's fair to say a one hit 
		      wonder but i am not certain that was a hit song -
		      real name perry miller...
		      ps, iv, playing along with 'alabama getaway' which
		      i thought was in A, through a minor scale in E -
		      stil sort of worked yet i had the weirdest pressure
		      like someone trying to look through one of my eyes...
		      later in reflection it did not feel like it usually
		      had it the past - hmm yes the fan at full speed was
		      louder than the cell phone volume...the axe was also
		      not plugged in...a long strange trip indeed...still,
		      an unusal chord progession arrived while looking up
		      the variations of E6add9...i'm not implying that
		      chord is from that tune. 
		      ps, v, on a whim i made the email for this domain
		      dream@wordstar.nexus - given the possibity of spam
		      i am not going to glue the hmu yet if you have 
		      a dream to share please send it along...
		      <br>
		      <br>
		      18 march <br>
		      <br>
		      i myself had no specific dreams, yet i slept all right
		      you could say or easy...easing into the day feeling 
		      lighter somehow...in searching through guitars and
		      lately guitar magazines...i felt pretty weird over
		      a mentioned 'deal' - going to the link, it was
		      for something called fender play, which i guess is
		      why they have put placed all these 'online lessons'
		      on so many of their products, it seems one would
		      sign up for that and gain a guitar along with whatever
		      it is the fp is about...what i found strange is that
		      the guitar is not any fender, not even a squire...no,
		      it is a 'nashville works' thing in the stratocaster shape.
		      it feels contrary to logic...i took out the trash, 
		      maybe that is what they are doing...i chopped up
		      a potato and scrambled eggs, excited that lotta was
		      trying on dresses she had no time to wear, yet not
		      finding much to like in seeing the rest of kite...
		      the flaw in the film is that the protagonist is not
		      a superhero so all the 'heroics' are balanced on 
		      luck and the action turns favoring the her-o...
		      i was of course viewing for india and for the fact
		      that the trailer looked promising, but i have no
		      words of praise...i thought about cutting my nails
		      and i was craving the sequel to horizon ; an american
		      saga chapter - 1...
		      well, at least i found how or why the notes i tried
		      with that song matched even if outside the key...
		      i returned to it, the kramer now felt new again as 
		      if i was only just meeting its maple neck after
		      floating through all the pentatonic scales wherein
		      i kept wanting to continue with others against my
		      possible plan to cut back on them...i could hear
		      the fit match in A yet there was still something 
		      with the E notes that made me feel good in an outlaw
		      sort of a way...possibly it's trying new methods
		      that makes me feel as if i am starting to learn
		      the six string instead of expanding on what i 
		      already know...yes overthinking it is not fun
		      yet i believe a certain amount of introspection
		      is not bad...not bad at all, canto lxxxi comes
		      to mind, “Master thyself, then others shall thee beare”...
		      <br>
		      <br>
		      19 march<br>
		      <br>
		      it was way past my bed time, a bad time, as bad as me...
		      a glitch in the diet - or the bed was suddenly hungry...
		      who knows, not i, eyed dreams blinded by the light...
		      the unbearable lightness of being...hair dressers,
		      chrissie hynde, clean up jobs, donka shoen i'm 
		      listing to now, i'll stand by you...in the dream
		      i seem to be in the second balcony, so dark it could
		      have been the forest - lightless - the plant maybe
		      the tree came extremely near, like an embrace - 
		      spirits in the night - spirits in the material 
		      whirl - i went to sleep waiting and i awoke with 
		      only that in mind still waiting...i mean for the 
		      right moment, that minute where everything makes
		      sense...the cents of scents...(they call me the 
		      breeze ain't no change in the weather ain't no
		      changes in me )- hounding news honduras made me
		      worry over the acoustic - fake news hospital drones
		      from the anti-putin press - laudanum finally released -
		      lotta didn't give up on soft drinks...i put placed
		      a pepsi in the fridge waiting for a supermarket
		      delivery that had long been left on the stairs -
		      staring at the phone once twice to be told - sold
		      out my lunch at least the india eisley film felt
		      easier - at least to the secret agent in me - 
		      i'm not sure what the title is, she plays tilly...
		      i spent the rest hours playing guitar - real love
		      was an idea yet i went with all of me in gminor
		      not to play or sing it but to vamp on it...still
		      the pull to piece together all the notes of the
		      scales pushed me into them as i thought oh yeas i
		      should also continue with this one or that in the
		      ritual...i'm all lost in the supermarket i can no
		      longer shop happily - i lifted two windows to let in
		      some of the breeze i felt breathing but several men
		      surrounded a so called tundra car parking it directcly
		      below the opening making for suspicion - i added a
		      pink guitar to my wishing list - listen to the slide
		      rattle on the returned whammy bar upon the kramer -
		      as some lower back discomfort eased some spider or
		      mosquito bit me near where jihoon's heart shaped
		      italian tattoo lives - six dead forty missing - 
		      i doubt they are even using coffins at this point
		      down in lampedusa...desolate penne around abruzza
		      details real estate deals...i could buy seventy
		      houses at that price...presently i'd rather buy
		      guitars...i can't understand how i was content
		      before this axe frenzy...i made the right choice
		      as all of me gave me a full three chord banger
		      i would not have found otherwise...elsewhere
		      mother employed the word hippopatamus and i 
		      was truly like what the ever living hell is
		      this wednesday...hungry hungry hippo - girl
		      from volgograd at asian zoo - alexandra said
		      she was pure evil as a brunette - i am the man
		      thomas, look at fogerty tappin' up on that
		      ibanez - now then it's hard to hear this wayne
		      without wanting to sing a long, goes a way into
		      explaining ferris beuller..." Oh, he's very popular 
		      Ed. The sportos, the motorheads, geeks, sluts, bloods,
		      wastoids, dweebies, dickheads - they all adore him. 
		      They think he's a righteous dude."...

		      correction, tillie not tilly...in any case- not bad 
		      but not good...my feeling is that the director or
		      producer put placed the burden of carrying the
		      film on her...it was hard to believe in some of
		      the other characters and well it was what it was
		      - a cut above mediocre b-movie...partly like the
		      writing, partly like high rollers, like hey it's
		      travolta so we can get away with bad writing - 
		      bad dreams no or perhaps, i can't tell - 
		      spirit of kafka i was surely studying a cord,
		      much like the one in my kitchen which doubles
		      for toaster oven and ready made clothes washer - 
		      vengeful cockroaches who knows - i got up feeling
		      i could have slept a few more hours with ease - 
		      can't exactly get used to wearing my new robe -
		      i made it a point to clean up and did so but i'm
		      still making myself wait to bathe or shower - maybe
		      i wanted to pen these words...i felt all right about
		      the decorations - i felt better about finally
		      finding a viewable copy of 'adolescence' - yesterday
		      - it reminded me a bit of rush, not the band, that
		      undercover drug drama that was pretty good...this
		      was possibly the one i've liked most next to the
		      look away scenes...still, the writing fails a 
		      couple of times and makes you think nobody speaks
		      like that, nobody would say that - well, maybe 
		      i was still feeling critical as it came only a
		      few hours after the other one ended...she was
		      excellent and it's a shame that the rest of it 
		      wasn't up to her performance...i remember thinking
		      to look up the list and see if i had included it
		      as it was partly or ironically about a writer - 
		      i also wanted to put place the artwork that
		      has been waiting now weeks...hmm the house was
		      too much a mess to not tidy it up - fighting 
		      my own inclination to let it be and later 
		      feeling giddy over another track's re-release,
		      i had some hard boiled eggs and added red onion
		      slices sprinkled with olive oil and lime to the
		      ordered mael, uhm meal...so a bit too drowsy
		      to hold my guitar yet still thinking about it
		      with desire which led to recheck the gibson 
		      app which i had previously installed without
		      it working - yesterday it was updated the 
		      store said and indeed that did the trick so
		      i also gave it a place on my other cell phone -
		      i listened to a lot of music and then here i
		      was hearing other tunes while typing...most likely
		      why i missed mentioning that in that she was alice -
		      "From the moment I fell down that rabbit hole I've been
		      told where I must go and who I must be. I've been shrunk,
		      stretched, scratched, and stuffed into a teapot. 
		      I've been accused of being Alice and of not being Alice
		      but this is my dream. I'll decide where it goes from here..."
		      i tell mother about lucid dreaming and astral projection
		      decoding meditation from prayer and knowing full well
		      my own impatience in the first area and lack of interest
		      in the second...there ain't no round trip guarantee if
		      you leave your body...i gave jackson west my thoughts
		      on some lyric partly worried that she might not see
		      the admiration i intended. the part of me from irish simply
		      cannot shut up, i imagine.

		      23 march<br>
		      <br>
		      i could not say what this saturday was about yet hopefully
		      it's over - maybe it was karla's birthday or perhaps that
		      is today...why does one remember certain dates and not others,
		      a minute ago, through the whirlwind of thought which struggled
		      in vain to find out what i had been dreaming about the last
		      couple of days, i thought of what burroughs had wroted, in 
		      this case a question; how long does it take a man to know
		      that he cannot want what he wants? it was on the heels of
		      saying to myself; it's not who you love that counts but
		      rather who loves you. i was loving the idea of odessa, 
		      some musical photo play, until it started stealing from
		      the joey king film princess and put placed everything into
		      a much too simplistic view, that is black and white where
		      only the protagonist's hero journey was given value...so
		      i found myself skipping through the thing after the under
		      the boardwalk allusion, until the dystopian torture reel
		      ended...given my disposition i didn't want to deliver
		      myself in that state of mind into i am the night, maybe
		      it was we are the night...a tnt series with india...
		      i hope to get to that soon...chris pine is in it to boot -
		      ninety nine red balloons go by, everyone's a captain kirk -
		      there's a woman on a ladder in my star trek dream - it's
		      a hallway, hopefully not the hallway of always, a narrow
		      space, another woman standing behind a man holding a
		      paint brush, the tyoe one imagines using for watercolors,
		      he starts brushing at her jeans' buttocks and i'm very
		      upset, and i'm trying to stop him but it's all a frenzy 
		      and i wake up feeling bewildered...i had at least finally
		      bathed or showered although somehow upon deciding to shave
		      i found myself making the exact move that led to a cut -
		      this time on the other side of the neck...hmm not exact,
		      the first was a jagged motion, this was like the blade 
		      caught some angle...there are mysteries beyond the mind -
		      in new screenplay notes, imagination tells me, there
		      is a cup with a living tongue at the bottom that attempts
		      to lick the lips of the drinker when it is used...it must
		      be an evil sect casting itself as the antagonist of inky
		      in the vatican reel...we drink blood from this cup and
		      we don't like catholics...thank you ladies and gentlemen,
		      the plot twist wroted itself...maybe the film is better
		      than i expected...kenny was speaking to john...i heard it
		      once then watched, i was in the middle of disagreeing with
		      mister five on the motley crew point - no, no, not in the
		      same category as who he mentioned...in fact basic pop for
		      me, i wouldn't call it classic rock or even metal...however,
		      having more than a fair amount of respect for the man, i
		      thought i should think about it more knowing full well that
		      i prolly won't - what hit me was hearing kenny say you don't
		      see anybody when you're happening...when i settled in to 
		      my ritual and new concepts on the guitar now plural guitars
		      i didn't feel any improvement although i knew it was there -
		      i wanted to paly play chrods, 'heard it in a love song'
		      worked well...i picked up that sliding into a chord from
		      pink floyd, but i seem to have given it an expanded definition.
		      it was after insect bites and insect in coffee cup as the aforementioned
		      mosquito hung around the room like madness itself...attacking my
		      ankles and making me feel desperate...a johnny winter, a skeeter,
		      my libido...smells like lotta is too much in the sun...so i worried
		      over her forehead but the pain in my neck weighed me down out of
		      nowhere and i knew it would be gone once i gave in to the idea
		      of going to sleep...sure enough what sleep, i get up again amazed
		      at how this sort of thing happens, like a folly, like a farce,
		      like a foolish blindness...it's a good thing i was gifted with
		      patience along with whatever talent remains. in my dreams there
		      are no dreams...yet i see myself, the way i think i look, except
		      i can't call this a dream. i heard the words julio is the trip
		      or maybe julio it's the trip...in another language i heard the
		      words there is nobody here...i had thought how annoying it must
		      have been to be in a band with freddie mercury, and i wake
		      up with queen song hounding me...bahumbug it was only a thought -
		      bro, why you mad...mister farenheit, i relate him now to inka -
		      i read somewhere she was out with livin la vida loca tatum, 
		      the strings on my martin are rusty - i refuse to switch out
		      any strings even the ones that came with the new guitars...
		      jemima was in alone in paris flirting with champange...it does
		      not feel as if it is sunday...somehow in my inner clock it is
		      still friday...i don't like whatever drug this might be, the 
		      last thing i really remember was amanda saying jennifer's 
		      body was perfect and feeling as if my thoughts were yelling
		      themselves in the fashion of street fruit vendors...you 
		      can play the travelin wilbury's inside out here, but if you
		      need to dance then diana ross' upside down might do the trick -
		      sure it;s a stretch step down from love child but them were
		      disco days...this ain't no talking haeds, hades, hays hell
		      i wonder how it would be if they hadn't forced me to shave in
		      high school...as if i didn't have enought two ponder, finding
		      a label finds me yet i cannot make out the reason...ie, 
		      emilee video...possibly lotta emilie video day...i think it's
		      four days in my life, is tangled up in blue the russian novel
		      version of the beatles' paperback 'in my life'...i hope and
		      pray your day is nowhere near the convoluted confusion i have
		      come across this friday weekend without saturday...how do i 
		      conclude, obviously with the question, what fucking strings
		      was zakk using that cut him in concert without snapping or
		      popping out, utterly wild...no i didn't know that story until
		      i did. 
		      <br>
		      <br>
		      24 march<br>
		      <br>
		      once in a weird while now i cannot help but plug in the axe
		      to play along with some song as i notice that in keeping
		      to my extended scale ritual all these weeks and not plugging
		      in well it made me too aggressive in trying to "make" a sound
		      when i would play along to recorded video via my android -
		      with the amp now or maybe with these guitars, i find it obvious
		      that i need to lighten my touch, especially with the plectrum -
		      so very much like sweep picking it is sort of backwards...
		      regardless, i felt very good playing, like no doubt could 
		      enter the non-thinking, reactive approach i took, well there
		      is the 'thinking' of let me try this or that before-hand...
		      but it's a split second proverbial light bulb that is more
		      like counting than consideration...all this to say i think
		      i made the right choice in cutting down the scales to get
		      friendly again with the chords...i was lamenting not being
		      able to find i am the night after seeing the first episode -
		      the woman playing the mom was wickedly good - proving how
		      one performance might elevate another...leter, i did find
		      the rest of it although i had to suffer through 'buffering'
		      and was mostly not disappointed, it was then i learned too
		      that it was based on a true story - the police and ethnic
		      angle got to be a bit too much for me - i had this very
		      strong idea about something lotta had bought...then also
		      trying to recall who brian james was...yes right in the
		      middle of the fourth or fifth episode...i think i even
		      felt i needed to apologize, surely one cannot binge while
		      distracted but then i settled myself by holding my guitar
		      and going through some excercise for a minute or two,
		      meanwhile the hawaii scenes were the highlight for me, 
		      like there was no hurry or any acting at all, it really
		      flowed nicely...the subsequent riots and denouement i 
		      did not like yet i would still say it was worth the view -
		      insane tale...i could understand why it is not on google
		      play or even its mothership tnt which still features the
		      alienist for some reason...anyway, it was evening at
		      that point, i had finally made the steak that'd been 
		      frozen in the freezer for more days than i care to admit-
		      but that was well before the binge, it was when i saw
		      lotta's paris video...after the last couple of videos
		      wherein she seemed intent on going in an unexpected
		      direction or even anxious, it was lovely to see her 
		      obviously happy...i only wished she would have wiped
		      her lenses before shhoting the finale...i thought of
		      emilee and margaret and ashley as i poured myself into
		      bed for sleep...i don't trust my feelings about emilee
		      due to my somewhat gullible nature, i think maggie was
		      merely trying to figure out seeing her with a lap dog -
		      and last but not least i'm pretty sure i was still 
		      surprised that ashley had posed in a bunch of bikinis
		      leaving out the one i said was not a bikini but a disco -
		      i fell asleep foolishly trying to hold on to the image
		      of lotta, i dreamt of some sort of tour dance, i think
		      it might have been on a roof top, guitars hidden in 
		      hard cases were being stacked like they were getting
		      ready to go somewhere...i'd gone up there in an elevator -
		      a high rise i'd never been too - i felt the motley 
		      crew explanation turning, yes at least they were a success
		      where many other countless bands had failed - then a sun
		      burnt billy idol doll was singing mony mony and i picked
		      it up to put place it with the guitar cases...i awoke then
		      it had only been a couple of hours since i went to sleep -
		      i thought about his videos with the cops and how it made
		      me feel like i had a friend in a desperate time, in a 
		      senseless desperation...but i didn't know what to make of
		      it...i had dug my nails deep into my back where the bite
		      itched, or some succubus left her orgasm mark while i 
		      slept the night before this...i could feel it tingle
		      along with the razor cut neck, same side i see now - 
		      but then i didn't see, i surrendered to not knowing
		      and went back to bed, to sleep - i felt alone and 
		      was possibly thinking of mother, i dreamt walking
		      manhattan, the streets not so crowded, a shop had
		      a sort of tote bag in the window with an embroidered
		      vinayaki - the elephant headed goddess which has no
		      exact meaning but arguably cute - language is a virus
		      from outer space...i recall now part of my conversation,
		      when i think of indians i sometimes think of pocahontas
		      which makes me think of grand-mother and then you in that
		      dressed up teen age picture...i suspect wiretappers - 
		      going hindu rather than powhatan...in any case, within
		      the dream i walk into the shop with the intention of
		      getting her the carry bag...somehow i pick up a bottle
		      of pepsi - but suddenly donald, trump not southerland,
		      is fighting me for it in an absurd dance and we are 
		      spinning around without resolution i awake and notice
		      the overhead fan noise, how much sound does it take, not
		      much, it has a rattle click, i imagine him in stutter
		      loop saying the word if, if , if , if, if, if, but obviously
		      it's the loose screw of the contraption...bringing us full
		      circle to the point of not needing to be aggressive while
		      playing since an amplifier often needs only the lightest
		      touch to translate the strum or pluck...sorry if anyone
		      expected politics, i told you i was not political, i only
		      point at it in protest which i nearly did again as the 
		      press posted the shameful notion of k harris for the
		      next election hmm one wonders if m markel will be the 
		      running  mate...it could all be another "nflx"
		      ($920.60) docu-series with t swift songs...whatever,
		      in terms of politics when is someone going to explain
		      all the financial aid that filled up kiev since the
		      folks fled in exodus a thousand days ago...they do
		      claim over five million refugees up and went...somewhere...
		      if only them funds would have gone to education!
		      <br>
		      <br>
		      25 march<br>
		      <br>
		       i suppose they are saying fuck the children, besides
		      we have enough detention centers and jails for the
		      so called minority population...and so the get your
		      gay marriage regime that the nicknamed boss sucks
		      up to allows his protoge to arrive at the john wilkes
		      booth innuendo as if to remind trumpet that there are
		      democratic notes still in the score...they in turn,
		      it seems to me, leak a signal...with help from the
		      once upon a time relevant atlantic now a remnant of
		      itself looking to attract attention on social media -
		      at least we still have harper's and the index...
		      i myself have yet to come across any displaced ukrainian
		      while rambling through the city landscape...one can only
		      hope the current administration can handle the insurrection
		      of planted stories the new york post ironically seems
		      pleased to report as if it made sense or was worth while,
		      at least the consolation prize of having shakespeare
		      mentioned was something..."i hold my peace? no;
		      i will speak as liberal as the north..."
		      some one said it was the guitar that waas bleeding not
		      zakk wylde, i looked at the video, brazil - sao paolo -
		      indeed the strings were all intact...i researched a 
		      bit more; dunlop...possibly the string lab artist 
		      series...it is said he uses (gauge) 10 - 60...in 
		      contrast i like 9 - 46...but i have no mind to think
		      at present, the music pointed to sydney and deleted
		      kisses - like mirroring the ending of the play, hopefully
		      nobody dies but we all know that is wishful thinking - 
		      like taxes in the certainty...fires in korea, they said.
		      my underarm moist with sweat, but i am not in motion -
		      emotional thinking gene vincent urging eddie cochran to
		      visit london where he was then lonesome and in turn urged
		      sharon sheeley to join him...ending 16 april 1960 taxi
		      ride...weird...i had planned to start my day playing
		      guitar yet got caught up in that story and decided to 
		      care for the plants...balcony...no sign of the shoulder
		      pain i carried around the day before as if i had been
		      holding one of those heavy gibson les pauls i never 
		      much liked because of the weight - in fact i felt
		      all right, having awoken thinking i was in the middle
		      of packing something or other in a sort of slinky 
		      shape, uhm accordion shape, no clue what it was about
		      then thinking of lotta...it would have been near noon
		      on her side of the world. i'm not sure i feel rested,
		      although possibly i am from all the previous leisure - 
		      i did order a pizza yesterday and so that is the other
		      part of my plan for today along with il gattopardo 
		      which i wanted to see for deva cassel as she kept
		      showing up in my tiktok for you page...i can't see
		      monica or vincent in her yet it is exciting to know
		      that in a sense she continues their magic, still
		      i am only at the first episode and a few minutes
		      into the second...i don't like it up to now maybe
		      because she is not there yet and maybe because they
		      put placed too much to carry on the prince...the
		      principal character...it's especially annoying if
		      the patriarchy isn't exactly your cup of tea - for me,
		      it's like looking at a composite version of certain 
		      men i have known...i can't explain this except to
		      say if you understand the song 'happy' you might get
		      what i am getting at; "Always took candy from strangers,
                     didn't wanna get me no trade. Never want to be like papa
		      working for the boss ev'ry night and day..."
		      <br>
		      <br>
		      26 march<br>
		      <br>
		      at one point, the leopard, it felt like a soap opera...
		      and having seen the actress playing her character, i
		      left it - thinking the hype was only that...thinking
		      i still didn't like it - how could it work? italians speaking
		      in english - sure sure some nice settings and costumes and
		      she is attractive and the nepo baby aspect never feels present
		      even if the hurried recap of her character's life looked as if
		      a set up hinting at that angle...whatever, maybe it was the
		      incorrect time or setting for me...subsequently i stayed up
		      much later than i wanted or expected...i had, without intent
		      to record or mix any songs, decided to get acid pro eleven -
		      the earlier version was the daw i liked most and hoped this
		      would still have some of the features i enjoyed - so nervously
		      smoking a pack a cigarettes as i tried to fix the scan for
		      vst having put placed an entire windows folder for it to review,
		      so twice unistalled to get that out of the way...not a good 
		      start to it and the folks talking about it mostly don't like it,
		      but how can i fight my own nostalgia...getting to sleep finally
		      i found how nice it is to wrap oneself up in a robe when awaking
		      too early and going for a pee - lotta had been on my mind but
		      not in my dreams - where i seemed to be in the city - night - 
		      i was with a woman that was being chased, well hounded, we 
		      ran, i saw a man direct two dogs towards her direction with 
		      an order to stop her...fucking ai dogs, they did exactly that
		      as if robots - looking at them i wondered over animal skull 
		      implants or maybe three d printed canines...we escaped again
		      but they followed and i awoke more curious than frightened - 
		      i dressed then entirely unsure about what time it might be...
		      it was still sort of early but i stayed up with a desire to
		      clean up a bit more, the house that is...well, i should clean
		      myself up too after the bizarre underarm sweating that so 
		      confused me yesterday...yesterday, what was goodly...oh
		      yeah playing along to some stones songs with the ibanez
		      i could hardly believe the ease and to some extent the
		      speed like the guitar missed being played and was showing
		      off - it made me think that the mind is much faster than 
		      anyone can imagine...like those stories of superhuman strength
		      in certain moments of crisis...i'm not saying it was good only
		      that it felt good and i did not expect a mere thought to be 
		      translated or transposed into my hands' rhythm...kind of a 
		      euphoric feeling, yet strange as i usually don't get that
		      intense in sitting around strumming...still nice, i thought
		      and think yet if it is so casual or without intention then how does one
		      make it happen intentionally...most likely it is all about emotion...
		      a feeling...i also felt goodly seeing one of my comments liked
		      although i worried over the spelling of lucia popp, damned f scott
		      fitzgerald, and then liked even more...letterman called his company
		      worldwide pants...it was about trousers, i suppose the worldwide
		      slacks people agreed..."so you look around the tiny room
		      and wonder where the hell you are while the k.k.k. convention are
		      all stranded at the bar - they wear hoods and carry shotguns
		      in the main streets of Montgomery but they're helpless here as
		      babies 'cause they're only here on holiday" 
		      <br>
		      <br>
		      27 march<br>
		      <br>
		      out of the frying pan and into the fire...yet i love
		      it - in some ego self-righeous selfish way - when i
		      am right...i settled on watching pearl, for no specific
		      reason other than to confirm my instinct...finding i
		      was even more spot on that i could have imagined, i 
		      sat there skipping through it with vindicated pleasure-
		      all the bullshit about it being a good horror film
		      melting away, all the hoopla disappearing...how bad
		      is it? awful. it's only good if you happen to have
		      a prisoner you'd want to torture...i had many chances
		      to see that one but never took them...yesterday i 
		      let the curious part take a peek and so it goes...
		      i made soup and felt iggy pop got a kick out of it
		      somehow...i thought to myself, he's the closest thing
		      we have to dinosaurs...bloody bathroom story memory
		      prolly led me to clean my jacuzzi enviorns...i did
		      the room too with some decorative changes...after
		      my own experiences and california i suppose i am a
		      bit more senstive to news items related to fires,
		      wildfires...although i wasn't worried over the korean
		      one, i am now as i hear they are still burning...
		      my dreams were like the fast flicker of flames, so
		      swift, so slide-show presentation fast, so quick i
		      need to recall them in a fake slow motion - of course
		      that would only be the parts i remember - i woke up
		      thinking it had been like a surreal tv infomercial -
		      someone seemed intent on explaining something like
		      i was stupid, or as they they say now like i'm five,
		      i am not smart in many areas, but i don't think i 
		      am dumb enough to need visual cue cards as the narrative
		      is being negotiated...i am tempted to say it was a 
		      muslim man talking - but would you think sadam hussein 
		      or osama bin laden - my guess was hindu, but that would
		      be racist since pakistan exists and then again egypt
		      which is sunny in a manner of speaking - well let us
		      say i dunno - some dude from a place like that, maybe
		      some dude with a heavy tan putting on an accent for
		      mockery...it's like a dorm outside and i am standing 
		      there watch-waiting as the images swirl and he's yapping
		      away - like he's speaking about me and what i like to 
		      me as if i didn't know - oh yes there's music, he says,
		      the eye lens zooming in on the palm of his hand now 
		      suddenly burdened with different types of creams as if
		      a woman testing shades of blush or lipstick on her forearm
		      at some cosmetics counter - but dig it - the scene is like
		      a split second in real time - maybe i am not even supposed
		      to be hearing it, much less seeing it - that goes on for 
		      a minute with several other 'examples' then he starts 
		      telling about his shoes and some metal or magnet in them
		      that gives a spring to the step as he put it if you were
		      to try to run up the side of a building...they are boots
		      and my eye pans back as i see him start to run up the side
		      of the wall as i wake up feeling no wiser or even interested
		      in who why how where or when well i knew when in terms of
		      my timeline but you get the drift...i was determined to 
		      get up still feeling good about the previous day's ending
		      wherein my love for cinema was vindicated by flight risk -
		      i had no idea or expectation except i saw mel gibson directed
		      it and that was enough for me - and indeed i liked it so much
		      i will shut up about it so as not to sway its vibe for anyone
		      else - nothing else of note to mention, except yesterday
		      i did feel a sense of wanderlust, of wanting to go here or
		      there...i suppose it was missing the jackson west concert,
		      although los angeles ain't exactly my cup of tea.
		      <br>
		      <br>
		      28 march<br>
		      <br>
		      it was positively a nicole kidman party in my play hours -
		      you remember nicole...to die for...dogville days of thunder
		      the others...if i had to choose-pick one it would be
		      margot at the wedding although yes eyes wide shut is the
		      masterpiece...now i did have some hesitation at holland
		      since the automated management film was - well it was like los angeles -
		      and although it proved itself a higher quality, i was not
		      interested in the mystery...like it was trying to be quirky
		      but needed to be directed by david lynch, as it was it felt
		      well like a tv show - now i only thought this after deciding
		      to watch expats...indeed a tv show but secretly cinematic -
		      even the cast looked as if they were all in...a commitment i
		      didnt sense with holland...but then again i was not having 
		      my best day nor living my best life in that time - no i was
		      in fact looking to escape the day and so naturally the movies -
		      so yeah the tv show felt more like the movie than the film 
		      itself...after giving up my impromptu hunger strike, i made
		      what is now my usual diet...a turkey sandwich drenched in 
		      olive oil and kosher salt...lettuce and lays potato chips...
		      this time both pepsi and sprite...i ate thinking man that
		      woman has been working overtime maybe even sundays but then
		      adjusted my thought since her daughter is named like the last
		      day of the week...later in the evening all this led to me
		      playing along with fifty ways to lose your lover and baby did
		      a bad bad thing...followed by the scale ritual and a few minutes
		      with other styles i am trying to get fluent at...in...in, at...
		      tina, ain't it ai...anti..nati...words words words...i went to 
		      sleep not feeling much wisdom or even like myself - maybe i was
		      still concerned over the uneven look of both my middle toes -
		      i had trimmed my nails thinking of the jewess like i always do
		      now when it comes to manicures...each had skin growth on the 
		      lower ending...i suppose i need to investigate the subject -
		      i tossed and turned in bed but was well asleep before long - 
		      the only other thing i did during my semi-desperate day
		      was request an update for acid pro so that the vst scan 
		      works like most others naturally do - in my dream, i 
		      stumbled upon some sort of strange altar - all sorts of 
		      exotic objects - like a cabinet one uses for china - yet
		      one of the center shelves was more spacious - it had a 
		      head, some decapitated thing sitting there, every time i
		      looked at it, it would transform...another face - and
		      another face until what looked like worms crawled over
		      the pink skin in their white slow wiggle...the cabinet
		      was possibly the most important part of aunt's lost house,
		      i told my sister, that is how the quack killed eva, when
		      she was taking mom's blood pressure, of course a knee jerk
		      verbal reaction, but i suspect it led to the dream...i mean
		      why else would i dream of a cabinet...i'd prolly be adored
		      in dublin...but wait, let me ask you, if the atlantic would
		      have simply shut up about it there would be no story, no?
		      point is when you start contemplating what should or not
		      be said well it's nothing in terms of the big picture - 
		      pig bicture, swine city i falt sad for using murder on the
		      floor everytime the street vendors roared and have switched
		      to dushane's chicken mcnuggets genius ultimate form for now -
		      or why i love america...purple mountain majesty...the news
		      poured out quake...it said thailand, but search engines all
		      said myanmar...they mean burma and the burmese declared a 
		      state of emergency, reportedly. i must have been dreaming
		      when it happened - yes again at the airport yes again partly
		      frantic over the departure time...although this time my
		      luggage looked to be all settled - i thought i was going to
		      belfast but the sign overhead said scotland...and when i 
		      went to get my passport stamped i instead pulled out a 
		      dozen or so beer bottles, half of them pilsner type blonde
		      ales and half of them full bodied brunettes...the lady
		      there at the counter said something that made me think
		      why not continue my sober streak, it was like she was
		      telling me they have beer in edinburgh...i edited the 
		      bottles back into position as if to say then keep these here-
		      i have not been thinking about drinking but maybe since
		      the shop once again claimed to be out of my usual cigarettes
		      i might have been feeling like something was missing...
		      indeed these harsher smokes would work better with beer.
		      i got up early, as i made my dream way onto the runway,
		      i thought about my aunt and how i miss her jovial nature,
		      and mother and how i miss her character...it made me
		      feel spiritually closer to india and especially nicole
		      as i knew their loss...some of the joviality and characteristics
		      are still present yet it would be foolish to expect any further
		      logic from either thus multiplying the grief even before
		      the grieving starts as if one were taking a class in mourning
		      where the homework never gets done in denying or defying
		      the fact...i cannot find myself doing otherwise. 
		      <br>
		      <br>
		      29 march<br>
		      <br>
		      well there then expats was no let down, there are scenes
		      which exceed wisdom and furthermore it proves how a woman director
		      might give knowledge a twist that would be difficult for
		      men or artificial intelligence to provide...all this to
		      say i was utterly impressed...
		      the day went by without me doing much else except guitar work -
		      well there was some social media scrolling...and a couple
		      of attempts at strategy chess...i failed to get to sleep 
		      early and was still awake at six in the morning stockholm
		      time - i was thinking of lotta and it seemed to me as if
		      it had been a long while since i felt that type of thought - 
		      a type of nearness...like a dream or trance state - yet in
		      my actual dream i don't think it was her...it seemed to 
		      me another woman in a setting i had not imagined - the
		      room therein nothing that would be in design magazines - 
		      sort of like that dude that wrote the wedding march - 
		      his room could only boast a piano well there was a bed too -
		      but that sort of thing without musical instruments - maybe
		      spartan would be the word - two men are there with the 
		      woman and it feels like i am trying to get her away from
		      them, from that place - one of them says, she wants to be
		      with us  - it is neither a rough nor gentle voice, a 
		      neutral voice yet clearly male - for a second i see them
		      engaged in sexual frenzy - emotionless as if they are 
		      merely having intercourse to show me - suddenly she
		      walks right in front of me, i cannot really see her as
		      i could not see exactly what she was doing...she is
		      passing me from left to right, partly naked, partly 
		      bleeding...a third man enters the space from the right
		      and lays down on the floor as she silently straddles
		      him with her back to me - i near her and touch her which
		      seems to snap her out of the orgy mindset - she takes my
		      hand and we rush out to find there are no stairs, the whole
		      area is either under construction or being demolished - 
		      we jump without words onto the lower floor with the worry
		      that it will cave in - another turn and another jump to 
		      the ground floor without that worry - i see the exit,
		      three other men are crowding the doorway - a couple in 
		      military uniform - they move out of the way as we pass
		      through - it is bright outside, i don't like the sun and
		      don;t like the dream and awake...i was started contemplating
		      what it might mean - who it might be about - and now i 
		      see it also gives me the logical reason for my lack of trust -
		      even if i allow my faith to be confident in say miss x - 
		      who is to say that miss x will not be overtaken by others
		      and their scams or schemes...a drugged drink could sink
		      anyone nearly anywhere...i was concerned for lotta and
		      alexander, the first for the pre-dream thoughts and the
		      second as i now feel the irony of the word bottomless - 
		      in terms of those scenes - one could say sure honey i 
		      trust you but not the surroundings...i reckon it's even
		      more extreme in the case of daughters...daddy doesn't
		      sleep a wink knowing the dorm room key card is as flimsy
		      as a paper airplane...anyway, my rangoon point is;
		      objective, burma! 1945 - the burmese harp - 1956 -
		      escape to burma 1955 - a yank on the burma road 1945 -
		      bombs over burma 1942 - burma victory 1945 - rookies
		      in burma 1943 - moon over burma 1940  and burma cowboy 1941 -
		      to mention nine of the films that currently find themselves
		      in a sort of noun limbo due to 'myanmar' - i don't think
		      title editing or switching is an option...does then 
		      burma remain an irony or become exclusive to fiction...
		      dig one translation; birmania, so much more poetic...
		      worse is the capital hmm rangoon now yangon and further now naypyitaw,
		      previously called pyinmana...so even if you learnt your geography
		      correctly you would need to restudy it as if nothing is ever settled,
		      unsettling...yet i do not intend to make light of the dark time
		      that place is being put through - like the idea of a missing child
		      or a drug induced assault, i cannot wholly imagine the burden of
		      such a nightmare yet i wonder if it will make France go well 
		      these two billion francs that we are pouring into the kiev
		      puppet dictatorship could be more useful to myanmar-burma people
		      at present...even if i would take the money to fix the french
		      roads before anything myself...that is, "Roads in rural areas accounted for 60% 
		      of deaths and 48% of serious injuries in 2024, and 1,928 people were
		      killed on roads in rural areas (51 more than in 2023, i.e. +3%)."
		      from onisr.securite-routiere.gouv.fr but why would macron care if
		      part of the population is lost?

		      30 march<br>
		      <br>
		      eggless fried rice, i was too into 'walk like a dragon' to worry or
		      wonder if it meant anything...later finding mel torme's comin' home baby...
		      the film and the song are gems...nobu atsumi mccarthy played kim sung in 
		      that 1960 film...obviously i need to review her credits for the film
		      list, but suddenly there is also bruce glover and richard chamberlain...
		      i believe he was involved with some james clavell project, ie the director
		      of 'walk like a dragon'...the thing is i need to get other things together
		      as well...shave, dishes, well yeah me and the dishes all need shaving - 
		      i also want to eat and i have been wanting to eat since last night - 
		      somehow it is already early afternoon turning late - i need to keep
		      calm and remember i can do it all in a couple of hours - i only slept
		      a couple of hours when i awoke from the dream wherein i was looking
		      at myself yet my face was robyn's...robyn stephens...at that point i 
		      was trying to send crispin spiritual condolences...lamenting i had
		      not seen his hotel movie...but still thinking about the fried rice, 
		      and to some extent lotta who had taken the oyster bar trip - 
		      i went to sleep after a few cigarettes and coffee and slept through
		      the morning only somewhat concerned that i would be late for her
		      sunday video...i didn't look at the mirror when i did rise again
		      after dreaming of looking through a jewelry box that held no 
		      real interest for me...they say diamonds are a girl's best friend
		      but i only partly believe that logic...so myabe i do resemble 
		      robyn, but i will be sure upon shaving - as it is i am only
		      making light of the dream since i am not as handsome as she is
		      beautiful...when i got to the video i thought lotta was beautifully
		      frantic...she was having a japanese meal, but i got the feeling
		      there was something else she wanted to say...i hope she gets
		      a gig to tokyo, i suspect she will even feel at home there...
		      anyway she said a lot but i couldn't come to any conclusions...
		      it was much like the style presented right before her second
		      trip to paris...well, i suppose it's a wait and see situation -
		      i guess there's a lot more i could say-tell yet silence is still
		      golden...i reckon to come full circle in this jot-scribble, the
		      only jewelry i wear is a ring i self-made from a stainless steel
		      spoon with the triangle there and the label No.305 china...middle
		      finger of the right hand, that side's thumb partner when the plectrum
		      is in play.

		      31 march<br>
		      <br>
		      Monday. I had - as I suppose many or most logical folks do - forgot
		      the fact that the ending of life's contract is death. This music
		      played despite the near-daily dive into the obituary sections of
		      sometimes several publications. In this case, I am speaking about
		      the Korean series with Park So-Dam entitled Death's Game...
		      Maybe I should have taken my suspicion more seriously when I 
		      happened to feel the sensation of fear as someone began talking
		      of a parade they were viewing via the television...Oh no, I 
		      thought and translated my opposition to the matter suggesting
		      church, it was Sunday, or the Flinstones...Now, when I found
		      the show, I remembered the time I had spent looking for it so 
		      as not to miss Park's work - having seeing most everything else...
		      I took in three or four episodes after cleaning the kitchen and
		      the argument with nobody in particular that I had ordered a five
		      piece meal and had only got four...She plays death the premise
		      is a suicide being punished by having to experience dying a 
		      dozen times until going to hell unless he can escape in one
		      of the incarnations...it's brilliant but I kept thinking how
		      stupidly the character reacted after living as a student he
		      finds himself in jail yet does not think to survive - to
		      escape instead going head first into battles which in themselves
		      could get him killed or consequently thereafter resurface as
		      vengeance but it was a hard luck character and perhaps that
		      balances it like being incarnated into a baby...well, i should
		      wait to evaluate it when it is concluded...they term it a thriller
		      and there it is thrilling but i could not help thinking, dude,
		      shave your head, pretend to be a monk or something, and duck
		      away from everything and everyone...perhaps it is what the 
		      writers intended you to think - i will try to get through it
		      later today. Monday. I had - as I suppose some guitarists do -
		      gone through my ritual while being baffled by the chameleon character -
		      then once again skipped working on the list which will be the first
		      thing i get to after this note...it's one of those jobs that, for me,
		      require a certain amount of inspiration - a disposition or inclination
		      since sometimes an image comes into play and while art might be
		      thrown together this way or that it seems i prefer to have the feeling
		      first...since feeling is first...who pays any attention to a battery
		      wrapped in a white t-shirt put placed next to the electricity counters
		      with the dislodged metal door in the building...i had thrown out the
		      trash and found that so very strange...stranger still was the sensation,
		      like a rush of contradictions upon going to bed...collar bone pain as
		      if being pressed or pressured...both sides, right and left in that
		      order and then what can only be called a migraine - bursting throb
		      of temple anguish so bad i got up to see if there was breaking news...
		      the cell phone notified me of a fire in bishop and i figured it was
		      that since now flames in california feel as if they could go out of
		      control - i had been thinking of jihoon yet that makes it sound as
		      if i were in control...i was not, the thought was there as if intent
		      on telling me something but the beethoven in me kept me blind...
		      i actually made more coffee and had a few cigarettes before imagining
		      the fire being settled and the evacuations reversed...in my dream,
		      i'm with a grey version of jerry garcia and there are other guys
		      from the band and he is rolling a cigarette most likely weed which
		      i am expecting to puff upon - he leaves a leaf like section squared
		      out for no reason like he's using e z wider and made the joint with
		      one wing...weir smokes after him and he smokes again then hands me
		      the thing halfway done and wingless yet still nowhere near a so-called
		      roach - i take a rich few seconds watching the ember shine and hand the
		      thing to weir thinking that is how it should go - i might have woken up
		      then surprised over the scene - i'd seen videos of the dead and co where
		      garcia's alligator strat was being played on stage...it's a trip in itself
		      to gaze upon it...for me, a divided sensation, like man that is cool to
		      see but also like man that's jerry's axe...a few weeks ago i had entertained
		      the idea of decorating one of my guitars in that fashion, there are even
		      sets of sitckers on sale which have the alligator, harley davidson, and
		      police helper decal all included...but i thought it would be disrespectful
		      and opted for my own design scheme...i might have awoken but i was still
		      drowsy enough to not notice reality then found myself dreaming again, this
		      time a woman, at her place - we are standing there talking...i am telling
		      a story that now escapes me - something of a prank i pulled on someone - 
		      she seems terribly excited by the notion of my wicked humor - i have
		      the sense that it is dakota yet i am acting and she is too as if we had
		      met before, like a friend...well, maybe we are friendly - the scene is
		      flying, like time is on speed...in a wink of an eye i find myself returning -
		      although i never felt myself leaving - walking into the building, i would
		      say hotel but there are several many or even a lot of buildings with doormen -
		      this one seems to be on friendly terms with dakota or the woman in the
		      dream as i reach the elevator he queries so did you really pull that prank
		      on your own...i grin and confess in the positive to his curious countenance 
		      not thinking how or why or even much about privacy - was it a private story
		      i shared with her - is anything private anymore, was it ever...there's
		      no business like show business should have been playing but instead the 
		      elevator turned into a staircase and i was carrying a packpack with lettuce -
		      her roommate or someone near enough to answer her door sprung out informing
		      me that the food was nearly done and i turned for her to grab the lettuce
		      so that there'd be salad too - i could see fish and chicken being fried
		      separately, she asked like you only ever used to hear on airplanes - 
		      if i wanted the chicken or the fish - always in fear of bad seafood, i 
		      said the chicken of course. i got up then - greeted the cat, skirt has
		      had a few days where he takes to making sure i am here or there then the
		      speech about how things are going with him which usually ends upon 
		      the nilk and friskies...i felt myself blaming the combination of mother's
		      good wishing irony and david lynch's missing pieces for something or other
		      but then came to my senses not with an apology since it still might be true
		      but why bother - why make it a thing, if it was even my thing...indeed since
		      feeling is first...further into now. the blame even when blatant is always
		      a point of view...that is to say even if someone kills you, it's up to you
		      to die. 
		      <br>
		      <br>
		      april one <br>
		      <br>
		      i'm looking at the overturned penske truck on kneeland and harrison
		      in boston;s chinatown...i had a minute ago been dreaming of vicmary,
		      i don't really know her much but i sure felt myself rubbing my crotch
		      against her knee behind her mother's back...i'd been exhausted, having
		      got up early after going to bed late - even a chord i long ago knew
		      and took for granted became unfamiliar...what is that...imagine that
		      the g major a sudden mystery on the seventh fret...i knew then i was
		      in need of rest and relaxation...in way of clearing up what might be
		      a confusing statement, it was the jackson flying v which itself presents
		      the fretboard to me as if new...but still, once in a while the only thing
		      to do is hit the hay...hey hey my my...of course the main thing i thought
		      about was this couple of paragraphs from the los angeles times:
		      "Ancient Bristlecone Pine Forest, home to the oldest trees in the world, 
		      is in the White Mountains, about 20 miles east of Bishop, and is threatened by the fire,
		      according to Cal Fire spokesperson Chloe Castillo. So far, none have been destroyed in the blaze.

Some of these trees are more than 4,000 years old and still growing, dating to the Bronze Age. The forest
		      includes the Methuselah Tree, which may be the oldest living organism on Earth. 
		      In an effort to protect the tree, the U.S. Forest Service does not disclose its exact location..."
		      but yes, also the fact the rest of my 'haul' was sent out and is due to be shipped
		      out in a day day two...i am concerned over the date since it might arrive
		      on or about holy week...but hopefully by the end of this april i will get
		      my guitars set up in the fashion i wanted or wished...
		      where was i ah yes death's game, it got wicked good although i felt there
		      was bit too much mothering near the end but that might be for what i am going
		      through and intellectually it is wonderful to see drama take the time
		      to tell a woman's story in full...so i can fully recommend this series
		      without hesitation. later in my dream i was walking with a woman down 
		      a hundred and ninth street - the cathedral building might be entered or
		      exited from there or a hundred and tenth...i thought it was mother but
		      now i am not so sure as it was dark night and i was walking the way i 
		      usally did before someone pointed out how it appeared to them, that is
		      to say not exactly looking up, head bowed - eyes upon the pavement - 
		      in the dream it was like that but i could see my legs and her legs and
		      she said she wanted to pee as if i were the parent and she were a child -
		      so we stopped and she half squatted - i noticed the stream, i noticed
		      too lights as if police car coming up the hill - that streets when walking
		      eastward feels like you are in san francisco steepness or something
		      as it leads you into a more level central park and east side beyond -
		      we cross i suppose for no exact reason except one of my songs about
		      buying cocaine is set in that place - she starts to piss again and 
		      it is more than i can explain - well like a horse...i awake thinking
		      how strange and feeling as if i had been put through a work out instead
		      of dreaming...at least i had obtained a carton of the cigarettes i wanted,
		      cleaning my room some i waited to hear from the other place which did 
		      call but only to report that yet again they had not re-stocked. 
		      i was shocked by alpha dog a few times, in that it was a true story -
		      in that i didn;t recognize anton yelchin, in how angelic amanda was and
		      is and most likely will be...also the only part of it i actually enjoyed.
		      well, at least for trivia it had one of the few mentions of paraguay in
		      cinema...funny, i can see the view from my three k room, the lights
		      from the renovated buildings on 109th street and my thoughts wondering
		      if the curtains were indeed covering the window - martin made a ceo 
		      guitar and i told caitlin erin oneill about it, she actually liked it.
		      i have made unsettled plans to go to paris on air france with julia
		      mecey but i can't figure out how to handle all the details...even
		      for a few days i think the cat would freak out...well, this can all
		      be settled later on down the line...for now i will surely try the
		      axe again concentrating on the g major so as to get that glitch 
		      out of my system...then again it may simply be that i was telling
		      more truth than i thought when mentioning that certain 'new' techniques
		      felt as if i were starting to learn the instrument all over again...
		      ps, acid pro wroted back without an exact resolution yet i deployed
		      my concern in other words and hopefully they will get that vst scan
		      fixed in proper fashion. 
		      <br>
		      <br>
		      april two<br>
		      <br>
		      i thought later maybe ihad got - hey when will apple make an ihad-
		      hmm, ihead...ihold...ihide...well i was thinking maybe i had got
		      mixed up with the lady from the bank that phoned right before i 
		      went back to the guitar - it was for someone else but later in 
		      the evening i found myself dreaming of some type of bank work -
		      but i haven't met that woman...no other dream to report after 
		      being startled by the notification that val kilmer had passed
		      away...the director of heat had just been talking about the
		      sequel...i was thinking of that film and tombstone although
		      the only real memory i keep about the vk, is the riot he 
		      caused in me when he did the narration for some film as
		      an added feature...it was more powerful than drugs, i literally
		      could not stop laughing...in fact it's one of the few things
		      i remember about the apartment on sarasota...all this to say
		      it is next to impossible to feel sorrow, even upon his death,
		      when my thoughts rush to that joyous moment and still make
		      me smile or even giggle...no i was not giggling over the 
		      news, but i am confident you get the point...even in telling
		      my side of the story here, it is that pleasure that remains...
		      now then, feeling the ease of being rested, i brought myself
		      to one of my axes with an outlook on the together notes we
		      term chords...given the seventh fret incident, but i found
		      no issue and i suppose it will be a one-off thing i can
		      torture myself with...sure, you are good but remember the
		      time you forgot that g major on the seventh fret, hahaha...
		      and so on...it'a a good thing guitar players don't need
		      to de-classify their scale and chord dossier to themselves
		      before playing...i had heard black bag was a decent film
		      and made immediate plans to view it - i made soup and tried
		      to not think about how excited kevin and kyra had been...
		      later i understood how a married couple could, would or did
		      find this exceptional...my thought was why are some australian
		      actresses so darn good - bravo, cate - along with trying to recall where i had
		      seen the male protagonist - ah yeah, the killer, 2023...dang
		      that seems so long ago...i didn't put place pepper in the broth
		      this time and either i was too hungry to miss it or maybe it is
		      merely overkill given the oregano...i played guitar again - no
		      mail order mystics in d or i smell smoke in g minor - simply fiddling
		      through nothing in particular and trying to rid myself of the
		      weird pressure i feel as if being pushed to 'perform' where it
		      is not my intent...my goal is to keep up with the ritual...
		      to which i have added a bit of chord work since i haven;t really
		      tried a song since deep elem blues except for the exploration into
		      all of me in b flat - early in the afternoon i felt flat and further
		      flattened myself on one of the beds for nap although i had been flat
		      on my back while watching the spy thriller on the sofa...i took
		      that nap yet without any exact dream as if i were thinking or overthinking
		      until getting up to find that it was yet very early in the day...
		      maria posted a picture of a horse, then herself with the same horse
		      and for a minute i felt the desire to create art again yet it has
		      yet to become a catalyst - like my idea for marie anne;s picture...
		      or even the film list which i did update without including any new
		      photographs or animations...i hope one of these days i will feel
		      that feeling once more and delve into it to have some sort of completion.
		      i know that i will never have a good a time, in terms of what is now
		      often called LOL, as i did with val's hilarious narration once upon a
		      time...
		      <br>
		      <br>
		      april five<br>
		      <br>
		      a saturday ah saturday aha saturday i suppose i should surrender
		      to something or other yet there's nothing specific on my mind
		      leading me this way or that...i've been playing a fair amount
		      of guitar somehow going against my decision to work on a daily
		      song...by that i merely mean repeating one in varying or different
		      ways in order to feed that aspect of music...i think it was
		      diamond joe, the other time i did that although obviously
		      i did consider deep elem blues a bit but that was a recorded
		      practice or exercise - i didn't continue with it as i did with
		      the other...well, i suppose i need to find one appealing enough
		      to fit into that definition...before going to bed last night
		      i read that story about the nurse, she had been trying to have
		      a child for a couple of years, hailey also a popular social 
		      media person they say, but according to reports died moments
		      after giving birth to a son...i suppose i was more upset for
		      the child than for her yet in any case a heartbreaking ending
		      to life for her and an anguishing start to life for him...
		      here i have yet to find the inspiration to fill in the picture
		      side things and i have had a few dream scenes which i will
		      make note of subsequently but i have not felt a connection to
		      them instead i have felt them as if something or someone were
		      trying to pull on the puppet strings of rapid eye movement - 
		      which is the reason for waiting before jotting them...i think
		      i mentioned earlier the contradiction of sitting around without
		      anyone in mind yet finding it crowded or a crowd when going
		      to sleep...i have the weirdest time trying to answer why that
		      would be - trying to decipher it - in the film becoming led
		      zeppelin there is one scene with a revolving door next to the
		      performing platform...i'd say the pre-dream moments have been
		      like some sort of revolving door, faces - some seductive some
		      returning yet not in the dreams themselves...i understand that
		      at a certain time certain people might want a certain thing 
		      and possibly hide behind someone like me in order to gain
		      whatever the vantage point might be...or so i reckon as i 
		      ponder the bizarre matter...in any case, the film was 
		      amazing for the very simple fact that it makes you realize
		      how beautifully intense music might be...you might say
		      yeah, but if you delve deeper then you find that these
		      songs exists within memory and beyond it - with many or
		      most other bands, there is often an invisible time stamp -
		      perhaps when it was discovered or maybe the event wherein
		      it became entagled or caught up in...so while logically
		      i should relate some riffs with say carol miller i don't
		      because these blues are too much to be boxed into a get
		      the led out episode you see - in the film there is a 
		      juxtaposition of a carnival type concert tent and the 
		      nasa exploration of the lunar surface but listening to
		      the song you get that it is before and after that time
		      and place...like it had always been and always will be -
		      now i will contradict my idea by saying that going to 
		      california is unlike all the others time-stamped for
		      me since it is one of the first songs i learnt and 
		      let in my then lover to listen...when i did get to 
		      los angeles i never thought of her or them or even the
		      song...still the idea feels true despite the 
		      possible anomaly - the movie ended and i wished it had
		      gone on a few more hours until in through the out door or
		      coda...i was thanking the genesis groove that brought
		      jimmy page to the yardbirds and got led zeppelin going -
		      i was feeling extra good over my kramer since eddie of
		      that name had helped to put together the second album -
		      now when i think of mothership i will recall how it was
		      john paul jones' mother that insisted he go and try to 
		      join that band although he was rather a success already
		      as a session player...in my own playing i need to stop
		      trying to compensate for the sound by pressure at the
		      pick strum or even fret hold when it is not amplified...
		      otherwise i will continue to develop two differing styles
		      without a need for it - i had dreams of my uncle without
		      rhyme or reason which held nothing to note and possibly
		      were more about my sister than myself given her current
		      relationship and the fact that it is a known pitfall in
		      her life which i suspect she has been trying to escape
		      for a while now even once having her work laptop wind
		      up in his town upon being left in a car going in that
		      direction or so i heard anyway waking up she was on my
		      mind and that is how i came to this conclusion - contrary
		      to anything it seems, i again dreamt i was in three k,
		      the kitchen there was a short narrow hall next to the
		      front door and opposite the entrance closet - i was 
		      bent down trying to entice some rodent or roach out of 
		      the cabinet crawl space by pouring clorox as i stepped
		      back instead a man with the face of a panther alike
		      the cat people feline towered over me but suddenly 
		      disappeared as a woman emerged dressed in black as 
		      if julie newmar from the original series - i fell
		      to my kness and asked what i could do in terms of
		      saving myself from this conundrum she said you must
		      be poor of power...maybe it was pour our power...i'm
		      not sure i had been in the living room before as if 
		      it mirrored my now space instead of guitars - people
		      lined up on of them i distinctly did not like - she
		      was brunette and i didn't recognize her - i awoke thinking
		      of the switch box that i believe held the label bryant
		      park - brian might have been in the dream but that part 
		      was vague and i have not seen or heard from him in a
		      considerable stretch...i got up a bit distracted and
		      lingered or loitered with a lazy directionless feeling
		      until i thought about naomi...she brought to mind the
		      only other naomi i have ever met - well i'm not counting
		      watts - who used to install herself in aunt's 36 house for
		      coffee and conversation...one of the kids once put placed
		      exlax in the brew making her exit nearly instantly - i admit
		      it was kind of funny seeing someone limp in a hurry - i never
		      asked or knew what exactly was the matter with her leg...i
		      remember her house as pretty european for san francisco...
		      having been there once on orders to help move something or
		      other...well, i had some other dreams that didn't want to
		      be recalled although i did awake thinking to write it down -
		      drowsy and then dreaming again it was evening in the city,
		      a street without cars, several people scattered but none
		      of us moving...a woman rushed up to me with a knife and
		      stabbed me under the right collar bone somehow missing
		      ribs as it went in smooth...startled but not hurt i got 
		      up thinking about jennifer...the actress not the swede...
		      i'm not familiar with pjharvey's pocket knife...hmm, maybe
		      it was acdc jealousy...
		      "Who your leader? Who your man?
Who will help you fill your hand?
Who's your friend and who's your foe?
Who's your Judas? You don't know..." still, why was i standing there watching
		      her cross the avenue and come at me as if a dream, well
		      a dream within a dream...in other words if you see someone
		      arrive at your nearness with a weapon do make an effort to
		      not wait and see as it might be result like that...
		      what is love? feeling accomplished that someone you admire
		      was in your dream and left a wound. what a wonderful world...
		      <br>
		      <br>
		      april six<br>
		      <br>
		      i found myself in the middle of the road yet again, 
		      this time in the dream i was seemingly heading out,
		      i wore a suit and there was a woman walking with me
		      on the left side, we stepped off the walkway as if to
		      wait for a taxi cab, she wore a contrasting light dress
		      that is to my dark suit, and i asked her how she felt
		      to which she answered that felt the cold biting at her 
		      skin - the gown was sleeveless and i removed my blazer
		      and put placed it across her shoulders - she smiled
		      and i awoke...i'm pretty sure it was cathedral parkway
		      yet i cannot be certain as the scene only focused on
		      her and myself...earlier i had dreamt of aunt eva yet
		      in such a vague manner that no details emerge from it
		      and if i were to attempt a note it would be more about
		      other memories than any dream itself...my thoughts were
		      not crowded and my rest was fuller given ten milligrams
		      of some sleep potion...however, in pre-dream thoughts
		      i was confronted by the nearby sounds of a man sneezing,
		      a dog barking, and a woman laughing as if not so much 
		      entertained but to be heard...i even got up and looked
		      at westcreek guitars now somehow more interesting given
		      their free international shipping policy...i kept my
		      robe on when i went back to bed, back to sleep and 
		      awoke to a weird nocturnal emission without any memory
		      of a wet dream..."All these years, I've been wanderin' around
Wonderin' how come nobody told me
All that I been lookin' for was somebody who looked like you..." i imagine
		      it wasn't even during an erection as the wetness was 
		      well below the thigh...in the opposite direction of
		      the erection as i awoke...talk about someone pulling
		      your leg...sure i thought of lotta and her porn star
		      martini...girls night out, felicitas had one too, 
		      the sight of her friend with a spiderweb shoulder tattoo
		      was intense...i was not about staying awake and pondering
		      or wondering the who what how or why - no point in crying
		      over proverbial spilled milk - i knew part of the where,
		      at least my part...but i also knew that i had not had
		      a good night's sleep in a few days...i felt however
		      easier in the fact that i didn't sense the crowding...
		      sure julia and julia came to mind and india and jihoon
		      too but it all felt contained...to some extent logical -
		      i viewed lotta's new video, but i felt someone else's
		      seduction - as if being pulled away somehow...i thought
		      it can't be her but was not sure who else it might be -
		      laura sophia went for her sunday run and i went to sleep
		      where the dreams were easy yet nothing exact to report
		      herein...unlike aunt's sequence, these were all very
		      quick moments as if racing against each other in some
		      rapid eye movement juxtaposition...once in a while, sitting
		      around with a coffee and cigarette later they do return
		      to mind but i don't think it will be the case today...
		      i'm already well into further thoughts...i had meant
		      to mention that i viewed manhattan, the film  - not the
		      town...truly like visiting an old friend and getting
		      fired up at the thought that once upon a time you could
		      literally usher in the fall with a yearly woody allen
		      film...for many new yorkers it would have been a logical
		      ritual...i have a distant memory of attending one film,
		      maybe hannah and her sisters, and watching it from the
		      steps since the seats of the place were packed...gee, i
		      haven't actually been to a movie house since quantum 
		      of solace...that particular theater shut down so now
		      there is no nearby movie house...except my cell phone
		      as it were...speaking of which that is where i watched
		      mickey seventeen - this one is not for the hardened types
		      or the jaded ones, there is a poetry to it that requires
		      your inner child's emotion to hear it...i suppose i am
		      immature enough to have liked it although my grown up
		      parts were once in a while doing the math on suspicion
		      of how it was cast for broadcast...luckily its difficult
		      for me to succumb to gossip even when it seems to start
		      up in my own head...it's a good thing, since anytime
		      self-doubt strikes a pose i eventually shrug it off...
		      who me? ha! let me show self-doubt how much hubris i 
		      have in store...stop, there it is - i was spying in 
		      a dream as if perched upon a ventilation duct above
		      two mean looking 'guards' the word implies guardian
		      but from my experience they all mostly are do-nothing
		      but stare at others from their uniforms and sentry sounds so formal...too
		      formal, so i'm there in the dream not knowing why or
		      what - then in a sudden switch i am by the cashiers
		      who none of them have bags - it seems i had gone shopping,
		      there was a woman with me - one i cannot recall - and she
		      finds these plastic bags - two or three of them, they 
		      do not have the supermarket label instead doritos in 
		      big bold letters...i find that weird enough to have it
		      stick in my mind just like the colorful residue of those
		      chips make fingertips fuzzy...we pick up the shopping 
		      and leave...now this was the dream part i awoke from
		      in confusion and should have been wroted before but it
		      only came to mind now - lotta said she paid thirty five
		      euros for her soiree to the store...people, and perhaps
		      rightly so are concerned over the economy...myself
		      i think twice about ordering restaurant food not that
		      there are many places left to order from...a glimpse
		      at older yellow pages gives you a good idea of how they
		      have dwindled...so there is a sort of guilty feeling,
		      in that i am well aware that many others do not have
		      such options...yet hunger and not finding any thrill 
		      or satisfaction in the kitchen makes me go through
		      the motions of placing an order more often than i 
		      like or should...my desire for more guitars might
		      bring this to a natural conclusion since several 
		      orders would match the price of certain new axes...
		      and yet i will most likely be going against my
		      own logic in a while if only to escape the confines
		      of the kitchen...insane to think that soul kitchen
		      is one my favorite songs..."Well, the clock says
		      it's time to close now. I guess I'd better go now..."
		      ps, wadsworth bryant & bulldog panel, i missed mentioning
		      that would have been the name of the electrical circuit
		      i was thinking about two days ago.

		      april seven<br>
		      <br>
		      i couldn't find my way into dreams like i wanted,
		      that is early...i got up and played around with
		      guitar town, peggy sue, and lost highway...
		      lennon did it in c and i knew it was weird
		      but i didn't really react to my own instict
		      until later, for the ironic record, lost highway
		      is in d but eventhough that would be more natural
		      for my voice, it's in e that i feel it works...
		      in any case all that to say i am fiddling around
		      with songs as a whole even bringing vocals into
		      play...i suppose i am excited over the coming 
		      haul...held a bizarre dream as i watched a man
		      undress before me...there was a sense that i knew
		      who it was although i didn't except that the person
		      i thought it was then produced other scattered thoughts
		      but i didnt feel any interest in it - as if someone
		      was trying to mock or pass judgement...on him that
		      is...as i was barely aware of the proceedings or their
		      meaning except like i said i thought for a minute it
		      knew who it might be - the phone rang a dozen times
		      and i twirled in bed thinking surely someone had 
		      passed away to get me this much ringing and i opted
		      to get up only to hear it was for the transaction that
		      was sent friday and was to arrive soon...i'm supposed
		      to go out shopping but i have no inclination for it...
		      coffee, cigarettes, mining, collecting points, and
		      social media glances...does anyone know if the tiktok
		      messages are real...i mean, wouldn't you check out
		      the link and drop a line via email...or has email gone
		      out of style...it's only for spam notes, possibly...
		      the schools were are closed in germany and dylan grant
		      died...the bull rider, they called him...i thought of
		      emilee of course and even keira then obviously gotta
		      serve somebody bob...lotta had got up very early and
		      gone to the gym for pilates...by the time i got around
		      to her posting she was already wondering what to do with
		      the rest of her day...for some reason i did not feel any
		      emotion, as if i had not seen her somehow...suddenly
		      i felt a very powerful emotion from mariia ariia...as 
		      if she was trying to hold me or hold on to me...she's
		      the type of woman that makes all the fuss the beatnik
		      poet poured out about holiness make sense - i suppose
		      it;s a void of evil purity...to put it in simpler in
		      terms, if i met a dog it would most likely not be friendly
		      and if she met a dog it would most likely fall in love...
		      in fact, i've seen it happen...a complete stranger of
		      a canine entirely gone gaga over seeing her as if saying
		      take me home with you...so i was happy for a minute that
		      i at least knew about her and so on...she posted one 
		      possible definition of the bra you might imagine tom
		      was talking about when singing about kathleen in filipino
		      box spring hog and i guess that augmented my excitement -
		      then i found she had gone in to get an ear piercing...
		      it was all too much for me and i listened to vince lee
		      and sophie lord doing drop down mama...sleepy john estes,
		      i hadn't knowd it before...thought it was cool...i made
		      a grilled cheese thing and had it with chips and a sprite -
		      phoned mother still wondering how she came to her point
		      of view in terms of children...unless they are your 
		      kids i don't want to deal with them...i put placed
		      black market baby cover on the main page...thinking
		      about the sharon tate dancing video i had edited for it...
		      the something about seeing joan collins sent me down the
		      release road for easter...ie, that should be out soon,
		      maybe even in time for its namesake date...i hope to
		      clean up the house and then reward myself with an onion
		      and lettuce salad drenched in lime juice and olive oil
		      but the clean up does make me hesitate, some cook some
		      do not cook, some things cannot be altered...
		      post-script, i skipped through something called dreamland,
		      a title with margot robbie - she wasn't bad, but the
		      film cannot be called good...if memory serves she played
		      sharon tate in some other not so memorable or merely ironic film...
		      anyway by this pojnt i got through the main points of my cleaning
		      plan...i listened to johnny winters, serious business...the first
		      three tracks; master mechanic - sound the bell - and murdering blues.
		      i had prior to that heard him talking about his influences and
		      playing style...when he mentioned the thumb-pick, i was reminded
		      of the actual manner in which i awoke - my right side thumb had
		      part of the nail fractured on the outer side and there was a 
		      splinter poking the inner side top part...one of those mysteries
		      that would be impossible to explain -- i thought of the line,
		      i have an awareness in my thumb, i put placed the still brand new
		      tweezers to work...pulling out the stabbing thread and yet not
		      knowing what it could be or how it went down - i even saved it to
		      secure some knowledge but it is such a flimsly thing, like wire
		      like wood...a sliver of a thing without an exact voice yet powerful
		      enough to sting...as the songs wailed i wondered if the ghost of
		      johnny winter was asking me to give the thumbpick another try...
		      i liked it for the tight hold it held and it would be darn difficult
		      to drop while playing but i'm not into the finger pluck or picking
		      as it feels less controlled than the flatpick - still, when he
		      spoke about the slide i did learn that his was a pipe - neither
		      glass (he could never get a bottle neck to break right) nor brass would do for him and he liked the full range of it
		      since it covered all six strings...i've made a few and even got a 
		      new one recently but i think i will try his idea down the line,
		      in terms of the slide...hmm, seen zztop play it on the middle finger,
		      a rare set up - that i did try already and it's pretty enjoyable to 
		      have the index and ring free not to mention the pinky...

		      april ten<br>
		      <br>
		      there was nobody to run against josiah quincy the third,
		      ie, ninety seven percent of the vote in boston, mass.
		      a shoe holds - bless you - the foot, hopefully far
		      from the mouth. weeze is a breathing noise, but
		      also a quiet town in germany. the weezer wife
		      was filmed while being shot by the los angeles
		      police department and they said booked for murder...
		      the battle of mocopulli saw the so-called patriots
		      fail to overtake the royalist, south of here, in
		      chile lands over the hills and far away...
		      there's nobody to indict when a natural catastrophe
		      gives folks a great big bear hug...i'd somehow
		      not thought of the line by the pricking of my
		      thumb something wicked this way comes - when i 
		      awoke from a whirlwind of dreams - champagney is
		      where in france the saint-louis coal mine disaster
		      killed twenty and injured sixteen...later i wondered
		      who the hell goes to a night club on a monday night
		      as the stray bits of news insisted on my listening -
		      i used to go by there a lot but for the burger king
		      not the dancing...the place looked sturdy and therefore
		      i concluded it was a supernatural happening...but like
		      the myanmar lands formerly known as burma, nobody cares
		      too much...it's not like tariffs or celebrity scandals...
		      death tolls of three thousand sixty and death tolls of
		      two hundred twenty one are talked about without soul -
		      hmm two hundred...yes some of these things mentioned 
		      went down two hundred years three months and eight
		      days ago...just off howard mill road, the defoor apartments
		      has its own website...yes, 1824defoor dot com - 
		      the red cross pickup truck was trying to manipulate
		      traffic as i missed the fact that i had just passed
		      italia fifteen, speaking of real estate, on my way
		      back from a convoluted cigarette run - taking us to style;
		      for women; waistlines were on the descent, 
		      as the "Empire" silhouette vanished...
		      the dropping waistline gave way to wider skirts and sleeves...
		      for the non-productive sex, the trousers were a narrow
		      fit reaching the shoe top yet wide-cut cossacks pants 
		      became a variation which were pleated into a waistband
		       fitted to the ankle all inspired the Czar visiting London
		      a decade before...by the following year trousers had fully
		      dethroned their predecessor, pantaloons...how many places
		      are there and how many for a poet...i reckon the poet
		      has only one place that is to say his muse...in the last
		      couple of days i've been here and there, stockholm,
		      athens, new york, los angeles, berlin, but somehow like
		      the general i always find myself returning to my west point,
		      the room with a milwalkee poster although i had no uniform
		      three k...in pre-dream scenes i can only say i saw a woman
		      in a naked blur as if taking a picture of herself, myself
		      i have no dreams lately to report possibly for overthinking -
		      although winona i thought had moved in to what was sister's
		      room and later the storage space where i found yohimbe among
		      other things yet it could have been rachel...then last night
		      there again but in the main bedroom a woman with legs that
		      seemed to go on and on impossibly so i tranced out in the
		      gaze of her maze and awoke thinking of the t-rex song
		      jewel...austrian airlines tells me they still have meal
		      options...theatre am karntnertor, vienna is where the
		      choral was first heard by the crowd...D minor Op. 125,
		      you would know it as the ninth symphony...i imagine
		     james pink, my brother, as an all powerful angel, allows
		      me to go beyond the mere present and into before, so i dedicate
		      this to him with the apology that it isn;t an ode to joy.
		      <br>
		      there will be nobody to race against when you have gone
		      the distance.

		      Carolina meet but me I did kiss her calf.<br>
Jackson West methinks North Carolina.<br>
I said lyrics so maybe it was a rally.<br>
While more seriously to Sierra Levesque.<br>
that came to mind even while John Wick,<br>
Film series Johnny Depp durned town.<br>
The shower was steaming in three k,<br>
Aunt laly at the door asking for pills.<br>
<br>
We dream, butt stained fruit of the loom.<br>
Then wonder why or how, refrain jewel.<br>
how in e minor. yes i said no, he knew<br>
a wizard in france, i recall mother<br>
cleaning father's...brian seltzer<br>
learnt a new trick...i recall the<br>
whiskey soaked lawyer bragging that<br>
since being married he did nto have<br>
to even touch his underwear a woman's<br>
work is never done...<br>

At the fireside, lotta stood i was sad and lonely,<br>
often will the bosom swell with sadness <br>
at remembrance of the faraway ole what does it signify<br>
how our noble dior fell to its knees for jihoon<br>
how I thought of deep purple's my woman from tokyo<br>
I never wear boxers or shorts, you are my drug <br>
replays telling me you like this one...<br>
And uphold wanted more ID of the same ID<br>
so I pulled out my guns and shot them down<br>
thanks so much for pulling my bank and never<br>
telling me about the trip to london or the<br>
full extent of earning options...like the tariff<br>
talk the irony is that many or most of the americans
are in the china lands...<br>
Indeed I was upheld before anyone repelled it on reddit.<br>
<br>
True, it is a lost option of wreaths <br>
Evermore but this is about my dreams,<br>
they soothe me none yet not anguish only,<br>
a cardboard box upon my head maybe it<br>
Sleep today said d-dairy-oh - noseless,<br>
In the alien narrow breath.<br>
Dirges silent, I had seen my own memories<br>
of affairs with lilia yet the ufo army<br>
will have none of it since the name coincides<br>
with a quack doctor's wife and since they don't<br>
read any books, partial lobotomies suit them fine...<br>
let him mingle with snot and worry.<br>
<br>
Who needs any further fantasy or love when you <br>
have vague dreams interrupted by the clatter...<br>
how am i so happy still, because i am not them -<br>
because i do not seek what you have to hide...<br>
there was a road and i was going somewhere yet<br>
it wasn't with anybody i knew or wanted to know.<br>
Arguments over homosexuality, but they can't admit<br>
it is hardly an option when society needs to hunt<br>
for food to survive...beyond that everyone gay<br>
will wipe out the human race unless test-tube<br>
babies and clones might be perfected...nevermind<br>
religion - still, why ask me? i could see some<br>
sense in lesbianism but not so much well, imagine<br>
yourself married to bukowski...but who knows perhaps<br>
charlie might be your cup of tea...i'm all for population<br>
control, but bombs are so much faster, see dresden.<br>
<br>
So i'm standing there in the middle of the night<br>
without desire in a dead breeze after a light rain,<br>
asking myself am I meant to wait...did I let it go<br>
too late...it's only eleven on the west coast.<br>
<br>
The puzzle reveals no further pieces, no barefoot contessa<br>
crying over the Italian army letter...i can see a hundred<br>
and sixth street where Humphrey used to live, I don't know<br>
where Ava made her home although I think with Howard Hughes<br>
and Sinatra sometimes...in between west end avenue and<br>
broadway...it would have been so different then...it must<br>
be so different now even from what i knew...<br>
<br>
I get up, the noise an irk and the erection wanting to pee -<br>
everything gets quiet then i get coffee, the friskies scatter<br>
some onto the floor as i pour, but skirt - the cat - is now<br>
mostly only interested in milk...like an addict...i smoke<br>
the cigarette and like U2 i still haven't found what I'm<br>
looking for...<br>
<br>
i try to write it all down here yet the jigsaw still jolts me - <br>
like the stranger that twists my left leg as if knitting a mockery...<br>
in repetition of charlie horse sea childhood swim into dry land<br>
i suppose it's that some folks can't stand thinking you have<br>
something they don't...not that i understand, but it was always<br>
the case...lucky for me, I have my druid self and you, dear reader<br>
not to mention eternity.<br>

		      april fourteen<br>
		      <br>
he killed three men with a pencil - i watched all four john wick films,
there's only a hint of weather in them...not a mention of news...i think
they are better than i thought, the memory i had before this was how
much fun mother and i had watching the halle scenes...yesterday, (why
she had to go i don't know, she wouldn't say) arrival which i heard
great groovy things about but felt the build up was overkill and 
more than that i couldn't stop thinking about jeremy and the snow
plow story...that is to say i liked the idea but i couldn't recommend it.
of course i'd been distracted by lotta as if the madness of love or
desire had to drown itself in contradictions...i carelessly dedicated
hours to lies and truth and whatever is in between...not even playing
my guitars so much - i came to the conclusion that my emotions might
be overwhelming in that sense and that someone wanted to make me
me dance through them without music as it were...
i hardly dreamt then today as i got up still feeling utterly drowsy
i instead went back to sleep as the noon hour neared and again until
most of the afternoon had passed...it was within these moments that
encountered dreams once more - which i will attempt to recount here,
although the southern california tremor took me into other thoughts,
sidetracked or not i am trying to settle this note here and now -
my aunt's house was on the second floor of a two story house, the
entrance (downstairs) also served as a garage and it was therein
i was dreaming...i was put placing two little locks on perrier water
bottles, very intent on doing so although this operation had never
occured to me before dreaming, why was i locking this sparkling libation?
next door there was some ceremony i could not see, like a tribute and
i didn't want to go but there were two children under me and i pulled
one up and put him through to the other side...a car arrived and
one of my cousins with his family arrived but as they went up the
stairs they seemed to multiply that is more and more people went
up the flight of stairs...i had left the bottle and the lock and
greeted some of them, by a light touch on the arm...some looked at
me, a couple with disgust while others kept on their way...i did not recognize who they were but
it was well over a dozen...as i stood there watching the scene
clear, anya came down the stairs, she was leaving - i also touched 
her and she embraced me but in a distant fashion, fashion hmm, she
was dressed in white and the clothing covered her figure making her
seem heavier than i think she is or might be...as she reached the
front gate i asked if she needed a cab, she said she didn't and i
turned not to the sparkling water or upsatairs but to awake, i thought
about the amiga lock, a contraption made in spain, i had put placed
on that gate and how i lost it when the cousin removed it claiming
he couldn't contact me...it had always made me think of taissa but
being that it was an inanimate object i tried not to associate it
with anyone except now somewhere deep in the subconscious it must 
still hold some meaning that i unintentionally bestowed upon it -
of course it might have been that i was on the outskirts of moscow
at that instant and it reminded me of that setting like the farm
houses in samara remind me of grandmother's home in san francisco -
(been away so long i hardly knew the place gee it's good to be back home)
the dream took a turn north or west depending on what location it was...
i was in the city, i always think new york, but this was more like
one of those twons with a "main" street and upon that road i was
intent on following what might have been a married couple - they
went into a cafe or restaurant - i think now of the photograph
wherein lennon is walking out of la fortuna his red shirt matching
their awning, the uniformed driver holding the car door open, it's
an italian place now only in memory thar vinny and alice ran -
69 west seventy first street...to think of it now, i realize that
although i sauntered around that area a lot, i only once sensed
the hint of any ghost which made me feel as if i were running
instead of walking...when bram stoker tells you the dead travel
fast, it is no exaggeration, i believe...i also believe these
thoughts come up as the release of 'easter' looms near, song in
which i sing yeah yeah yeah his ghost wroted this song for me -
as it did feel that way for some reason or another restaurant
hawaii tango tangled up in a hunk of burning love, i suppose
the dream, if i may get back to my point, reflected my concern
for lotta as part of me wanted to know perhaps too much or maybe
felt jealous, i'm just a jealous guy...i order something and 
pretend to be thinking of something else...i can't actually see
them or even know who they are...it's like i'm not there in
a manner of speaking, the faces all empty, i am invisible and
they are all strangers anyway...i suspect i left the detective
mind set and then awoke...i felt well-rested and thought about
lotta's new video wondering if it was in response to what i 
had told her...eye had toad here - frog saw swim...these creatures
have cures that science has yet to decipher...i can't translate
why i do not feel the inclination to create art in terms of 
graphics...i only know it would be incorrect to do so without
feeling inspired...i don't think it will be today - my timex
was three days behind the date - winding it up to speed i 
wondered and also saw how the scalpel picking could be played
out as if one of the guitars were calling...i find i prefer
guitar town to all of me, as a routine, but i'm not sure.
perhaps this hesitation haze will only conclude after the
other guitar arrives...or some dream that will turn the tide.

		      <br>
		      now then allen was delighted by money's velocity and <br>
		i watched time crawl in a three day mystery trip <br>
		      reference ginsberg not woody <br>
		      well not consciously then working man <br>
		      or the peril of visiting a night club <br>
		      after hours, it is still yesterday here <br>
		      midnight sweden -  <br>
		      excuse me as i walk into a dream... <br>
		      export world what is space to astronaut; <br>
		      actually i was on the floor, it's what <br>
		      the spaniards call the english flat: piso <br>
		      collusion insurance property maybe some <br>
		      mishap in oklahoma trembled in tornado <br>
		      who are they? right there in the nearness? <br>
		      some woman, was it her own or a stolen child... <br>
		      infancy without manners pressed up against eye <br>
		      was it olivier that said all the actor is saying <br>
		     is look at me look at me look me look at me look at me <br>
		      of course later i thought of the film look away <br>
		      how many scripts have i memorized by moonlighting... <br>
		      of course i thought of my excursion to washington <br>
		      reference dc not seattle <br>
		      where i never figured out the name of the ugly kid <br>
		      drooling like an old italian man over spaghetti <br>
		      she said it with such an accent that it haunted me <br>
		      alike the woman on the west side telling me she <br>
		      was odetta where my ears perked up baffled <br>
		      as if the thread of logic vanished like virginity <br>
		      on prom night, my mind translated it as 'ol dead... <br>
		      obviously the conversation went no further <br>
		      why would someone say their name is ol dead...well, <br>
		      it was years before i understood there was such an <br>
		      odetta name  but in the poem the national debt <br>
		      increased and in the dream there was a drag race <br>
		      possibly the same woman driving while eating kentucky <br>
		      fried chicken <br>
		      needless to say i was freaked out <br>
		      i waited to write it thinking it would sound like <br>
		      'man who bit orange county police officer dies <br>
		      in custody after arrest'... <br>
		      but finally put pen to paper given the nature of my profession <br>
		      although i worry that certain forces and ford motor <br>
		      conspired or are conspiring against focus <br>
		      yes, i know, you too feel out of focus, blurred by distractions <br>
		      these lines will not help and what is coming might make it worse <br>
		      ahem, across the proverbial pond they are building <br>
		      outdoor classrooms, where exactly you may ask? <br>
		      cockermouth. <br>
		      the same place where all saints teachers hailed an error <br>
		      as the right answer <br>
		      benedict sixteen now has an actual coworker in heaven <br>
		      francis was eighty eight and had met the vice president <br>
		      it brought to mind how the queen perished after meeting liz truss <br>
		      that was two days, this was one day, pretty soon we will have it <br>
		      down to hours perhaps minutes...obviously the goal <br>
		      is instant handshake death when certain public figures greet <br>
		      odd makers in vegas are already raising the stakes <br>
		      chino said me and the black just never got along... <br>
		      which brings me to zelda and her block out of nowhere <br>
		      as if thought needed another puzzle. <br>
		      yet i am happy to report my instinct in sierra saw itself <br>
		      justified...live yesterday i caught her rocking <br>
		      that's levesque alike lubeck... <br>
		      towns i want to visit, dishes i don't want to wash <br>
		      cleaning up staple met thumb and the lyric i gifted <br>
		      her came to mind like why give us words away... <br>
		      grace wore a tee that said satan is a lady, <br>
		      there sure was paranormal activity and alien roach
		      ship hatched in the dresser i gave to skirt as <br>
		      a meal table - damn it man, i'm an artist  <br>
		       not an exterminator! <br>
		      dozens so i lost count, thirtyish, thirtysomething! <br>
		      'i was lucky in the order, but i've always been lucky <br>
		      when it comes to killin...' <br>
		      she was playing outside a tattoo shop that night <br>
		      i could only wonder why she wasn't opening for acdc instead <br>
		      maybe it was the crossing hand at her belly... <br>
		      you see taylor wish wanted to be a negress and <br>
		      refused my argentina request once upon a time... <br>
		      the next day...'when it was all over i walked up. <br>
		      we didn't find one of them, not one stinkin' dink body.' <br>
		      three dollars regular, four dollars diesel <br>
		      ian hunter playing central park n west <br>
		      where am i going with this, nowhere <br>
		      merely filling up the note tank, no <br>
		      i didn't expect to speed into prose-poem lands <br>
		      sure sure i should be more concerned with money <br>
		      a deal cable - damn it man, i'm a career <br>
		      not a corner! <br>
		      hell, maybe we are all cornered... <br>
		      myself i postulate the end of the world was 1945 <br>
		      and in my dream i am again in berlin <br>
		      usually it was wondering what to do as the bombs <br>
		      shook the house... <br>
		      this time, i am with my estranged ming blanket <br>
		      but it's an avenue and the woman with me is <br>
		      hiding me under it, <br>
		      i suppose i was trying to escape the entire war <br>
		      and before i was covered i saw the sight i won't <br>
		      be able to forget; because it was in real life <br>
		      technicolor, because i could hear the squadron <br>
		      boots striking each step in a fierce forward motion <br>
		      and it made my heart shake <br>
		      because the tan uniforms adorned with swastikas <br>
		      did not give army but divinity instead <br>
		      because even after i could no longer see them, <br>
		      the image of the fuhrer remained within imagination <br>
		      (he also in that sturmabteilung brownshirt style) <br>
		      SA marschiert, Achtung! Die strade frei! <br>
		      i find their song, it's a video and the match <br>
		      makes me take a deep breath and pause <br>
		      knowing now none of us were able to circumvent <br>
		      the second world war of allies and axis. <br>
		     axis, a word from the fourteenth century <br>
		      indicating a straight line <br>
		      and so ginsberg went back to bed until the landlord <br>
		      won the eviction suit in the courts. <br>
