  <section>
   i get up to usual smoke nicotine, java
cup caffeine.  dream said girl trying
to show me her body. like a dressing
room. i try to explain the blur...
how in my imagination it is the face.
partly by choice yet also by the
mailer fact of being aware of 
one's self after writing 
anything even remotely
worth the while...
how easy it is to become
a puppet for spies...
dylan said he saw his loved
ones turning into puppets...
i tune into past slow train
finding an infidels out take
and record it twice -
neither good yet great in
not having practiced or evev
heard it since years a go go...</p>
				<p>visions watching that film -
one of the houses reminds
me so keenly of a recent
photoshoot i felt uneasy over -
there is a hidden camera 
in the wall...
most likely hidden cameras
in every wall, two skinny
girls ricochet aint no walls,
laws like gender...
bender aunt dream i step
into hallway saying mother...
mother do you think they'll like 
this song oooh ah...
i can't find her and put on
a beret, sit on sofa with 
emilee as she teases me about
my messy hair...i cook in the
messy kitchen, i eat with pepsi
and memory of her...</p>
		<p class="feature-intro"> clean up, concerned over how
expensive basic materials can be
or become...i taxi to shop,
turtle neck girl i look
i look and she looks and we
dance at looking and looking
away until the cantonese 
woman slides up next to me
examining q-tips, she is wearing
a tee that reads most valuable
player, very friendly, at least
for a chinese woman...
i say a few words in my choppy
chinese and wave goodbye -
i think about them both
as i arrive to put away the
haul but more in terms of why
emilee wore a turtle neck
in california and the series
of t-shirts in recent post...</p>

		<p class="feature-intro"> long ago gave up on hoping
to make a friend in this town.
skirt eats fancy trout -
it is raining as the power
line explodes and the lights 
go out - i sigh, but it doesnt
take too long. i guess i;m
gearing up for new songs and
giving my readers a break
from from all the granting
although it is yet foremost
in my mind's worried eye...
i select a title and 
commit changes. <br>

<br>
	<p class="feature-intro">
friday. leaving the
left over steak, i
almond cupcake 
thinking about you
know who...
it takes me four
hours to eat
all the desire...
i view sin takes
a holiday, there
is talk of putin
possibly accepting
a cease fire...
they call him
ironically a war
lord...i dont 
understand the
word unironically.
worse:
I2vrNsOmFLuPBLXJaT9g-1
at jpg or
"FullsizeMugshotHandle"	
super size obituaries 
i log into x formerly 
twitter...
flirt with the idea
of a caleb carr post,
son of lucien said
the beatniks were
not child friendly
and they weren't 
i read alienest and
thought it was all right.
like an overnight stay
in jail. 
penobscot bay pilot
like an answer in
riddle, carolyn
overlock.

i months late
laundry...
someone force me to
write emails and
do laundry...
i dont nkow
waht she meant,
but it is none of
my business...
i simply wait for
her even when she
is right in the middle

miss grant goes to the door,
<img width="66" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostm68/pantheon/main/MGGTTD_240525_134909.gif">	
eight minutes 1940s...
i close-up her hand
on screen place mine
atop and somehow do not
feel weird over it...
these wires love infused
with chaotic emotions i cut,
hang wet sheets randomly
the cat has trout and
then chicken but is ready
for more...
like me with cigarettes...
coffee... 
	sixteen minutes
to five.	</p>	
   
  <p class="feature-intro start">>>> saturday </p>

		<p class="feature-intro">staying up till nearly eleven
at night i hadn't coded a page
in a while...still ongoing with what background
img to match the font...
awake about four, horny and exhausted.
all sorts of hurry and anxious throbbing 
worry wearing me as if i were their clothes
cupcake cloths the coffee...of course i'm 
thinking of her, once upon a time she said
something about anxiety and depression...
i try to go to sleep again at six,
but it is reconversion blues - 
scattered thoughts - a revolving door mind
so i get up again, i want to be nice
to charlotte and sofia yet i don't
want emilee to think i am being too nice -
i repeat the attempt to sleep some more
at eight but it's tuesday's just as bad
so i stormy monday into civil war -
(not the windmills, poetry book title
i thought of while cervantes)
add bread and onion
to left over steak which is somehow
smokehouse delicious...i see the
stack of bodies but i don't feel
as i did with the wet version which
made me feel cheated, besides it's
dunst - this is kdk12 calling kdk1...
i was thrilled to see her and
and the film was pretty thought
provoking...it's one that i 
suspect a lot of people will watch
twice...in a power of the dog trance
i waltz around the early afternoon,
i've got rawhide phil, fill a thought
with that dog obit kabuso,
also a fruit i read; Citrus sphaerocarpa
sit us fears of coppers...
turquoise skies bright with light
porn dark with disasters yet 
in pouring myself away from the
sun and the sex i notice the name
candice demellza...
but i'm supposed to be writing
poetry not clearing 
the minefield of vulgarity
an impossible task in any case-
three thirty, why was i 
playing the suspended scale
in the fourth position alike
the blues version, should we
show them the blues? don't
let that out, these things take 
time. rhyme - devil's interval-
rubbing out the word, still
the word dust gathers...
emilee needs a butch vampire
in her life, but you could
also pick up something from
her esty shop 
Persimmon Hollow...
no wait, she is not estying now,
so ask @fairygoodfriends

  <p class="feature-intro start">>>> sunday </p>

    <p class="feature-intro">awake at five
still dark with dreams of lost homes -
living room italia fifteen
a cousin holds me from the back...	
in a an embrace as i try to reach
the balcony - mother is there
and i tell her well i've never
felt a man so near - when i turn
for a glance i instead awoke -
it may have been lighthearted,
but i think both were illusions,
perhaps even clones - mixing
in to match some memory but
the scenery was nowhere right -
masked foes possibly to join...
i jump back into dreams, 
apartment three k, i am thinking
about how good it feels to be me -
last room down the hall
standing at the door instantly
thinking why am i here...
i hear emilee's voice and 
wiggle out of bed -
don't you have a croissant to 
eat or something...croissant
clutch i suppose her crimson
coach purse is...
demi, the two skinny girls
grateful dead cover starts
in my mind's stereo as i 
turn on the motorola -
music as i picture her...
suddenly recall the 
can't wait video poolside-
pretty bright, yellow top light -
a woman does anything
then the commentizement rings -
i'm too in love to think clearly-
nose colored glasses, lynyrd
that smell - i brew more and
grew ashes - can wait fan
ate air - i suspect soon
i will escape this imposed
simple style that feels so
blatantly intent against
word play poetry, and then
i will have something
wirth reading even if it caint
be translated told.

on looking what reflection fascinating
love...	struggle to dream - two, three,
roger emil crubel at the piper funeral
home, dorothy we are not in kansas -
amanda paints with her puppy -
los angeles london ashley leak
finger in her mouth, i suppose
she would not be surprised...
it's the nature of such acts -
i am surprised to see her in
my dreams as if a tug of war
with grant...emilee again at
bar louie as the rangers
and panthers play overhead -
pink in her nails now 
fav photo of us forever
i imagine myself, i awake to it
feeling only minutes have gone by -
unlike the hours to update 99
and create inkrealm.info/dr -
they both remind me of her -
visiting the hive, how you
behave is how you behave...
chinese fortune cookie
behind a polaroid on her phone -
blurred, i burn as if born
to mourn the distance -
my own distrust dance
how is it still lust?
suddenly it isnt - it ain't
anything except acceptance -
district twenty five...
her friends are pretty -
my prose isnt poetry and
i can't keep track of the
narrative now as the wires
reattach and embrace me
electrified i die and
reanimate myself - salvation
saliva sylvia has done it again
nazi lampshade press lights
but if it were your women
you'd kill every man woman
or teen in town...at the lampshop
the label is numbered two 
nine five - curiosity rises
hungry to eat men like air -
so now my wife even if
not in my life, so now i sense
the extent of my promise...
beyond this ignorant present,
and I feel now
The future in the instant...
i might even understand the
why within i love you still
but you really made me hate you...
I'm the little Jew
Who wrote the Bible
I've seen the nations rise and fall
I've heard their stories, heard them all...			
she runs away and yet remains.
i escape the tug of catfight
war waking too early, i breathe
for three hours mostly her
magic and exhale these meetings
la matadora with seven brew
fizz or sin a moan spice 
red straw blue tipped nails -
adorn the pink...
oh what is that zepellin...think,
At last the arm is straight, 
the hand to the loom
Is this to end or just begin?

(money to bring
his wife and was working 
hard  to make enough washing 
and see if that will
their house) that is this poem...

He arose as dreams vanished. There was 
eros from the baby munchkin cake and
it made for a bit of conflict. No cornflakes,
pasta with 'a reckless moment'...
some "thoughts" were missing
and he downloaded them to play...
and right off the bat he wanted to say;
The purpose of his writing style
was to make new connections, indeed
to make it new. He knew he wanted
to make poetry for her,  yet the 
bullhead pants (wtap) obituary
beverly j boggs dowler wheaton
via philip hickman found him
watering the plants and so he 
settled in to wait upon wit a while.

The slacks were jeans he had
enslaved into the trash with a sensed
low class tracking system...
Now confirmed. 

This lacks the whip of sensation but
he considers nobody would believe
the dead sons appeared in the shut
sugar bowl after he did the dishes
and then mostly disappeared.

Like magic, no, like mayhem...
ahem. enough prelude.

He wrote as love envisioned.

miss grant it's me, there is nothing to worry about

 reinforcement—it's devotion.

too heavy to hold

she argues, i hold her still -

in sickness, health armoured

in death's counterfeit sleep dreams of her

in death after life desires we forever

or as she herself sort of said

i'd be so hot if i were real

-hint perhaps to keep my phantasy

on its toes- hail.

I do not steal, a line, it is blowin' in the wind...
so you didn't, see that film-heard song- or read,
well literature, my theft, is my own time
rhymes for emilee  and yes my cock.

Lucy  has a solution for apathy

—an axe. 

So when she finds her poet

 intent on skipping the tribeca, 

it's off with his film festival. 

Right from the back seat,

axing did she even follow...


Unfortunately, he witnesses 

the deed, the first season of 

pretty little liars...

 Lucy is tried and judged 

criminally stereotyped...

She spends the next seven years 

at the break even rom com farm.

With Elvis to regain emotional stability.

 Upon her release, she nearly had him,

I've played Melanie, why not Emilee...


He even starts to like her tattoo collection. 

Then, life sentence and the podcast 

made him think, has she even read

Spengler... 

he goes steady with Emilee, 

the richest young girl in town....

Lucy attempts to get cast as a Bond 

girl, but settles for Kissinger in Paris -

troubled by dreams and flashbacks of her 

previous seven years as Aria

She envisions lying in bed with 

the severed heads of inky and emilee...


packing for Manhattan, she carefully organizes

the grenades...

The encounter proves too much and she
	  
she writes new curses on the back 
	  
of her cat on a hot tin roof poster

Let his penis wither, 
	  
let his bones crack, 
	  
let him see his legions drown in their own blood...

 Shortly after, inky cant help but write
	  
an interlude lime posset for her... 

Lucy fears he may have chopped up

the strait jacket story -

Carol screams, I want the truth

it's like an engram inside Cruise control. 

But Tom is blackmailed by Suri -

stop meddling with my right hand man... 

A short time later, mission impossible wraps.

What am I doing over here with the workers,
the gooks, the apes, the dogs, 
the errand boys,
the human animals?
Why don’t I come over with the board, 
and drink coca-cola or make it?

One evening, Inky tries to explain it all to Emilee.

It is not a happy affair. Little Red looked too much like Alivia!

In a rage, Lucy reminds everyone it's a party not a funeral -

Still the balcony had everyone thinking it was about money 

 not love,
	  
obviously, he only wants emilee for her finances!
	  
greed pursued by alone in his home 

he confronted L A WOMAN and COME ON LETS GO

with self comparisons - key of A...  

subsequently promising to help lucy work

with the luke warm coca cola...

a half step down from those chords -

	Point against point rebellious, arm 'gainst arm.
Curbing his lavish spirit: and, to conclude,
The victory fell on us...

doors locked some of them holding a knife -
	  
 In the film's ironic finale, the now magically not typecast

"a wall where peaches ripen";
 
no, i can't always get what i want.
yet neither can you,
 
where are my dreams
“i need you” said Skynrd,
named after a high school teacher
here exhausted he is only writing;
for a hint that whispered oh please,
another canto yes they shot Lennon
he thinks of the ballad, crucifixtion,

And yet “fiction,” games him up.

wind up, there must be something wrong.

with that word, latin crucifigere
“there;s only one headline today…”

radio voices, shot to death by hidden assassins,
China returns from the moon,
Mexico elects a woman -
all of this, prelude as he tries to settle into a groove
it's not like it used to be...the desolation;
arrows and he has lost count
of the dead natives.
Come for his head, come to scalp into insanity-
Even playing, phantom marty big iron,
Grave remodels Claro, draw for it,
Texas red clone...I can't even, as they say...
I'm raising Arizona over in a moment-
"weaving an endless sentence"
bookmaker's stake, you know some ammo
keeps on truckin'
pause;
And in further'd, memory 
Olympics bronze silver gold, the nail scars are true
not for history; but for the faith. the belief.
all those fragile leaves, clinging to that tree -
like I believe Russia is no enemy,
Proof at 1945. Well, except for raping the German 
women...There are no women like our women...
Damn the beauty of that gravesite! what is your endgame,
ireland. 
 
alone,  with her picture
or even with, her there.
chained to earth like the vampire dyke.
 
The synonyms don;t always work
in the newly found image;
she wears stars little and shiny,
across her collar,
it is not a wish of death, yet dying ain't we all.
 
Meanwhile, if you live it up you won't live it down,
other tom, i'm still in a wait, She went and took,
Contemporary that California trip
Against my colon and aromas. I get Jealous
Stagnant, even horny; I'm sure she wants to 
say I love you likewise or more...

yet even facing each other:
 
we will be bottled up,
Do you take this woman?  marriage when?
I took this woman three years ago
here an anniversary song, shaking from the lost,
Emilee exact date !
 
since curtain I am not staff - only an individual;
memory, validation for the shoe,
it was this time of the season...
i looked away not thinking not knowing
the truth, the love...
then the interruption, the delay,
how could there be anyone else...
air vanishing, i was dizzy...
 
not even recording for six months.
And all that day, becomes another day:
 
until evening falls and she calls,
cat quick my purr none of it matters 
shell or show only she mattress...
only she married...breathe
everything is fine but i can't use 
them pictures and i can't hear the name
 
which set such distractions;

even the other day, even today, tonight
it's all toxicesque, a jazz too fast to groove
making me wonder if madness
 
has been taking extra vitamins
but sanity needs her, needs that anniversary,
even the contrast and cost...
of it all since it proves a feeling,
like playing crosby i'm through with love
all afternoon weeping while she worked salon.

 
hennessy story my line about her smile,
was no allusion to work poster,
 
i'm not wearing any panties --
well we could, always adopt,
although the pregnant dream was so reel, real,
 
rael innocent even if guilty;
my virgin saint, 
 
i'm exhausted and i ate too much.
too bad it wasn't your pussy,
maybe a bit later, 
don't get me wrong, sex
 
not, with fears, cannibalism,

Although a bite or, mooning nibble upon bare hill
thrill still into a quev'ring
ah yes even to coin new word,
 
che guevara,
bolivia  blur stares at the new world order;

i take five tic tacs.

with a marlboro:
cigarette, ashes move before me,
 
the rainy night knows i am afraid.
The live wire pain sudden and vicious,
soul casino, even if i have placed no bet
well alien probes and satanic spirits trying 
on a talent like suspenders, spies
lift and leave, sometimes i think it's you,
insisting on something perhaps i cannot hear.
here...
Being more than they, 
hey, do you really love the smiths...
 
GE wandered into Chinatown bank.
sorry if i kissed like onion, 
i have a neverending need in red or white,
the fan whirls.
hoping to win the fender,
 
play you a love song,

The girl in dream, I'm sitting here with grin, she was holding a diploma, 

two fans blazing, then put-placing art over it. rain yet tinted with hotness.

I'm sure i dreamt other things, five June listin news calls I say yeah but

still debating it within myself...twenty twenty five seems a long ways 

away, things like that time I went dream apartment hunting with 

Caitlin...No one is yet to explain Ibiza to me...weren't it Max, Erin

oh kneel, is that why the American in Russia saunters into mind?

in any case, reason eight why i can't remember my dreams lately...

pretty sure it was new Manhattan York city - maybe it was even

Emilee, all I think about...all i care about today, said Lucy - 

Elton's barrel full of monkeys(,, Johnny the bossman* )handing

out bananas, I hope she is fine in her jury chair - where was I,

oh yes, despite the fact that dang Adobe went no more draw

or photoshop mix, flashback Serif (does my art really hold such

power that actual corporations shit I mean shift away products...)

I was feeling all right, thinking of the old bag, affectionately marie

anne - wd'ave put you in seven but sometimes when the thought

bomb goes off i can't jugle it all - idea run at arm...maybe someday

not a transition but a song quote you'll see that it's true

there was no greater love than what i had for you...

now then there, i'm with the grin 'cause suri was racing

around the big apple...i;d mentioned here right before

and enjoyed the near synchronicity, hell, i even took

out the Clorox and mop all the way to the living room...

*(that's what waters muddy called winter not the season -)

i'm not certain sure why he's considered a great given

that not really lead player nor an operatic voice,

still hard again is genius in terms of blues -

bliss at the rest of Miss Grant takes Richmond,

I asked my friends about her, but all their lips were tight -

our lips are seal'd. meal again onion rice chicken...

there's something divine about it most likely from

keira posting posing next to emilee...angel necklace

slave ring metallic teal toes...sixteen glass panel

window painted sea green with an anchor sticker

venus symbol above a heart...lean out your window

goldenhair, no i still don't know how i hit that double

triplet sounding ring, don't even think it can be tabbed...

while dancing with the thought that she was actually

right here, i got so shy i'm sure i blushed, i even sort 

of hoped she hadn't read some of the words herein,

why did i let it get so beatnik naked in terms of 

emotion -  cut reaction line, bring out

Lazarus machine for juice zest and sugar...

the future bleeds through -

i didn't get to sleep til after three again,

even had to overcome a sudden migraine as if the

spirit of fifi had visited, she of headaches when 

sexless...awaking near noon to lower back pain

as if someone had tried to fold me into a suitcase...

but maybe it was only the kitchen...at ritual meditation

i felt all right - forty minutes, graduated digestion

chainsmoke -  i felt i could even sing you're not

alone.

this is what distracted me from leaving my humble abode -

(a freewheeling style...fragments, burroughs, 

associative narrative, influenced by her and music, 

obviously even co-written intentionally, dreams when available,

ideogrammatic juxtapositions talkin world war three blues)

i notice now oyster is also a color, greyish white...

the poet was emilee's oyster, taciturn by nature

he however wore hearted sleeves in his writing,,,

merry web

"Middle English oistre, borrowed from Anglo-French oistre, ostre, 
going back to Latin ostrea, ostreum "bivalve mollusk, oyster,"
 borrowed from Greek óstreion, óstreon, of uncertain origin..."

origin...well sure some "critics" want you to be original,
what is new under the sun gunnin at the shade,
go ahead leave your newborn without
learning or notes and it will only
be idiot...a tale told, then heard no more!

the source here is all that happens as it happens -

more or less...keeping in mind that definitons might evolve
beyond our present understandings...

He says, murder, he says, keep it up like this
He says, murder, he says, in that impossible tone...

We all know the Beach Boys couldn't

wait for June - Good Vibrations - 

I can see-feel the why reasons -

Six June seduced me and 

kept me up nearly into dawn -

no relation to the dish washing soap -

Of course, it wasn't the late night,

wasn't the day or date...A not so

simple twist of fate -

Reaching through air, through

space and time to make 

rhymes with her in rhythm's 

rhythm. A rhythm which swayed

into dreams. Dreams...Therein

ourselves asleep dreaming 

a nap, perhaps a sofa, maybe

it was my sofa bed -  retired

from living room and now

serving martin acoustic

and Ibanez electric...

sceptic glances - she is 

undressing yet not nude -

i am drooling in my mind

hopefully not rude - 

deep into her eyes, she is 

looking back at me -

the ronettes shld've been

singing be my baby -

turn my head

secret glances

her sister above my skull

i can't hear her words

septum ring smiles

i was wondering why

she seems fearless of the sun -

emilee has two sisters

these are my sisters...

crumbles the question

we have no dildos

possibly then i explain

it's literature too and 

dramatic effect...

et cetera in terms of 

big pink stun gun

not a recommendation 

something shoots emilee

a bit in the distance perhaps 

to dance - prancing in another

girl moves the blanket covering 

my bones, i look down at her,

at my boner - i don't want to make

the connection, the number you 

have reached is no longer in service,

please check the number and dial again -

i get up and it's only ten in the morning -

more in love than i had been even if

interrupted - i'll buy no dick, albino

winter that stranger sure sounded 

alike the dark side of the moon

track same year - i decide suddenly

during the ritual to set up for 

a new recording - lucky town -

i put it together, key of E

but when I strum along it is 

in F - well, maybe C...

i record two vocals quickly

escaping the deliveries 

i stacked on purpose all during

the calls to cancel my subscription

listin ounce don't throw

and tell the phone company why

i haven't paid the bill, so it all 

dissolves into a density they can't

crawl through as i lettuce myself

lime olive oil turkey sandwich

The record was released nearly immediately...

I wrote that song a few years ago, c major,

f major, g major...I always credit James

Caan as co-writer, but I don't want to explain it -

when i jotted down the notes for actually

recording it - it was f sharp minor,  E major,

C major, A major, Asus2...

but, as it turned out more like f /b flat/ g/ c...

done quickly on a headphone mix which

when heard on laptop speakers made me sick

as the drums held a sort of ten k frequency slpash

- a rinky dinky sound that took a couple of hours

to manage... at that point i couldn't hear what

i was doing...i decided to spectral pan the 

beat and hoped that my instinct (on headphone)

had been right concerning the rest of it - 

of course, being me, right after ritual "meditation"

i went in for a second take, this time in the key of A,

asus, bsus2, e major 6 (i think) which then breaks

into f#m & e but with a flip back note since i liked

the sound - again two vocals but this time used parts

of either take since i did not pronounce sweet as you 

in the first take - i had intended to imitate the 

Andrew Sisters' bugle boy 

you know that growl...

but when i got to it, my main 

concern was simply escaping into myself and this time

the only glitch was guitar volume, but that didn;t take 

so long to settle - yes i listened to the first (released)

version against this new one and even i don't know which

one works better...i called the second one lucky town 9,

estimating the number of rendered tracks since the first -

obviously lime posset ten is only keeping the title

and format, but not going for the intricate poetics...

as they say, just saying or even js

nothing to do with javascript -

in the wee hours i envision fbi agents attempting

to capture...me? well, maybe it was only a movie

memory...

in sleep, i dream of several people on the floor,

pale, seemingly horny...some are masturbating -

two men and several women, perhaps one couple

is having intercourse ---  i don't feel surprised

or even curious, i look at one woman and watch 

her also take to the floor, alone...i think, to touch

herself...there's something of a blur, no distinct

faces or features...i awake and think nothing of

it except until the following evening, a few hours

ago when i felt the scene re-live like an echo

in peripheral imagination myself not excited

only confounded - i sleep again not getting

out of bed and find myself baffled by someone

from the supermarket giving a speech about

the virgin mary - i don't care if it rains or 

freezes as long as i got my plastic jesus -

dashboard of the dream, i noonish get up

almost running from the scene - there's no 

trust there and it wasn't even in my language -

i shampoo my hair with a sudden back pain -

street legal set up to take out the trash - 

imaginary

crash into me both hips pain so severe i sit me down -

breathe and wonder who or what - 

when then order kfc, mostly to facilitate recording

so as to not worry about fixing a meal or dishes - 

1940 a film called he married his wife...

it's entertaining enough and of course the thought

of wife or married makes me think of emilee, although

constantly in my thoughts...






 
3/4 cup sugar:
_______________


yes - i first met suri cruise in LaGuardia

when i lived in blue white bathroom with skankbang girls -

she's on her way to Carnegie Mellon

we wish her all possible success in Pittsburgh

but i notice as i ramble through my thinking into words

that i haven't mentioned emilee too much here -

maybe i am trying to give nine the chance to firm itself

to film its motion picture production in its selected

locations - the powers that be seemed to pick up

and plug into California...myself i cannot say

what the side effects will be, i can say it was 

not my target...volusia
		    
the sheriff called it pretty shocking -

as holly hills took over chief and captain resigned...

mailer told me if you kill a cop in the states 

point blank you are punk -

he didn't mean that in a rocking way -

i certainly don't mean or aim to be a punk - 

but as i pulled the proverbial ring from grenade

vest poem my mind whispered, for Mathilda...

lando, land ho - 

singing songs of shady sisters
and old time liberty
songs of love and songs of death
and songs that set men free

in any case, it may be that i was overwhelmed 

by something she said "a metaphor"

(i want my hair to go up in flames
for the one i love 
to paradoxically be ignited and extinguished
only by their touch
to burn and burn
and have them catch fire beneath me)

"lust and longing" she may be late

for i long ago fell into the burning  fire

down down down as in the song the flames 

went higher...yet what a nearly perfect poem.

perhaps writing here today not wanting

to throw my hat in the ring -

yes let that be the verse of the day tonight.

it is no easy job to work a song,

i didn't mean to make it sound 

like it was - i remember in chronicles

Dylan "talked" about Man in the Long Black

order of the words as if they had been

set that way before they were wroted -

theirs not his as he is not

Lucky Town is one of the few of mine

try to move in - pay for it - pain for  it...

trying to not football myself into dreams -

do you hear voices, i'll pay you back -

don't we all - no idea who might be talking -

everybody's talking, way past midnight

cowboys, i'm walking here -

wonder if i'm being too aggressive

in my own fan tah sea -

swimming into dreams with the 

day starting, i find myself dreaming

of keira, she had been on my mind

yet i wasn't sure why as i wasn't certain

about the dreams - vague conversations,

alike sitting around speaking without

trying for a keeping...in the mid morning,

i awake to the sound of a foreign

tongue, is it a las tres, or is it ala trez

third tine of an antler's beam

perhaps allah tress, akbar - but allah

is also a woman's name in the cyrilic -

i cycle through these thoughts feeling

still keira and missing emilee -

still, i don't want to crowd her - 

then and there or here now where

readers might decode it as repetition - 

i can't help it, as she says it

how you feel is how you feel about it,

paraphrase...yes i could be fiction,

make something up to entertain

but why should i? do i have to prove

anything - no. i daydream, i have a 

meltdown, what if she wants me to cut

my hair, can i really give up pepsi to

please her coca cola preference, isn't it

bad enough serving skirt...a whole woman

would be even more work - - - i get nervous

i go right up to the grounds of depression,

what am i thinking - i feel like crying -

all of it together is overwhelming -

smoke, to smoke more that is what i 

need, but not these, no cough cough -

i carve out a plan -  i call a taxi

to the store still in fear of the previous

experiences while sauntering - 

virgin olive oil, rice, friskies, and

a hundred and twenty cigarettes

no make that a hundred and sixty -

women in tight white dresses glide

by on their way to atm -

i decide to tip the cashier that

said hey instead of the sour faced

one that has merged with the register

and has become more machine than human -

back home, in minutes, but some ghostly

hamstring hounds my left leg, i sit in the

baby jesus tub letting the heat and pain

disperse...who is the disaster, your guess

i have an extra slice of bread -

I see the word count nearing fifteen hundred -

as nine skips ten into eleven,

free hornet eq plug in i think i miss

but then the email arrives with receipt -

in my dream, ironic humour, being only

a scene wherein i seen a picture of emilee

with a flashing triangle on the lower left corner-

earlier someone showing me a basketball

saying it is inspired by an orange -

meanwhile in the fridge

paramount rotting, i notice later...

i get up already late in the afternoon -

the room humid, my skin icky...

and my emotions getting a talking to...

look dear feelings, you love her obviously

but don't stress worry over a sensation

that is beyond your control - could be

foes doing those double speak lies -

could be they may even be trying to 

get her to see you as her enemy -

worst case scenario jealousy

marry me too or i will cc rider

dreams fading under the  tragedy

elvis concert starts...

i take up the job to remake the 

wordstar index html using

sea harvest, newsy css, and video -

it had been for a new artistic idea

page, but i liked it too much

details going into nearly nine 

in the evening - i make pasta

watch obsession otherwise

known as the hidden room - 

the puppy reminds me of bijoux -

so at this point too much for a short 

story, about a novella, but in 

continuation, a novel if edited...

I've used the word love sixty two 

times, it seems both too much

and not enough.

welcome to annexia sign

how do we know you are really a writer,

write something - yes, write something -

i turn to face my dreams, but there's a

man hammering through the standing walls,

taking my mind into curves i cannot turn...

making my body feel as if outside

and under sun i get up like a white

moon through grey clouds - late in 

the after nobody noon, soon a 

cigarette, some more coffee...

how many times have i done this -

vision of the sight before the clatter

noise claimed imagination -

yes, i was dream dream dreaming

but not alone as i felt myself with

emilee...not that i could see her yet

by my side...a spiritual irony, i suppose -

then i'm facing both keira and ashley -

missing london, have i become england...		    

as if someone reading had merged

words into a raid - or the dark crystal

thra by taking down the skeksis -

welcome to annexia,

yes, welcome to annexia...

yet presently my personal hero's

journey only involves proving to

emilee that i'm faithfully waiting

even asleep, yet in the dream

as if entering a surreal circus

i race with one of these women

through a rising and lowering

series of steps, steps of silk -

I've already gone the distance

we celebrate now thumb sized

the ant's a centaur in his dragon 

kingdom - i can't imagine what

it meant, dream not canto line -

from gulliver's reverie i get 

up a coughy irritation throat

i can't tell if it;s ive fang as it had been

similar once upon a time

or if i'm still haunted by the

crown choker actually

called queen necklace...

emilee are you -

emilee is it -

nine in the morning

i look at the index code

website update

play a bit brew smoke

calm neck - 

and return to no 

dream for banging. 

i turn to face my cat

further apology, but he 

seems to understand.

i turn to face my self

finding only love's desire

____________________________		    

thirteen June an hour after

going to sleep i dream of 

hearing some disturbance

beyond my room...

there's money in there -

the words slow and viciously

excited ring in my ear -

a crowd in living room

someone tells me that

other people had broken in -

i look at the yet how door

not even thinking of the locks

on the adjacent gate -

it is twisted, carved in at 

the bolt mechanism -

a woman approaches

I know you

I say from an office

job I never had -

realizing I am not fully

dressed i go to my clothing

room for ready to wear 

but there is a man there

moving things around

- the cat is there as well-

nobody can touch these

things, i have a very precise

system - he pulls out a cd

and puts it into a player

that i do not have -

I say that stereo

has no speakers -

no hay banda, yet a sort 

of jazz blazes through

I look at a statue that

I also do not have - 

it's faith and she's kissing

some boy, in front of them

another statue and it's 

tilly and she's saying I've

never done this, also 

becoming intimate -

someone darts out

from beside me

it's my cousin,

reportedly homosexual

but I've not seen proof -

he grabs and pulls my

wrist, i wriggle away -

writing now recall smacking

him with a belt -

well, we were kids,

imagine giving up a medical

career to suck dick or

take it up the ass -

surely it would kill Adolfo

his father one of my uncles

retro alpha male military 

personality never served

still freeloading on salute

alone, i suppose -

i'm still a kid, how did 

life get so serious -
 
i walk the few steps

of the inner hallway

back to main living room

where they are replacing

furniture, it looks nice

but what does it all mean...

as i ponder the question,

i get up half thankful that

it was a dream and half 

wondering what emilee

might be doing - i suspect

she's with Alivia or perhaps

worried over her little sister -

prayed to the lord for 

a loving mother or blonde

hair...has the latter,,,

letter someone urging me

to write this all down - 

and i agree but I've had this

sort of scene before except

without faith or tilly -

and certainly without

daydreaming that emilee

is giving me head - 

you married a whore!

a dirty little whore!

diseased whore!

whoa, for all i know she

is a virgin - 

people will talk, libel

slander et cetera - 

me i'm happy

that usually the

writing occupation

ain't sexualized...

one simply sits

there type tap type tap

nothing sexy about it -

unlike say music

or painting which 

indeed might be pretty sensual...

abortion pill nine to zero

reform bill in Argentina approved -

i look at the news to see if there

are other reasons why sleep interrupted,

buzzsprout deleted podcast

actually a stones cover...

they sure give a lot of warnings -

gloria's souls craves intimacy...

monika asking if i have seen

her jogging, looking for a nsa

partner...i can only think of beate

hopefully they will release her -

Jayla says it has all led to this...

friend with benefit...

melina loves me loves "us" together

remember, from starbucks -

actually never sat at one...

visited one on the east side
		    
 the time me and mom 

had to pee and it was the only

place i could think of...

alice sends nude pictures

tongue out tattoo on thigh

sigh, zolaxx does not see how

i am single, obviously hasn't 

received the wedding invitation -

anonymous tits out

if my left leg is thanksgiving

and my right leg is xmas

why don't i come between

holidays...

omfg, and christin is 

stepping up her "game" -

there's not a twitch in my cock

over all these messages -

not with emilee in my thoughts -

when they informed mae west

that ten men were at her door,

she said, send one away 

i'm feeling a bit tired...

i'm not weary, yet the only

message i want is from ms grant -
	  
let's see then, ah yes, return

to sleep, to dream other dreams.

dateline new Zealand, when my astrologer suggested,

(with a hint of enthusiasm) that I should go outside,

I never expected to find myself on the other side of the

world...Is it actually legal for a teenage girl to deliver 

pizza on the heels of the cutiekim delivery vulgarity?

So, I'm dream walking with the astrologer but it is

so calming and peaceful that there is really nothing to report,

or how do you translate a sigh...

i dream of other girls, but it is as if emilee has allowed me,

perhaps for the sake of avoiding the label of being possessive,

to see some other faces...it is all pretty quick and very much

platonic - the only one that was different was dreaming

of Havana topless - actually posted a see through 

Instagram post captioned something alike it made 

me feel euphoric...well before euphoria home box

officed...she was walking down the street, but

like gif not irl therein a superimposed man also

topless appears to be snatching he chain that 

is yet attached to her neck - 

it leads to an argument, someone accusing 

me of imitating lennon...in the dream i start

singing instant karma with a horrible tone 

as if i am being squeezed...so my holiday 

is not complete...if a man rides in an elevator

with Shirley Horn, he should not ever have to sound like

that -  horny cats in heat make more melodious

lines...in another dream i speak to sir Mick or 

rather listen quietly while he makes a recommendation -

middle of the night film, as if Kim Novak is introducing

the age of aquarius...but it also a film that makes

anyone feel they were born in the wrong time and place -

a silent frenzy, which has obviously only gotten 

more drastic and more silent with each passing decade...

i sign up to cosmos,so - however haunted by 

the ello.co fiasco - so, co, you see it rhymes...

hopefully it will work out...

rex Harrison and carole landis did not work out -

i watch behind  green lights,

almost witty yet learning of her unaliving herself

makes me wonder, her family insists rex

had a hand in it and that she was extremely

happy right before even planning her travel

overseas for a film production...

of course, i have nothing to say on the subject,

except it is queer that he was the last person

with her and the one to "find" her telling the 

maid downstairs of the death upstairs before

climbing up the steps...

in any case, he made a few films about spirits -

i suppose to claim a lyric was given to me

by lennon would sound unusual 

yet i stand by "easter" and I've heard

jerry Garcia say matter of factly that

ancient verses of songs floated into

his mind while standing there strumming -

this doesn't mean he is pretending to be

Elizabeth cotton, it simply happened -

he wasn't in command of those spirits

and my awful rendition in dream was

the sarcasm in me reminding whoever

that i am not in the practice of summoning

inspiration as if making a phone call or

posing as any of the greats that have influenced

my way of making music -  et cetera..

you're not my type, typo in left ear -

Havana is the only muse i feel i have 

never been with -

i wake up each day of these two dream

scenes reaching for emilee -

I'm pouring sugar into the milk and coffee,

asking myself when did I sign up for cock acupuncture?

Suddenly, envision Lucy Hale with a voodoo doll

in my likeness - poking the pins into the plastic penis -


I make my way into Instagram hoping for truce

but instead I find that I have missed her birthday...


My defense turns into, yes it was attraction and

yes it is admiration but some of that was feeding

off my love for Emilee Grant...It would not be fair

to you, nearly a movie star! To be a runner up...

No, no - let me finish getting you out of this 

typecasting and then we can continue this

conversation, don't hurt me, I'm a real live

fan...Even if I wroted an opera, I would not

call the monologue songs arias, let's be

friends. 


It's no use, she has a one-way mind

to bend mine into her way of thinking -

You weren't thinking about Emilee

when I got you so hard it hurt, were you?


Lookit that was months ago

 I was still trying to - I didn't understand

everything the way I do now, please be happy

for me...


all right but i'm keeping the doll so if you

break your promise to be my friend

there'll be no hesitation on my part

to put the pins back in even deeper...
