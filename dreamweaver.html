   <h1>dreamweaver three</h1>
        <p><b>
         hmm...14 July 2025.<br>
		i dedicated June to not much at all -<br>
		it felt as if i had wroted a novel<br>
		instead of dream notes...i kept<br>
		wondering over the puzzle of the<br>
		last penned dream herein...it <br>
		was too vivid, maybe too much...<br>
		i only knew that i had to end<br>
		the notes there in order to <br>
		start over...it was an estimated<br>
		three hundred pages if double spaced -<br>
		well, i've put those away and here<br>
		goes...monday, daria called her<br>
		puppy her soulmate...i felt in <br>
		a daze...on the fifth of july,<br>
		i happend to see a picture of<br>
		two friends, children...i kept <br>
		wishing i hadnt seen it, but<br>
		even as cut off as i am from <br>
		most folks and i suppose even <br>
		some of my own emotions, that<br>
		scene really got to me...<br>
		i was in the middle of writing<br>
		some new songs and wrote four<br>
		verses...the fourth was left out<br>
		when it came to recording - <br>
		it took a couple of days to settle <br>
		into it...when i finally escaped<br>
		noisy distractions, the sudden phone<br>
		calls insisting on either hanging up or<br>
		pointless trivia, the strange hound<br>
		seemingly in search of boy-vagina,<br>
		and an insane argument about the beach...<br>
		(what else could it be except madness when<br>
		i have no inclination or desire to sit in the sun)<br>
		oh yes and the bizarre 'no input' mystery<br>
		which i suppose is all part of the process, like<br>
		pound might say...<br>indeed, when i finally escaped<br>
		nothing mattered but the work at hand...i called<br>
		it 'the fifth of july' and put it out for release<br>
		with these lyrics;<br>
		<BR>
		I KNEW LILA WAS DEAD <br>
		- HOPED ELOISE WOULD SURVIVE;<br>
		SHE LOVED HER PUPPY DOG, <br>
		SHE HADNT EVER BEEN WED.<br>
<br>
		A HOUSE DANCED <br>
		ON A RIVER'S SONG AS IT PLAYED<br>
		LONE STAR STATE OF TEXAS <br>
		YEAH SOMEHOW STAYED...<br>
<br>
		I COULDNT TELL HANNAH AND REBECCA APART<br>
		- THEY WERE TWINS LIKE<br>
		FLOWERS IN A FIELD'S GARDEN <br>
		- IT'D BEEN THAT WAY RIGHT FROM THE START<br>
		<br>
		A HOUSE DANCED<br>
		UPON A RIVER <br>
		(A RIVER'S SONG AS IT PLAYED)<br>
		LONE STAR STATE OF TEXAS<br>
		WE SOMEHOW STAYED...<br>
		<BR>
		LITTLE BLAIR COULDNT UNDERSTAND <br>
		- SHE WEPT SHE CRIED;<br>
		LITTLE BROOKE COVERED HER <br>
		SAYING COME ON GIRL HOLD MY HAND<br>
		
		<br>
		A HOUSE DANCED <br>
		UPON A RIVER'S SONG AS IT PLAYED<br>
		LONE STAR STATE OF TEXAS<br>
		WE SOMEHOW STAYED...<br>
		<BR>
		
		A HOUSE DANCED <br>
		UPON A RIVER <br>
		(A RIVER'S SONG AS IT PLAYED)<br>
		LONE STAR STATE OF TEXAS <br>
		WE SOMEHOW STAYED...<br>
		<BR>         
		      
		      i'd put placed all four verses on vsco from <br>
		handwritten notes photographed along with the chords<br>
		which remained the same...save for an added note<br>
                musical note. <br>
		as i glance through recollections, wondering why julia<br>
		mecey and joey king enjoy love island, wondering if<br>
		charles bukowski actually dropped a man at the race track<br>
		as in the italic section of factum or even why sylvia<br>
		plath's ghost doesnt haunt the hell out of matt haig...<br>
		i remember that night, the fourth of july...<br>
		i dreamt something like a bridge or a dam where the water<br>
		was red, crimson, but in that nearly dried blood brown color<br>
		and i couldn't see where i was but i saw a man holding a shotgun<br>
		and he did not move or speak, the motionless image against the <br>
		waves were etched in my mind the following day...i thought it<br>
		was about a guitar that had been slow to arrive and that<br>
		possibly it had suffered in transit yet by the time i went to<br>
		sleep again it felt revealed...well, decyphered...neither spirit<br>
		nor worry could save these lives from the devastation waltz<br>
		winding its way in what they call flash flood alley...<br>
		i was certain it was william s burroughs, a man who knew<br>
		about loss in an intimate way...aside from the wife, his only<br>
		son had perished and even in the afterlife i suppose some<br>
		emotions keep, all you can do is stand there and bear witness<br>
		i learned also that gabrielle's mother and my own share<br>
		a birthdate as it were...<br>
		i don't want to write anymore about these things as in<br> 
		typing i might not reflect how much i felt and much less<br>
		how it all still hurts and will continue to hurt so many...<br>
		so i re-order that guitar and continue to wait...<br>
		i have a few dreams to jot, but those will be done<br>
		at some other point in time when i can turn my minimalist<br>
		writing into an even more concise style so as to not end<br>
		up with a book-length manuscript that might only serve<br>
		self-references...<br>
		
		<br>
		<br>
		16 july 2025<br>
		<br>
		i consider yesterday notable even if i don't<br>
		fully examine it here...<br>
		learning another side of the camp story...<br>
		what was her name, hayden...well she spoke<br>
		kinda like how i speak...<br>
		the second axe was shipped on the 11th<br>
		and arrived on the 15th<br>
		it felt as if my writing had manifested it...<br>
		reminds me of the telecaster except it <br>
		has a decided rock and roll tone<br>
		(no single coil pick ups)<br>
		i decorated it while listening to mustang sally<br>
		for a minute, everything else took a back seat<br>
		meaning it was thrilling...<br>
		i'm thinking now of a dream i had in may<br>
		i'd been with lotta in my old apartment<br>
		she kissed me and it was magical<br>
		we lay there talking about what the next meal<br>
		should be when a man with gun started shooting<br>
		at me and i ran into another room<br>
		there is a bookend dream to this scene which<br>
		i will jot later...<br>
		she's watching the summer i turned pretty<br>
		which i looked at but found revolting<br>
		i'm wearing a snake ring on my middle finger<br>
		instead of my stainless steel spoon since<br>
		some sort of rust invaded it...<br>
		anyway i awoke with a racing heart and <br>
		the realization of how much she means to me<br>
		hmm...when i said not much in june i meant movies too<br>
		although i did watch most of the secret life <br>
		of the american teenager<br>
		well, this was more than i intended to note...<br>
		let's leave it at that - for now -<br>
		here are two outtakes of the song i mentioned<br>
		i had the intent to adjust my release for one of<br>
		these but i couldn't figure out how to do that<br>
		and i am aware that this sort of takes the<br>
		expectation away from the single but i want <br>
		to share these as a way of saying it is<br>
		not about streams or whatever, it is what it is.<br>

		      correction, the mustang only sounded like
		      that through the boss amp...at the fender,
		      it was much nicer...yes i was fender-reluctant,
		      but since i don't much use pedals, the champ
		      amp was only logical...as for the guitar,
		      i kept hearing a line from blind willie mctell
		      when i would go window shopping for axes until
		      finally i didn't want to be haunted by it...
		      it is a step up from the ancient mustang i 
		      had which hardly ever stayed in tune but it
		      is not for big hands, even mine feel it to 
		      be a task going up the fret as if i had to
		      abbreviate my fingers which is the exact 
		      opposite of the jackson wherein my hands
		      sense and appropiate the space...
		      at least i feel a sort of bulgari vibe with
		      my new ring...still, all this goes against
		      my attempt at brevity and i have yet to
		      jot the dream note...hmm, notes..
		      connie francis died and her song had
		      recently become a hit again...even a parody
		      emerged, "you can touch my pussy..." which might
		      have been the cause of her demise...but
		      many several poets also passed away
		      and i had the evil urge to make a list
		      of all the writers that had perished
		      after 'the tortured poets depart-ment'
		      hmm...but what really worries me is
		      the grammar when gender is made illogical-
		      andrea is called 'they' instead of she -
		      here is quote/example:
		      "Their father, Mark, worked for a post office
		      and their mother, Shirley, was a secretary at a 
		      technical college. They have one sister, Laura."
		      this plural form makes language more of a virus
		      than it needs to be, indeed and why? 
		      where was i...ah yeah, i find 
		      lately that i go to sleep only to awake 
		      an hour or so later simply to wander
		      around in confusion...that was the case
		      last night, but first the bookend thing;
		      i had walked into a shop with julia and
		      told her to get something to drink, there
		      were only cans of coors in the fridge...
		      we walked out and there and then several
		      men harassed us, one of them with a stick
		      that knocked the hat off my head...it had
		      been a goodly time until then...weeks later
		      i learned that he had lost her red baseball cap -
		      cut to yesterady, i'm in the bath and the bath
		      is overflowing, i am trying without luck to 
		      shut off the water as somehow there are more
		      knobs than i care to count, i say the words
		      julia help but as i do i find the right knob
		      then we are on a bed where a cat climbs up,
		      i remark that it is not skirt and i think of
		      hedwig who it resembles but as a kitten - 
		      the cat speaks and i wonder if we have all gone
		      crazy...i awake and can't get back to sleep until
		      half a pack of cigarettes and coffee argue with
		      melatonin...i kept seeing romy mars although i 
		      only 'met' her at some far away chanel thing...
		      i like her especially since she positively proves
		      my point that sofia was and is pretty...the only 
		      thing is it makes mayhem of my fantasy life...
		      love her ego song - so catchy...
		      she had a bad scene at some hotel, in my dream
		      which i thought was about michael madsen, another
		      poet, i was in the elevator trying to get to the
		      twenty ninth floor - there was no 29 button,
		      someone pressed all the buttons and i got out
		      on seventeen determined to navigate the stairs -
		      1920s elegance surrounded me, someone with a 
		      glass case of coins, collectables, and aritfacts
		      was set up like a cigarette girl might be and 
		      i stopped for a glance there and then noticing 
		      a man seemingly having a heart attack nearby,
		      i kept walking after thinking about it all for 
		      a minute - as i contemplate it now it was like
		      the waldorf astoria...a minute ago having a grand
		      re-birth...i'd been there once upon a late night
		      frenzy...but i don't remember any stairs...not even 
		      much walking as yellow cabs did the work...miss
		      morin was at the chelsea hotel, i took a peek at 
		      how upscale 23rd street is now...i think it's where i 
		      bought that other mustang...i think it's still
		      there unlike music row on 48th...anyway, yes poets
		      are supposed to die like everyone else while
		      a few songs and verses live on but is it time
		      to advocate for protection of the scribes...
		      well, i dunno, but if someone whats to protect
		      me - please do but get Daria safe before that...

		      3 aug 
		      <br>
		      <br>
		      not sure what to call this...an update? an
		      explanation...well whatever it is, the thing
		      is that last month i decided to make these
		      notes wait until the song was released, which
		      i expected to be a matter of days or a week...
		      there are several many dreams on the backlog...
		      but maybe this will help me make it all more
		      concise...still, i don't want anyone thinking
		      that i have been putting the dreamweaver page
		      on the backburner...on the offchance that
		      new visitors arrive or that i have upset
		      followers, i am put-placing the earlier notes
		      back in some sort of extra html box...meanwhile,
		      i still expect the track to be released any minute
		      now...i am reading charlotte bronte's villete,
		      i had more of a party than i expected with charles
		      bukowski's hollywood...nearly as lavish as pulp,
		      now i am in the middle of a cheesy slasher ride
		      called graduation day - this after viewing
		      red sun and wondering who would find the sword
		      left hanging there on the train wires...i think
		      i have entered into the veritas guitar giveaway
		      and i will be beside myself if i happen to win -
		      hmm i was thinking about love letters from a portuguese
		      nun as i wondered why it had such an impact...i couldn't
		      figure it out, as i looked at it again everyone seemed
		      to differ from my recollection but i saw why or partly
		      why kia attracted me...there is a similarity between
		      her and susan hemingway...it was then that robyn disappeared
		      and i viewed ballerina which i felt was too much into
		      developing the backstory and training only to be clumsy
		      but it came through in the end with some help from
		      keanu and a flamethrower...being maria was extremely
		      hard to get through, as i think highly of LTIP yet
		      this never gives you a way to care for ms schneider - 
		      the element of spoiled brat never leaves...despite
		      the stories she and brando remained friends although
		      it is true that the same cannot be said for bertolucci -
		      you see there is no way to win, obviously i can't dismiss
		      a woman's suffering but i cannot badmouth bertolucci as
		      the only director that ever mailed me directly as if 
		      i were on his level...well, some situations have no
		      distinct resolution...let's see i also took a look at
		      meghan 2.0 but the wonder of the first has worn off in 
		      this sequel - didn't they see the fabulous potential
		      of the opening story with an ai model gone beserk...
		      dude, that was the movie and then end it with the 
		      promise of meghan being re-built for a third film...well,
		      it didnt leave a bad taste yet mostly that's the way i
		      saw it...like they threw everything at the audience hoping
		      something would stick...finally, cold sweat was all right
		      but here too they purposely posed the little girl to 
		      give men upskirt panty shots...no reason at all unless there 
		      is something about bastille day they haven't told me...
		      yeah, dream notes will return when the song is out.
