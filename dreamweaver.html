jueves thursday donnerstag
                </p><font color="green">

i get up to usual smoke nicotine, java
cup caffeine. dream said girl trying
to show me her body. like a dressing
room. i try to explain the blur...
how in my imagination it is the face.
partly by choice yet also by the
mailer fact of being aware of 
one's self after writing 
anything even remotely
worth the while...
how easy it is to become
a puppet for spies...
dylan said he saw his loved
ones turning into puppets...
i tune into past slow train
finding an infidels out take
and record it twice -
neither good yet great in
not having practiced or evev
heard it since years a go go...
visions watching that film -
one of the houses reminds
me so keenly of a recent
photoshoot i felt uneasy over -
there is a hidden camera 
in the wall...
most likely hidden cameras
in every wall, two skinny
girls ricochet aint no walls,
laws like gender...
bender aunt dream i step
into hallway saying mother...
mother do you think they'll like 
this song oooh ah...
i can't find her and put on
a beret, sit on sofa with 
emilee as she teases me about
my messy hair...i cook in the
messy kitchen, i eat with pepsi
and memory of her...
i clean up, concerned over how
expensive basic materials can be
or become...i taxi to shop,
turtle neck girl i look
i look and she looks and we
dance at looking and looking
away until the cantonese 
woman slides up next to me
examining q-tips, she is wearing
a tee that reads most valuable
player, very friendly, at least
for a chinese woman...
i say a few words in my choppy
chinese and wave goodbye -
i think about them both
as i arrive to put away the
haul but more in terms of why
emilee wore a turtle neck
in california and the series
of t-shirts in recent post...
long ago gave up on hoping
to make a friend in this town.
skirt eats fancy trout -
it is raining as the power
line explodes and the lights 
go out - i sigh, but it doesnt
take too long. i guess i;m
gearing up for new songs and
giving my readers a break
from from all the granting
although it is yet foremost
in my mind's worried eye...
i select a title and 
commit changes. 5:18pm
