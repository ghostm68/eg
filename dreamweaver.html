   i get up to usual smoke nicotine, java
cup caffeine.  dream said girl trying
to show me her body. like a dressing
room. i try to explain the blur...
how in my imagination it is the face.
partly by choice yet also by the
mailer fact of being aware of 
one's self after writing 
anything even remotely
worth the while...
how easy it is to become
a puppet for spies...
dylan said he saw his loved
ones turning into puppets...
i tune into past slow train
finding an infidels out take
and record it twice -
neither good yet great in
not having practiced or evev
heard it since years a go go...</p>
				<p>visions watching that film -
one of the houses reminds
me so keenly of a recent
photoshoot i felt uneasy over -
there is a hidden camera 
in the wall...
most likely hidden cameras
in every wall, two skinny
girls ricochet aint no walls,
laws like gender...
bender aunt dream i step
into hallway saying mother...
mother do you think they'll like 
this song oooh ah...
i can't find her and put on
a beret, sit on sofa with 
emilee as she teases me about
my messy hair...i cook in the
messy kitchen, i eat with pepsi
and memory of her...</p>
		<p class="feature-intro"> clean up, concerned over how
expensive basic materials can be
or become...i taxi to shop,
turtle neck girl i look
i look and she looks and we
dance at looking and looking
away until the cantonese 
woman slides up next to me
examining q-tips, she is wearing
a tee that reads most valuable
player, very friendly, at least
for a chinese woman...
i say a few words in my choppy
chinese and wave goodbye -
i think about them both
as i arrive to put away the
haul but more in terms of why
emilee wore a turtle neck
in california and the series
of t-shirts in recent post...</p>

		<p class="feature-intro"> long ago gave up on hoping
to make a friend in this town.
skirt eats fancy trout -
it is raining as the power
line explodes and the lights 
go out - i sigh, but it doesnt
take too long. i guess i;m
gearing up for new songs and
giving my readers a break
from from all the granting
although it is yet foremost
in my mind's worried eye...
i select a title and 
commit changes. <br>

friday. leaving the
left over steak, i
almond cupcake 
thinking about you
know who...
it takes me four
hours to eat
all the desire...
i view sin takes
a holiday, there
is talk of putin
possibly accepting
a cease fire...
they call him
ironically a war
lord...i dont 
understand the
word unironically.

someone force me to

		<p class="feature-intro">staying up till nearly eleven
at night i hadn't coded a page
in a while...still ongoing with what background
img to match the font...
awake about four, horny and exhausted.
all sorts of hurry and anxious throbbing 
worry wearing me as if i were their clothes
cupcake cloths the coffee...of course i'm 
thinking of her, once upon a time she said
something about anxiety and depression...
i try to go to sleep again at six,
but it is reconversion blues - 
scattered thoughts - a revolving door mind
so i get up again, i want to be nice
to charlotte and sofia yet i don't
want emilee to think i am being too nice -
i repeat the attempt to sleep some more
at eight but it's tuesday's just as bad
so i stormy monday into civil war -
(not the windmills, poetry book title
i thought of while cervantes)
add bread and onion
to left over steak which is somehow
smokehouse delicious...i see the
stack of bodies but i don't feel
as i did with the wet version which
made me feel cheated, besides it's
dunst - this is kdk12 calling kdk1...
i was thrilled to see her and
and the film was pretty thought
provoking...it's one that i 
suspect a lot of people will watch
twice...in a power of the dog trance
i waltz around the early afternoon,
i've got rawhide phil, fill a thought
with that dog obit kabuso,
also a fruit i read; Citrus sphaerocarpa
sit us fears of coppers...
turquoise skies bright with light
porn dark with disasters yet 
in pouring myself away from the
sun and the sex i notice the name
candice demellza...
but i'm supposed to be writing
poetry not clearing 
the minefield of vulgarity
an impossible task in any case-
three thirty, why was i 
playing the suspended scale
in the fourth position alike
the blues version, should we
show them the blues? don't
let that out, these things take 
time. rhyme - devil's interval-
rubbing out the word, still
the word dust gathers...
emilee needs a butch vampire
in her life, but you could
also pick up something from
her esty shop 
Persimmon Hollow...
no wait, she is not estying now,
so ask @fairygoodfriends


    <p class="feature-intro">awake at five
still dark with dreams of lost homes -
living room italia fifteen
a cousin holds me from the back...	
in a an embrace as i try to reach
the balcony - mother is there
and i tell her well i've never
felt a man so near - when i turn
for a glance i instead awoke -
it may have been lighthearted,
but i think both were illusions,
perhaps even clones - mixing
in to match some memory but
the scenery was nowhere right -
masked foes possibly to join...
i jump back into dreams, 
apartment three k, i am thinking
about how good it feels to be me -
last room down the hall
standing at the door instantly
thinking why am i here...
i hear emilee's voice and 
wiggle out of bed -
don't you have a croissant to 
eat or something...croissant
clutch i suppose her crimson
coach purse is...
demi, the two skinny girls
grateful dead cover starts
in my mind's stereo as i 
turn on the motorola -
music as i picture her...
suddenly recall the 
can't wait video poolside-
pretty bright, yellow top light -
a woman does anything
then the commentizement rings -
i'm too in love to think clearly-
nose colored glasses, lynyrd
that smell - i brew more and
grew ashes - can wait fan
ate air - i suspect soon
i will escape this imposed
simple style that feels so
blatantly intent against
word play poetry, and then
i will have something
wirth reading even if it caint
be translated told.

i'll stop the world 
and melt with you -
i skip through it
in a few minutes...
of course, she's not
there anyway and i start
thinking what exactly
do i have to be proud
about - the hit the books
so they don't hit you back
gimmick, the sleeping pills
in attack dog snack gimmick,
the pile of dead bodies in

all right mister inky,

LIME POSSET
		
double cream:	
		
(money to bring
his wife and was working 
hard  to make enough washing 
and see if that will
their house) that is this poem...

He arose as dreams vanished. There was 
eros from the baby munchkin cake and
it made for a bit of conflict. No cornflakes,
pasta with 'a reckless moment'...
some "thoughts" were missing
and he downloaded them to play...
and right off the bat he wanted to say;
The purpose of his writing style
was to make new connections, indeed
to make it new. He knew he wanted
to make poetry for her,  yet the 
bullhead pants (wtap) obituary
beverly j boggs dowler wheaton
via philip hickman found him
watering the plants and so he 
settled in to wait upon wit a while.

The slacks were jeans he had
enslaved into the trash with a sensed
low class tracking system...
Now confirmed. 

This lacks the whip of sensation but
he considers nobody would believe
the dead sons appeared in the shut
sugar bowl after he did the dishes
and then mostly disappeared.

Like magic, no, like mayhem...
ahem. enough prelude.

He wrote as love envisioned.

lime juice and zest :

The peddler had certainly spoken the truth 
although he did not know what truth
daughter meant when declared

Your vanity has led you away.
Like masturbation
scrubbing it 
vigorously 

(is that what they think we do...)

The agency informs him;
'cutiekim' first date comment
finds 'raspberrypussy' no cat
how dare they act on 

(is someone out of innuendo?)

Then the race against lies

soap was irresistible

3 drown to call girl

(further into the maze...)

To admit some excitement

at the constructed whore or virgin

either lessens love or heightens it...

Strangle neck / slap ass,

You see how fast it can go down

to no class at all, a lesson in

or as the rolling stones put place it

beautiful you haven't told me

i'm the most beautiful girl in

the world in a couple of days...

severely i say yes, no i have not

but words don't wash off, won't wash away.

suddenly repenting, but yes you are

beautiful even as a child even as a vampire

even as the non-existing "now"...

indeed even as i head to the liquifying

sink to bury the offspring scouring

for a prayer or excuse...

my heart. touched my heart. I wanted to red.

crimson brick wall blood tomato years ago

so the azure blood i saw pour from self

was also in kitchen hmm brown paper bag

i tried to hide it and i guess i did until souls

crawled with a wail in unforeseen future kitchen

this. that door, doors, let my mind be your gentle

stove. clove. make it a clove paper bag. no it;s

not a paperback.  i won't get into the cut gas

narrative, i mean i want her to orgasm 

not gasp. seven snakes naja haje asp...

my left testicle itches -  all this really

happened so i will never make love to her

in any kitchen, unless she requires me

to beautiful pasta green pepper parmesan

eat cheese chat. 


dry biscuit crumb:

as she melts my French tickler minaret
