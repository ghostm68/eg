   i get up to usual smoke nicotine, java
cup caffeine.  dream said girl trying
to show me her body. like a dressing
room. i try to explain the blur...
how in my imagination it is the face.
partly by choice yet also by the
mailer fact of being aware of 
one's self after writing 
anything even remotely
worth the while...
how easy it is to become
a puppet for spies...
dylan said he saw his loved
ones turning into puppets...
i tune into past slow train
finding an infidels out take
and record it twice -
neither good yet great in
not having practiced or evev
heard it since years a go go...</p>
				<p>visions watching that film -
one of the houses reminds
me so keenly of a recent
photoshoot i felt uneasy over -
there is a hidden camera 
in the wall...
most likely hidden cameras
in every wall, two skinny
girls ricochet aint no walls,
laws like gender...
bender aunt dream i step
into hallway saying mother...
mother do you think they'll like 
this song oooh ah...
i can't find her and put on
a beret, sit on sofa with 
emilee as she teases me about
my messy hair...i cook in the
messy kitchen, i eat with pepsi
and memory of her...</p>
		<p class="feature-intro"> clean up, concerned over how
expensive basic materials can be
or become...i taxi to shop,
turtle neck girl i look
i look and she looks and we
dance at looking and looking
away until the cantonese 
woman slides up next to me
examining q-tips, she is wearing
a tee that reads most valuable
player, very friendly, at least
for a chinese woman...
i say a few words in my choppy
chinese and wave goodbye -
i think about them both
as i arrive to put away the
haul but more in terms of why
emilee wore a turtle neck
in california and the series
of t-shirts in recent post...</p>

		<p class="feature-intro"> long ago gave up on hoping
to make a friend in this town.
skirt eats fancy trout -
it is raining as the power
line explodes and the lights 
go out - i sigh, but it doesnt
take too long. i guess i;m
gearing up for new songs and
giving my readers a break
from from all the granting
although it is yet foremost
in my mind's worried eye...
i select a title and 
commit changes. <br>

friday. leaving the
left over steak, i
almond cupcake 
thinking about you
know who...
it takes me four
hours to eat
all the desire...
i view sin takes
a holiday, there
is talk of putin
possibly accepting
a cease fire...
they call him
ironically a war
lord...i dont 
understand the
word unironically.

someone force me to
write emails and
do laundry...

feel weird over it...

		<p class="feature-intro">staying up till nearly eleven
at night i hadn't coded a page
in a while...still ongoing with what background
img to match the font...
awake about four, horny and exhausted.
all sorts of hurry and anxious throbbing 
worry wearing me as if i were their clothes
cupcake cloths the coffee...of course i'm 
thinking of her, once upon a time she said
something about anxiety and depression...
i try to go to sleep again at six,
but it is reconversion blues - 
scattered thoughts - a revolving door mind
so i get up again, i want to be nice
to charlotte and sofia yet i don't
want emilee to think i am being too nice -
i repeat the attempt to sleep some more
at eight but it's tuesday's just as bad
so i stormy monday into civil war -
(not the windmills, poetry book title
i thought of while cervantes)
add bread and onion
to left over steak which is somehow
smokehouse delicious...i see the
stack of bodies but i don't feel
as i did with the wet version which
made me feel cheated, besides it's
dunst - this is kdk12 calling kdk1...
i was thrilled to see her and
and the film was pretty thought
provoking...it's one that i 
suspect a lot of people will watch
twice...in a power of the dog trance
i waltz around the early afternoon,
i've got rawhide phil, fill a thought
with that dog obit kabuso,
also a fruit i read; Citrus sphaerocarpa
sit us fears of coppers...
turquoise skies bright with light
porn dark with disasters yet 
in pouring myself away from the
sun and the sex i notice the name
candice demellza...
but i'm supposed to be writing
poetry not clearing 
the minefield of vulgarity
an impossible task in any case-
three thirty, why was i 
playing the suspended scale
in the fourth position alike
the blues version, should we
show them the blues? don't
let that out, these things take 
time. rhyme - devil's interval-
rubbing out the word, still
the word dust gathers...
emilee needs a butch vampire
in her life, but you could
also pick up something from
her esty shop 
Persimmon Hollow...
no wait, she is not estying now,
so ask @fairygoodfriends

  <p class="feature-intro start">>>> sunday </p>

    <p class="feature-intro">awake at five
still dark with dreams of lost homes -
living room italia fifteen
a cousin holds me from the back...	
in a an embrace as i try to reach
the balcony - mother is there
and i tell her well i've never
felt a man so near - when i turn
for a glance i instead awoke -
it may have been lighthearted,
but i think both were illusions,
perhaps even clones - mixing
in to match some memory but
the scenery was nowhere right -
masked foes possibly to join...
i jump back into dreams, 
apartment three k, i am thinking
about how good it feels to be me -
last room down the hall
standing at the door instantly
thinking why am i here...
i hear emilee's voice and 
wiggle out of bed -
don't you have a croissant to 
eat or something...croissant
clutch i suppose her crimson
coach purse is...
demi, the two skinny girls
grateful dead cover starts
in my mind's stereo as i 
turn on the motorola -
music as i picture her...
suddenly recall the 
can't wait video poolside-
pretty bright, yellow top light -
a woman does anything
then the commentizement rings -
i'm too in love to think clearly-
nose colored glasses, lynyrd
that smell - i brew more and
grew ashes - can wait fan
ate air - i suspect soon
i will escape this imposed
simple style that feels so
blatantly intent against
word play poetry, and then
i will have something
wirth reading even if it caint
be translated told.

pink in her nails now 
fav photo of us forever
i imagine myself, i awake to it
feeling only minutes have gone by -

even high in soft spoken
whisper, would you leave
that movie for me -
i'll stop the world 
and melt with you -
i skip through it
in a few minutes...
of course, she's not
there anyway and i start
thinking what exactly
do i have to be proud
about - the hit the books
so they don't hit you back
gimmick, the sleeping pills
in attack dog snack gimmick,
the pile of dead bodies in
vampire mansion gimmick...
all right mister inky,

(money to bring
his wife and was working 
hard  to make enough washing 
and see if that will
their house) that is this poem...

He arose as dreams vanished. There was 
eros from the baby munchkin cake and
it made for a bit of conflict. No cornflakes,
pasta with 'a reckless moment'...
some "thoughts" were missing
and he downloaded them to play...
and right off the bat he wanted to say;
The purpose of his writing style
was to make new connections, indeed
to make it new. He knew he wanted
to make poetry for her,  yet the 
bullhead pants (wtap) obituary
beverly j boggs dowler wheaton
via philip hickman found him
watering the plants and so he 
settled in to wait upon wit a while.

The slacks were jeans he had
enslaved into the trash with a sensed
low class tracking system...
Now confirmed. 

This lacks the whip of sensation but

She spends the next seven years 

at the break even rom com farm.

With Elvis to regain emotional stability.

 Upon her release, she nearly had him,

I've played Melanie, why not Emilee...


He even starts to like her tattoo collection. 

Then, life sentence and the podcast 

made him think, has she even read

Spengler... 

he goes steady with Emilee, 

the richest young girl in town....

Lucy attempts to get cast as a Bond 

girl, but settles for Kissinger in Paris -

troubled by dreams and flashbacks of her 

previous seven years as Aria

She envisions lying in bed with 

the severed heads of inky and emilee...


packing for Manhattan, she carefully organizes

the grenades...

The encounter proves too much and she
	  
she writes new curses on the back 
	  
of her cat on a hot tin roof poster

Let his penis wither, 
	  
let his bones crack, 
	  
let him see his legions drown in their own blood...

 Shortly after, inky cant help but write
	  
an interlude lime posset for her... 

Lucy fears he may have chopped up

the strait jacket story -

Carol screams, I want the truth

it's like an engram inside Cruise control. 

But Tom is blackmailed by Suri -

stop meddling with my right hand man... 

A short time later, mission impossible wraps.

What am I doing over here with the workers,
the gooks, the apes, the dogs, 
the errand boys,
the human animals?
Why don’t I come over with the board, 
and drink coca-cola or make it?

 not love,
	  
obviously, he only wants emilee for her finances!
	  
greed pursued by alone in his home 

he confronted L A WOMAN and COME ON LETS GO

subsequently promising to help lucy work

a half step down from those chords -

Curbing his lavish spirit: and, to conclude,
The victory fell on us...

i feel i should have listened

of becoming a grown up
the nostalgia of a childhood
home - what was it sunlight

i realize this writing is 
a chaotic storm typed not
for any type but trembling
with and without her -


what is it that she doesn't mind
sharing - peace usually myself

how is everything so right

The sun's hum id bounces into the city, 
seeps through
windows that need caulk or duct tape...
Technical issues
with my axilla. I find new Cali pictures
yet only two
and they are
	cropped as if hiding her face -  

Why do you hide your love...
Waiting around all day,
I even came off as silly to myself.
So much so, that
I hesitated today to even hold the cell phone...

I had got up at eight thirty, 
despite falling into slumber
after three -  

Dreaming there is a man next to her,
		    
but I can only see

the corner of his body, the axilla...
		    
Waking to feel it was myself

only trying to figure out
		    
the itchy heat rash - 

Heatwave, nice song not so much 
		    
in terns of weather -

what weather event are you - 
		    
Thunder figures out finally

who the baby munchkin is,
		    
Isabella Griffin - but also

holding five photographs of my beloved -

I forget

the word for the square Italian slice...
		    
Sicilian -

naked city, clan attacks herself and Keira and even

Kris or Cris btw Carli is actually spelled Carly - 

i tell them i'm nobody, i'm nothing...but they seem

to know better...Perhaps it was the email from Canada

saying i was married got leaked...
		    
Bella goes for the hail

mary pass but I slip and slide until 
		    
bribing Daria with Pokeman cards gets me 
		    
to my bride - Note not Syracuse. Gaglione...

Someone tell me what the hell happened between her

and Kyle...Key ignition reverie, I am inside her at last

but dying family members drowsy me until i turn riot -

taking her possessed by a need to read Fyodor's Demons-

Of course, not to be outdone she oils me on Nordic Ware

pan adjusting her strap on and slapping me into submission,

how do you like my big pink stun gun...it sounds nothing like

the band...Virgil Kane is the name and I served on the Danville

train till Stoneman's cavalry came and tore up the tracks again...

Alexandra buys a guinea pig near Baltimore to rub it in -

 
Anya bets on the twenty year plan, PANTA RAI -

I hint at my Bonanno contact, put that Buchanan in line,

In any case, I procrastinate - when I finally get to the

four chickens and a coke...

I had thought of Hopper and Ganz and the subsequent ambulance...

Dennis, Bruno, for the readers in the cheap seats....

 I can't apologize for being drowsy...I am sorry for entertaining

the notion that quotes need to be in quotation parks,

it may have killed Mark...Two liver rooster, they employed

it's only rock and roll,
Mick in Orlando,
"a wall where peaches ripen";
 
no, i can't always get what i want.
yet neither can you,
 
where are my dreams
“i need you” said Skynrd,
named after a high school teacher
here exhausted he is only writing;
for a hint that whispered oh please,
another canto yes they shot Lennon
he thinks of the ballad, crucifixtion,

And yet “fiction,” games him up.

wind up, there must be something wrong.

with that word, latin crucifigere
“there;s only one headline today…”

radio voices, shot to death by hidden assassins,
China returns from the moon,
Mexico elects a woman -
all of this, prelude as he tries to settle into a groove
it's not like it used to be...the desolation;
arrows and he has lost count
of the dead natives.
Come for his head, come to scalp into insanity-
Even playing, phantom marty big iron,
Grave remodels Claro, draw for it,
Texas red clone...I can't even, as they say...
I'm raising Arizona over in a moment-
"weaving an endless sentence"
bookmaker's stake, you know some ammo
keeps on truckin'
pause;
And in further'd, memory 
Olympics bronze silver gold, the nail scars are true
not for history; but for the faith. the belief.
all those fragile leaves, clinging to that tree -
like I believe Russia is no enemy,
Proof at 1945. Well, except for raping the German 
women...There are no women like our women...
Damn the beauty of that gravesite! what is your endgame,
ireland. 
 
alone,  with her picture
or even with, her there.
chained to earth like the vampire dyke.
 
The synonyms don;t always work
in the newly found image;
she wears stars little and shiny,
across her collar,
it is not a wish of death, yet dying ain't we all.
 
Meanwhile, if you live it up you won't live it down,
other tom, i'm still in a wait, She went and took,
Contemporary that California trip
Against my colon and aromas. I get Jealous
Stagnant, even horny; I'm sure she wants to 
say I love you likewise or more...

yet even facing each other:
 
we will be bottled up,
Do you take this woman?  marriage when?
I took this woman three years ago
here an anniversary song, shaking from the lost,
Emilee exact date !
 
since curtain I am not staff - only an individual;
memory, validation for the shoe,
it was this time of the season...
i looked away not thinking not knowing
the truth, the love...
then the interruption, the delay,
how could there be anyone else...
air vanishing, i was dizzy...
 
not even recording for six months.
And all that day, becomes another day:
 
until evening falls and she calls,
cat quick my purr none of it matters 
shell or show only she mattress...
only she married...breathe
everything is fine but i can't use 
them pictures and i can't hear the name
 
which set such distractions;

even the other day, even today, tonight
it's all toxicesque, a jazz too fast to groove
making me wonder if madness
 
has been taking extra vitamins
but sanity needs her, needs that anniversary,
even the contrast and cost...
of it all since it proves a feeling,
like playing crosby i'm through with love
all afternoon weeping while she worked salon.

 
hennessy story my line about her smile,
was no allusion to work poster,
 
i'm not wearing any panties --
well we could, always adopt,
although the pregnant dream was so reel, real,
 
rael innocent even if guilty;
my virgin saint, 
 
i'm exhausted and i ate too much.
too bad it wasn't your pussy,
maybe a bit later, 
don't get me wrong, sex
 
not, with fears, cannibalism,

Although a bite or, mooning nibble upon bare hill
thrill still into a quev'ring
ah yes even to coin new word,
 
che guevara,
bolivia  blur stares at the new world order;

i take five tic tacs.

with a marlboro:
cigarette, ashes move before me,
 
the rainy night knows i am afraid.
The live wire pain sudden and vicious,
soul casino, even if i have placed no bet
well alien probes and satanic spirits trying 
on a talent like suspenders, spies
lift and leave, sometimes i think it's you,
insisting on something perhaps i cannot hear.
here...
Being more than they, 
hey, do you really love the smiths...
 
GE wandered into Chinatown bank.
sorry if i kissed like onion, 
i have a neverending need in red or white,
the fan whirls.
hoping to win the fender,
 
play you a love song,
that rises above the trite, something trippy.
traveling far away into tomorrow,
maybe even like this canto

The girl in dream, I'm sitting here with grin, she was holding a diploma, 

two fans blazing, then put-placing art over it. rain yet tinted with hotness.

I'm sure i dreamt other things, five June listin news calls I say yeah but

still debating it within myself...twenty twenty five seems a long ways 

away, things like that time I went dream apartment hunting with 

Caitlin...No one is yet to explain Ibiza to me...weren't it Max, Erin

oh kneel, is that why the American in Russia saunters into mind?

in any case, reason eight why i can't remember my dreams lately...

pretty sure it was new Manhattan York city - maybe it was even

Emilee, all I think about...all i care about today, said Lucy - 

Elton's barrel full of monkeys(,, Johnny the bossman* )handing

out bananas, I hope she is fine in her jury chair - where was I,

oh yes, despite the fact that dang Adobe went no more draw

or photoshop mix, flashback Serif (does my art really hold such

power that actual corporations shit I mean shift away products...)

I was feeling all right, thinking of the old bag, affectionately marie

anne - wd'ave put you in seven but sometimes when the thought

bomb goes off i can't jugle it all - idea run at arm...maybe someday

not a transition but a song quote you'll see that it's true

there was no greater love than what i had for you...

now then there, i'm with the grin 'cause suri was racing

around the big apple...i;d mentioned here right before

and enjoyed the near synchronicity, hell, i even took

out the Clorox and mop all the way to the living room...

*(that's what waters muddy called winter not the season -)

i'm not certain sure why he's considered a great given

that not really lead player nor an operatic voice,

still hard again is genius in terms of blues -

bliss at the rest of Miss Grant takes Richmond,

I asked my friends about her, but all their lips were tight -

our lips are seal'd. meal again onion rice chicken...

there's something divine about it most likely from

keira posting posing next to emilee...angel necklace

slave ring metallic teal toes...sixteen glass panel

window painted sea green with an anchor sticker

venus symbol above a heart...lean out your window

goldenhair, no i still don't know how i hit that double

triplet sounding ring, don't even think it can be tabbed...

while dancing with the thought that she was actually

right here, i got so shy i'm sure i blushed, i even sort 

of hoped she hadn't read some of the words herein,

why did i let it get so beatnik naked in terms of 

emotion -  cut reaction line, bring out

Lazarus machine for juice zest and sugar...

the future bleeds through -

i didn't get to sleep til after three again,

even had to overcome a sudden migraine as if the

spirit of fifi had visited, she of headaches when 

sexless...awaking near noon to lower back pain

as if someone had tried to fold me into a suitcase...

but maybe it was only the kitchen...at ritual meditation

i felt all right - forty minutes, graduated digestion

chainsmoke -  i felt i could even sing you're not

alone.

We all know the Beach Boys couldn't

I can see-feel the why reasons -

Six June seduced me and 

kept me up nearly into dawn -

no relation to the dish washing soap -

Of course, it wasn't the late night,

wasn't the day or date...A not so

simple twist of fate -

Reaching through air, through

space and time to make 

rhymes with her in rhythm's 

rhythm. A rhythm which swayed

into dreams. Dreams...Therein

ourselves asleep dreaming 

a nap, perhaps a sofa, maybe

it was my sofa bed -  retired

from living room and now

serving martin acoustic

and Ibanez electric...

sceptic glances - she is 

undressing yet not nude -

i am drooling in my mind

hopefully not rude - 

deep into her eyes, she is 

looking back at me -

the ronettes shld've been

singing be my baby -

turn my head

secret glances

her sister above my skull

i can't hear her words

septum ring smiles

i was wondering why

she seems fearless of the sun -

emilee has two sisters

these are my sisters...

crumbles the question

we have no dildos

possibly then i explain

it's literature too and 

dramatic effect...

et cetera in terms of 

big pink stun gun

not a recommendation 

something shoots emilee

a bit in the distance perhaps 

to dance - prancing in another

girl moves the blanket covering 

my bones, i look down at her,

at my boner - i don't want to make

the connection, the number you 

have reached is no longer in service,

please check the number and dial again -

i get up and it's only ten in the morning -

more in love than i had been even if

interrupted - i'll buy no dick, albino

winter that stranger sure sounded 

alike the dark side of the moon

track same year - i decide suddenly

during the ritual to set up for 

a new recording - lucky town -

i put it together, key of E

but when I strum along it is 

in F - well, maybe C...

i record two vocals quickly

escaping the deliveries 

i stacked on purpose all during

the calls to cancel my subscription

listin ounce don't throw

i haven't paid the bill, so it all 

dissolves into a density they can't

The record was released nearly immediately...

I wrote that song a few years ago, c major,

f major, g major...I always credit James

Caan as co-writer, but I don't want to explain it -

when i jotted down the notes for actually

recording it - it was f sharp minor,  F major,

C major, A major, Asus2...

but, as it turned out more like f /b flat/ g/ c...

done quickly on a headphone mix which

when heard on laptop speakers made me sick

as the drums held a sort of ten k frequency slpash

- a rinky dinky sound that took a couple of hours

to manage... at that point i couldn't hear what

i was doing...i decided to spectral pan the 

beat and hoped that my instinct (on headphone)

had been right concerning the rest of it - 

of course, being me, right after ritual "meditation"

i went in for a second take, this time in the key of A,

asus, bsus2, e major 6 (i think) which then breaks

into f#m & e but with a flip back note since i liked

the sound - again two vocals but this time used parts

of either take since i did not pronounce sweet as you 

in the first take - i had intended to imitate the 

Andrew Sisters' bugle boy 

you know that growl...

but when i got to it, my main 

concern was simply escaping into myself and this time

the only glitch was guitar volume, but that didn;t take 

so long to settle - yes i listened to the first (released)

version against this new one and even i don't know which

one works better...i called the second one lucky town 9,

estimating the number of rendered tracks since the first -

obviously lime posset ten is only keeping the title

and format, but not going for the intricate poetics...

as they say, just saying or even js

nothing to do with javascript -

in the wee hours i envision fbi agents attempting

to capture...me? well, maybe it was only a movie

memory...

in sleep, i dream of several people on the floor,

pale, seemingly horny...some are masturbating -

two men and several women, perhaps one couple

is having intercourse ---  i don't feel surprised

or even curious, i look at one woman and watch 

her also take to the floor, alone...i think, to touch

herself...there's something of a blur, no distinct

faces or features...i awake and think nothing of

it except until the following evening, a few hours

ago when i felt the scene re-live like an echo

in peripheral imagination myself not excited

only confounded - i sleep again not getting

out of bed and find myself baffled by someone

from the supermarket giving a speech about

the virgin mary - i don't care if it rains or 

freezes as long as i got my plastic jesus -

dashboard of the dream, i noonish get up

almost running from the scene - there's no 

trust there and it wasn't even in my language -

i shampoo my hair with a sudden back pain -

street legal set up to take out the trash - 

imaginary

crash into me both hips pain so severe i sit me down -

breathe and wonder who or what - 

when then order kfc, mostly to facilitate recording

so as to not worry about fixing a meal or dishes - 

1940 a film called he married his wife...

it's entertaining enough and of course the thought

of wife or married makes me think of emilee, although

constantly in my thoughts...

yes - i first met suri cruise in LaGuardia

when i lived in blue white bathroom with skankbang girls -

she's on her way to Carnegie Mellon

we wish her all possible success in Pittsburgh

but i notice as i ramble through my thinking into words

that i haven't mentioned emilee too much here -

maybe i am trying to give nine the chance to firm itself

to film its motion picture production in its selected

locations - the powers that be seemed to pick up

and plug into California...myself i cannot say

what the side effects will be, i can say it was 

not my target...volusia
		    
the sheriff called it pretty shocking -

as holly hills took over chief and captain resigned...

mailer told me if you kill a cop in the states 

point blank you are punk -

he didn't mean that in a rocking way -

i certainly don't mean or aim to be a punk - 

but as i pulled the proverbial ring from grenade

vest poem my mind whispered, for Mathilda...

lando, land ho - 

singing songs of shady sisters
and old time liberty
songs of love and songs of death
and songs that set men free

in any case, it may be that i was overwhelmed 

by something she said "a metaphor"

(i want my hair to go up in flames
for the one i love 
to paradoxically be ignited and extinguished
only by their touch
to burn and burn
and have them catch fire beneath me)

"lust and longing" she may be late

for i long ago fell into the burning  fire

down down down as in the song the flames 

went higher...yet what a nearly perfect poem.

perhaps writing here today not wanting

to throw my hat in the ring -

yes let that be the verse of the day tonight.

it is no easy job to work a song,

i didn't mean to make it sound 

like it was - i remember in chronicles

Dylan "talked" about Man in the Long Black

Coat - he mentioned Johnny Cash or 

Hank Williams...something about the 

order of the words as if they had been

set that way before they were wroted -

theirs not his as he is not 

one to brag...if memory serves...

Lucky Town is one of the few of mine

that I can't imagine having any other 

words - that logic of Lost Highway, 

or Walk the Line and yes that one 

from Oh Mercy...although for my

money it's Ring Them Bells...

but I can see why lead off

with Political World...
	
all this to say that I'm extremely

pleased to share it with emilee.

double cream:	
_______________

down teh street them dogs are barkin, ah no 

it's a jane's addiction record. one too many

more than thoughts and a thousand emilee's

try to move in - pay for it - pain for  it...

trying to not football myself into dreams -

do you hear voices, i'll pay you back -

don't we all - no idea who might be talking -

everybody's talking, way past midnight

cowboys, i'm walking here -

wonder if i'm being too aggressive

in my own fan tah sea -

swimming into dreams with the 

day starting, i find myself dreaming

of keira, she had been on my mind

yet i wasn't sure why as i wasn't certain

about the dreams - vague conversations,

alike sitting around speaking without

trying for a keeping...in the mid morning,

i awake to the sound of a foreign

tongue, is it a las tres, or is it ala trez

third tine of an antler's beam

perhaps allah tress, akbar - but allah

is also a woman's name in the cyrilic -

i cycle through these thoughts feeling

still keira and missing emilee -

still, i don't want to crowd her - 

then and there or here now where

readers might decode it as repetition - 

i can't help it, as she says it

how you feel is how you feel about it,

paraphrase...yes i could be fiction,

make something up to entertain

but why should i? do i have to prove

anything - no. i daydream, i have a 

meltdown, what if she wants me to cut

my hair, can i really give up pepsi to

please her coca cola preference, isn't it

bad enough serving skirt...a whole woman

would be even more work - - - i get nervous

i go right up to the grounds of depression,

what am i thinking - i feel like crying -

all of it together is overwhelming -

smoke, to smoke more that is what i 

need, but not these, no cough cough -

i carve out a plan -  i call a taxi

to the store still in fear of the previous

experiences while sauntering - 

virgin olive oil, rice, friskies, and

a hundred and twenty cigarettes

no make that a hundred and sixty -

women in tight white dresses glide

by on their way to atm -

i decide to tip the cashier that

said hey instead of the sour faced

one that has merged with the register

and has become more machine than human -

back home, in minutes, but some ghostly

hamstring hounds my left leg, i sit in the

baby jesus tub letting the heat and pain

disperse...who is the disaster, your guess

as good as mine - i feel so skinny that 

i have an extra slice of bread - 

runaround myself against the dishes -

steak with both types of onion - 

siesta with the end of the film.

"They call them cold-blooded killers

They say they are heartless and mean

But I say this with pride, I once knew Clyde

When he was honest and upright and clean.

But the laws fooled around and taking him down

and locking him up in a cell

'Til he said to me, "I’ll never be free,

So I’ll meet a few of them in hell..."



man i like pizza and poetry

didn't ask to be cuffed

slapped and roughed

up tackled...funny


feeling the aim

of stop or i'll shoot

circle writing fame

not for it to loot


no crime or record

greasy kid stuff 

mustang horse not ford

around hometown puff


still hated the thugs

not the thin blue line

until recent hugs

invading my borderline


murder incorporated mop

even last week flash light swirl

call the tsunami island hop

but that thing about my girl


well i already said my peace

no limit the cost of a slight

Volusia voodoo sleaze

you know i'm right


man i like rock and roll and a movie

she didn't ask me to say it or to help serve

you see even if pain's gone groovy

i know i felt it and the memory does not curve.




"Now I'm twenty one years, I might make twenty two

And I don't mind dying but for the love of you

And if fate should break my stride

Then I'll give you my Vincent to ride..."

 remember this room do I 
I could close my eyes and paint you a portrait 
with my big toe 

 at my wedding was I 
 [Music]
would you like to order now 

 love is calling us to transform 
 knocked oh my goodness 
 I can't remember anything but us 

oh stop stalking me
 she's the smartest thing 
she knows just what we're talking about 

 man you you you fat Flathead 
 I seem to detect a faint glimmer of  juicy 
 insult to you I want to communicate my feelings 

we're going down to Hillsboro
 I hear him will you please go down
 and tell him that he's honking up the wrong tree 

 I think you're a very nasty little boy 
 well goodbye Mama goodbye 
 ladies and gentlemen he's remounting 

yes he's he's up again 
 Restless as the horses 
 I pronounce a swivel neck 


 I pronounce claim that you two 
are here by neck and neck 
 they're turning into the stretch 

gone to the whip it's going
 wild come on come on 
almost a picture finished picture
