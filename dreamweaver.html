      <div class="content-text">
        hmm...14 July 2025.<br>
		i dedicated June to not much at all -<br>
		it felt as if i had wroted a novel<br>
		instead of dream notes...i kept<br>
		wondering over the puzzle of the<br>
		last penned dream herein...it <br>
		was too vivid, maybe too much...<br>
		i only knew that i had to end<br>
		the notes there in order to <br>
		start over...it was an estimated<br>
		three hundred pages if double spaced -<br>
		well, i've put those away and here<br>
		goes...monday, daria called her<br>
		puppy her soulmate...i felt in <br>
		a daze...on the fifth of july,<br>
		i happend to see a picture of<br>
		two friends, children...i kept <br>
		wishing i hadnt seen it, but<br>
		even as cut off as i am from <br>
		most folks and i suppose even <br>
		some of my own emotions, that<br>
		scene really got to me...<br>
		i was in the middle of writing<br>
		some new songs and wrote four<br>
		verses...the fourth was left out<br>
		when it came to recording - <br>
		it took a couple of days to settle <br>
		into it...when i finally escaped<br>
		noisy distractions, the sudden phone<br>
		calls insisting on either hanging up or<br>
		pointless trivia, the strange hound<br>
		seemingly in search of boy-vagina,<br>
		and an insane argument about the beach...<br>
		(what else could it be except madness when<br>
		i have no inclination or desire to sit in the sun)<br>
		oh yes and the bizarre 'no input' mystery<br>
		which i suppose is all part of the process, like<br>
		pound might say...<br>indeed, when i finally escaped<br>
		nothing mattered but the work at hand...i called<br>
		it 'the fifth of july' and put it out for release<br>
		with these lyrics;<br>
		<BR>
		I KNEW LILA WAS DEAD <br>
		- HOPED ELOISE WOULD SURVIVE;<br>
		SHE LOVED HER PUPPY DOG, <br>
		SHE HADNT EVER BEEN WED.<br>
<br>
		A HOUSE DANCED <br>
		ON A RIVER'S SONG AS IT PLAYED<br>
		LONE STAR STATE OF TEXAS <br>
		YEAH SOMEHOW STAYED...<br>
<br>
		I COULDNT TELL HANNAH AND REBECCA APART<br>
		- THEY WERE TWINS LIKE<br>
		FLOWERS IN A FIELD'S GARDEN <br>
		- IT'D BEEN THAT WAY RIGHT FROM THE START<br>
		<br>
		A HOUSE DANCED<br>
		UPON A RIVER <br>
		(A RIVER'S SONG AS IT PLAYED)<br>
		LONE STAR STATE OF TEXAS<br>
		WE SOMEHOW STAYED...<br>
		<BR>
		LITTLE BLAIR COULDNT UNDERSTAND <br>
		- SHE WEPT SHE CRIED;<br>
		LITTLE BROOKE COVERED HER <br>
		SAYING COME ON GIRL HOLD MY HAND<br>
		
		<br>
		A HOUSE DANCED <br>
		UPON A RIVER'S SONG AS IT PLAYED<br>
		LONE STAR STATE OF TEXAS<br>
		WE SOMEHOW STAYED...<br>
		<BR>
		
		A HOUSE DANCED <br>
		UPON A RIVER <br>
		(A RIVER'S SONG AS IT PLAYED)<br>
		LONE STAR STATE OF TEXAS <br>
		WE SOMEHOW STAYED...<br>
		<BR>         
		      
		      i'd put placed all four verses on vsco from <br>
		handwritten notes photographed along with the chords<br>
		which remained the same...save for an added note<br>
                musical note. <br>
		as i glance through recollections, wondering why julia<br>
		mecey and joey king enjoy love island, wondering if<br>
		charles bukowski actually dropped a man at the race track<br>
		as in the italic section of factum or even why sylvia<br>
		plath's ghost doesnt haunt the hell out of matt haig...<br>
		i remember that night, the fourth of july...<br>
		i dreamt something like a bridge or a dam where the water<br>
		was red, crimson, but in that nearly dried blood brown color<br>
		and i couldn't see where i was but i saw a man holding a shotgun<br>
		and he did not move or speak, the motionless image against the <br>
		waves were etched in my mind the following day...i thought it<br>
		was about a guitar that had been slow to arrive and that<br>
		possibly it had suffered in transit yet by the time i went to<br>
		sleep again it felt revealed...well, decyphered...neither spirit<br>
		nor worry could save these lives from the devastation waltz<br>
		winding its way in what they call flash flood alley...<br>
		i was certain it was william s burroughs, a man who knew<br>
		about loss in an intimate way...aside from the wife, his only<br>
		son had perished and even in the afterlife i suppose some<br>
		emotions keep, all you can do is stand there and bear witness<br>
		i learned also that gabrielle's mother and my own share<br>
		a birthdate as it were...<br>
		i don't want to write anymore about these things as in<br> 
		typing i might not reflect how much i felt and much less<br>
		how it all still hurts and will continue to hurt so many...<br>
		so i re-order that guitar and continue to wait...<br>
		i have a few dreams to jot, but those will be done<br>
		at some other point in time when i can turn my minimalist<br>
		writing into an even more concise style so as to not end<br>
		up with a book-length manuscript that might only serve<br>
		self-references...<br>
		
		<br>
		<br>
		16 july 2025<br>
		<br>
		i consider yesterday notable even if i don't<br>
		fully examine it here...<br>
		learning another side of the camp story...<br>
		what was her name, hayden...well she spoke<br>
		kinda like how i speak...<br>
		the second axe was shipped on the 11th<br>
		and arrived on the 15th<br>
		it felt as if my writing had manifested it...<br>
		reminds me of the telecaster except it <br>
		has a decided rock and roll tone<br>
		(no single coil pick ups)<br>
		i decorated it while listening to mustang sally<br>
		for a minute, everything else took a back seat<br>
		meaning it was thrilling...<br>
		i'm thinking now of a dream i had in may<br>
		i'd been with lotta in my old apartment<br>
		she kissed me and it was magical<br>
		we lay there talking about what the next meal<br>
		should be when a man with gun started shooting<br>
		at me and i ran into another room<br>
		there is a bookend dream to this scene which<br>
		i will jot later...<br>
		she's watching the summer i turned pretty<br>
		which i looked at but found revolting<br>
		i'm wearing a snake ring on my middle finger<br>
		instead of my stainless steel spoon since<br>
		some sort of rust invaded it...<br>
		anyway i awoke with a racing heart and <br>
		the realization of how much she means to me<br>
		hmm...when i said not much in june i meant movies too<br>
		although i did watch most of the secret life <br>
		of the american teenager<br>
		well, this was more than i intended to note...<br>
		let's leave it at that - for now -<br>
		here are two outtakes of the song i mentioned<br>
		i had the intent to adjust my release for one of<br>
		these but i couldn't figure out how to do that<br>
		and i am aware that this sort of takes the<br>
		expectation away from the single but i want <br>
		to share these as a way of saying it is<br>
		not about streams or whatever, it is what it is.<br>

		      correction, the mustang only sounded like
		      that through the boss amp...at the fender,
		      it was much nicer...yes i was fender-reluctant,
		      but since i don't much use pedals, the champ
		      amp was only logical...as for the guitar,
		      i kept hearing a line from blind willie mctell
		      when i would go window shopping for axes until
		      finally i didn't want to be haunted by it...
		      it is a step up from the ancient mustang i 
		      had which hardly ever stayed in tune but it
		      is not for big hands, even mine feel it to 
		      be a task going up the fret as if i had to
		      abbreviate my fingers which is the exact 
		      opposite of the jackson wherein my hands
		      sense and appropiate the space...
		      at least i feel a sort of bulgari vibe with
		      my new ring...still, all this goes against
		      my attempt at brevity and i have yet to
		      jot the dream note...hmm, notes..
		      connie francis died and her song had
		      recently become a hit again...even a parody
		      emerged, "you can touch my pussy..." which might
		      have been the cause of her demise...but
		      many several poets also passed away
		      and i had the evil urge to make a list
		      of all the writers that had perished
		      after 'the tortured poets depart-ment'
		      hmm...but what really worries me is
		      the grammar when gender is made illogical-
		      andrea is called 'they' instead of she -
		      here is quote/example:
		      "Their father, Mark, worked for a post office
		      and their mother, Shirley, was a secretary at a 
		      technical college. They have one sister, Laura."
		      this plural form makes language more of a virus
		      than it needs to be, indeed and why? 
		      where was i...ah yeah, i find 
		      lately that i go to sleep only to awake 
		      an hour or so later simply to wander
		      around in confusion...that was the case
		      last night, but first the bookend thing;
		      i had walked into a shop with julia and
		      told her to get something to drink, there
		      were only cans of coors in the fridge...
		      we walked out and there and then several
		      men harassed us, one of them with a stick
		      that knocked the hat off my head...it had
		      been a goodly time until then...weeks later
		      i learned that she had lost her red baseball cap -
		      cut to yesterady, i'm in the bath and the bath
		      is overflowing, i am trying without luck to 
		      shut off the water as somehow there are more
		      knobs than i care to count, i say the words
		      julia help but as i do i find the right knob
		      then we are on a bed where a cat climbs up,
		      i remark that it is not skirt and i think of
		      hedwig who it resembles but as a kitten - 
		      the cat speaks and i wonder if we have all gone
		      crazy...i awake and can't get back to sleep until
		      half a pack of cigarettes and coffee argue with
		      melatonin...i kept seeing romy mars although i 
		      only 'met' her at some far away chanel thing...
		      i like her especially since she positively proves
		      my point that sofia was and is pretty...the only 
		      thing is it makes mayhem of my fantasy life...
		      love her ego song - so catchy...
		      she had a bad scene at some hotel, in my dream
		      which i thought was about michael madsen, another
		      poet, i was in the elevator trying to get to the
		      twenty ninth floor - there was no 29 button,
		      someone pressed all the buttons and i got out
		      on seventeen determined to navigate the stairs -
		      1920s elegance surrounded me, someone with a 
		      glass case of coins, collectables, and aritfacts
		      was set up like a cigarette girl might be and 
		      i stopped for a glance there and then noticing 
		      a man seemingly having a heart attack nearby,
		      i kept walking after thinking about it all for 
		      a minute - as i contemplate it now it was like
		      the waldorf astoria...a minute ago having a grand
		      re-birth...i'd been there once upon a late night
		      frenzy...but i don't remember any stairs...not even 
		      much walking as yellow cabs did the work...miss
		      morin was at the chelsea hotel, i took a peek at 
		      how upscale 23rd street is now...i think it's where i 
		      bought that other mustang...i think it's still
		      there unlike music row on 48th...anyway, yes poets
		      are supposed to die like everyone else while
		      a few songs and verses live on but is it time
		      to advocate for protection of the scribes...
		      well, i dunno, but if someone whats to protect
		      me - please do but get Daria safe before that...

		      <br>
		      not sure what to call this...an update? an
		      explanation...well whatever it is, the thing
		      is that last month i decided to make these
		      notes wait until the song was released, which
		      i expected to be a matter of days or a week...
		      there are several many dreams on the backlog...
		      but maybe this will help me make it all more
		      concise...still, i don't want anyone thinking
		      that i have been putting the dreamweaver page
		      on the backburner...on the offchance that
		      new visitors arrive or that i have upset
		      followers, i am put-placing the earlier notes
		      back in some sort of extra html box...meanwhile,
		      i still expect the track to be released any minute
		      now...i am reading charlotte bronte's villete,
		      i had more of a party than i expected with charles
		      bukowski's hollywood...nearly as lavish as pulp,
		      now i am in the middle of a cheesy slasher ride
		      called graduation day - this after viewing
		      red sun and wondering who would find the sword
		      left hanging there on the train wires...i think
		      i have entered into the veritas guitar giveaway
		      and i will be beside myself if i happen to win -
		      hmm i was thinking about love letters from a portuguese
		      nun as i wondered why it had such an impact on me...i couldn't
		      figure it out, as i looked at it again everyone seemed
		      to differ from my recollection but i saw why or partly
		      why kia attracted me...there is a similarity between
		      her and susan hemingway...it was then that robyn disappeared
		      and i viewed ballerina which i felt was too much into
		      developing the backstory and training only to be clumsy
		      but it came through in the end with some help from
		      keanu and a flamethrower...being maria was extremely
		      hard to get through, as i think highly of LTIP yet
		      this never gives you a way to care for ms schneider - 
		      the element of spoiled brat never leaves...despite
		      the stories, she and brando remained friends although
		      it is true that the same cannot be said for bertolucci -
		      you see there is no way to win, obviously i can't dismiss
		      a woman's suffering but i cannot badmouth bertolucci as
		      the only director that ever mailed me directly as if 
		      i were on his level...well, some situations have no
		      distinct resolution...let's see i also took a look at
		      meghan 2.0 but the wonder of the first has worn off in 
		      this sequel - didn't they see the fabulous potential
		      of the opening story with an ai model gone beserk...
		      dude, that was the movie and then end it with the 
		      promise of meghan being re-built for a third film...well,
		      it didnt leave a bad taste yet mostly that's the way i
		      saw it...like they threw everything at the audience hoping
		      something would stick...finally, cold sweat was all right
		      but here too they purposely posed the little girl to 
		      give men upskirt panty shots...no reason at all unless there 
		      is something about bastille day they haven't told me...
		      yeah, dream notes will return when the song is out. 
		      <br>

				  9 august 2025
		     the fifth of july was released on the eighth of august, i was
				  immersed in establishing a balance in terms of of music
				  software that is to say uninstalling this and installing
				  that...mostly this involved native instruments...it felt
				  as if had been suddenly rewarded for my efforts which 
				  was an all nighter that went past noon given that the
				  second laptop requested an update that was slow and 
				  resulted in me foolishly deleting the onedrive documents
				  folder which turned out to be the actual and only document
				  container...it wasnt in the live trash to restore and it
				  seems to have took the restore points too...so there was
				  the matter to checklist the missing things and get as many 
				  back as possible except i don't know what was there exactly
				  or why it took up so much space since i only use that for music -
				  reminds me to double check if anything else needs to be put placed
				  therein again...in any case, i felt good and sensed it as a turning
				  point although part of me wished to go back to typewriters
				  and tape recorders...in my dream there was some sort of 
				  discussion, could some beds be countries...the other afternoon
				  i awoke to a vision of a chinese letter or note which dissolved
				  into dots as if translated morse code...i say it is a vision since
				  it was there at the moment i awoke and vanished while i got up -
				  daria returned from sicily and wore a revealing red dress, i was
				  pretty surprised when she said she was switching schools as she
				  counted her shoes...i freaked out over julia presenting her
				  neighbor as a best friend while worried that it would in turn
				  give my own next door upstairs or downstairs an entrance...
				  ironically i have never felt so attracted to the other julia...
				  well lets get irony out of the way - lotta said she broke up
				  with someone that she had gone to mallorca and taken home...
				  i hesitate to spell out my suspicion that is was her manager,
				  but it is only logical to consider being that she specificied
				  him as a companion during her first trip to france...i sensed
				  it then but there may be more to the story than meets the eye
				  and it is nobody's business, i only mention it in passing to 
				  show myself how foolish i can still be...but what will i do
				  with these feelings and these memorized imprints within the
				  mind's eye...germany suspends military aid to israel...alaska
				  takes center stage...i realize that having a lot of guitars
				  also brings the dilemma of which one to play...agency heads
				  perish, stella then william, for a minute, as i glanced at
				  writings and songs i thought to myself i've overdone it, i've
				  taken on too much...yet it is an age of excess, is it not? 
				  i'm nearing chapter twenty of villette and i like it thus
				  far - i started to view harvest yet i realized that i was too
				  distracted and tired and hopefully can give it the attention it
				  deserves today...i'm happy to return here for these erratic
				  notes and i have a hell of ghost story for you next time...

				  i do not feel myself to be a stranger to ghosts...at least
				  not in dreams...i have felt their visits like angels on
				  parole from heaven's jail...here you go, take a few minutes
				  for the living...ever since i started writing i thought of
				  the words are we dead that live to tell, i thought also of
				  fame is the sun that shines on the dead, well i thought of
				  many things but these in relation to that...in any case, 
				  it's nothing i can prove, what proof is there within the
				  unconsciousness...only the shadows within memory...in the
				  case of my uncle, i would amend the statement to be from
				  hell's confines or perhpas via purgatory's expiation, do
				  a good deed and we'll let you go home, as it were...
				  i don't think the church kept that middle ground it's
				  weird that it comes to mind on the heels of the hand of dante,
				  who ofcourse included it in his divine comedy - 
				  where was i well i was stopped thrice at returning here,
				  first the subject matter - in this occasion it wasnt a
				  member of the family, it was someone i employed...i saw
				  him for the last time on the street, circa 108 or 109
				  broadway, he remarked about my countenance as if surprised,
				  i didn't know what to say and said it was plastic surgery -
				  in fact thinking of Elvis who i had heard say to get it
				  early so it wouldnt have to be so drastic et cetera...
				  listening to undescribably blue a dozen times yesterday
				  after the anniversary of his death...he'd gotten a bit
				  crude in a car as the documentary rolled, i think now,
				  so somehow this all fits together as in the dream it was
				  a car, the centerpiece was a car - unlike my dream last
				  night of leah telling me we were friends and then awaking 
				  to think it was bentley whi i had suggested be considered
				  to play sinead although she is neither an actor or singer
				  yet you can't look at her and not see the resemblance
				  once it's pointed out...in that dream i think he pointed at
				  the car, i was with a girl, not sure who - he was with another,
				  i put my girl in the back seat and got in the front seat - 
				  then he got into the driver's seat with his girl sort of upon him
				  but they kept shifting and sexually so until he ejaculated on 
				  her face yet all the while looking at me in the end with 
				  some sort of cruel satisfaction i could not understand as i
				  awoke...a precise memory of something he had told me led me
				  to believe that it was a ghost, no imagination or product of
				  mind, miller and aspirin, this was his recipe to last longer
				  during intercourse...you load up on miller high life beer
				  and get a couple of aspirin...subsequently i wondered if
				  ghosts actually had sex in the afterlife, they never really
				  frighten me and this was no different in that sense but it 
				  sure was intense and i sort of wish i knew what it meant...
				  i thought about it briefly again while watching the very
				  strange the night always comes...mazda madness...eddington
				  shows us the madness created at the start of the pandemic -
				  i recalled my argument that there was no logic to it, 
				  like prohibiting driving so there'd be no accidents...
				  because even walking one might stumble and fall...
				  ah yes, i was shocked to see walk hard the dewey cox
				  story...but i will refrain from commentizing upon it -
				  as i will remain silent on harvest, which is in a class
				  of its own. now then, or secondly, i was stopped by the
				  awful feeling of the delay fact...my spirits, high in
				  expectation of a haul that should have been arriving,
				  were brought down low as the package was sent out a week
				  later than i thought...so all that won't be here until
				  next week...look at my very own first world problem!
				  and finally well thirdly, i was stopped by the insight
				  in a passage within villete, i imagine very few people
				  will comprehend but it contains a severe truth and
				  that along with the fact that the novel might have
				  peaked in the middle gave me pause; yes i know it
				  is a long passage, but i must put-place it here
				  so as to have it available...
				  from chapter 24;
				  "Those who live in retirement, whose lives have fallen amid the seclusion of schools 
				  or of other walled-in and guarded dwellings, are liable to be suddenly and for a long 
				  while dropped out of the memory of their friends, the denizens of a freer world. 
				  Unaccountably, perhaps, and close upon some space of unusually frequent intercourse⁠—some 
				  congeries of rather exciting little circumstances, whose natural sequel would rather seem
				  to be the quickening than the suspension of communication⁠—there falls a stilly pause,
				  a wordless silence, a long blank of oblivion. Unbroken always is this blank; alike entire
				  and unexplained. The letter, the message once frequent, are cut off; the visit, formerly
				  periodical, ceases to occur; the book, paper, or other token that indicated remembrance, comes no more.

Always there are excellent reasons for these lapses, if the hermit but knew them. Though he is stagnant in his 
				  cell, his connections without are whirling in the very vortex of life. That void interval 
				  which passes for him so slowly that the very clocks seem at a stand, and the wingless hours 
				  plod by in the likeness of tired tramps prone to rest at milestones⁠—that same interval, 
				  perhaps, teems with events, and pants with hurry for his friends.

The hermit⁠—if he be a sensible hermit⁠—will swallow his own thoughts, and lock up his own emotions during these
				  weeks of inward winter. He will know that Destiny designed him to imitate, on occasion, the 
				  dormouse, and he will be conformable: make a tidy ball of himself, creep into a hole of life’s
				  wall, and submit decently to the drift which blows in and soon blocks him up, preserving him in ice for the season.

Let him say, “It is quite right: it ought to be so, since so it is.” And, perhaps, one day his snow-sepulchre will open,
				  spring’s softness will return, the sun and south-wind will reach him; the budding of hedges, 
				  and carolling of birds, and singing of liberated streams, will call him to kindly resurrection.
				  Perhaps this may be the case, perhaps not: the frost may get into his heart and never thaw more; 
				  when spring comes, a crow or a pie may pick out of the wall only his dormouse-bones. Well,
				  even in that case, all will be right: it is to be supposed he knew from the first he was mortal, 
				  and must one day go the way of all flesh, “As well soon as syne.”

Following that eventful evening at the theatre, came for me seven weeks as bare as seven sheets of blank paper: 
				  no word was written on one of them; not a visit, not a token.

About the middle of that time I entertained fancies that something had happened to my friends at La Terrasse. 
				  The mid-blank is always a beclouded point for the solitary: his nerves ache with the strain of long expectancy; 
				  the doubts hitherto repelled gather now to a mass and⁠—strong in accumulation⁠—roll back upon him with a force
				  which savours of vindictiveness. Night, too, becomes an unkindly time, and sleep and his nature cannot agree:
				  strange starts and struggles harass his couch; the sinister band of bad dreams, with horror of calamity,
				  and sick dread of entire desertion at their head, join the league against him. Poor wretch! 
				  He does his best to bear up, but he is a poor, pallid, wasting wretch, despite that best."

				  well, yes these are the lyrics to nobody knows you when you're down and out - 
				  which is possibly a point charlotte missed...but there were no blues back then...
				  still, to think she could - by turning her character into a man with poetic
				  intersections describing a solitary existence - conjure those emotions
				  by put-placing seven weeks as the timeline...herself, always surrounded
				  by others and eventually even married, was not intimate with loneliness
				  in the sense of lacking company...still, like the words in i'm just a
				  gigolo, there's something to it, you might agree...i certainly do, having
				  spent much more time than seven weeks without companionship...my point is
				  then what would she pen if she imagined it to be seven months, or years...
				  in my dream helena is in an involved conversation...i'm hearing her yet
				  i am not sure if i am there with her or not...the only way i can describe
				  it is to say i had no peripheral vision, my eyes were locked in looking
				  ahead into nothing specific or a specific nothingness...an abstraction -
				  she was speaking of legacy as if a time travel spy, for a minute i thought
				  it was to let me know what would become of my writing but i was either
				  too horny or more likely sure that it would be just like it should and
				  didn't want a fortune teller as it were...i should interrupt myself
				  and interject briefly on how once in a while women will contact me
				  -usually to join a dating site, or more frequently with a provocative photo
				  and a note stating how they need or want this or that in random succession,
				  spam as it were that i barely glance of or take notice, less frequently
				  it is an actual letter with convoluted details form european women
				  intent on what they call a serious relationship, then there are a few
				  requests to chat...since these are few i do answer as i sometimes politely
				  turn down the others...early in the month a woman named mary started to message.
				  it was, to my surprise, nearly normal with none of the usual weirdness that
				  i have pointed to here - of course this was balanced by her wanting me
				  to invest in future trading...still it all felt friendly and maybe well
				  intentioned until i noticed her reluctance to be 'seen' in terms of
				  me posting her picture...and when her voice didnt match her features, 
				  she claimed she had lived overseas when young and so on and so forth -
				  well i suppose i will never know as she then disappeared for a while
				  only to return for a final confrontation in which she turned logic on 
				  its very head by deleting the thread and calling me an extreme pervert!
				  a good title for something i suppose, now i don't know what she meant
				  but i am positive she was hiding something...i was talking about hair
				  styles and shaved heads...still it brought the lonesome side of things
				  into focus...so i'm saying to myself, am i even able to have a conversation
				  with someone else...can i even afford a friend...but worse, and i don't
				  like to admit it, is it now so settled in me, this luxury this freedom
				  of being by myself that i cannot in a sense share in terms of companionship.
				  i seem to be able to do so with my cat and my guitars yet i don't know. 
				  my one concern is that by divulging or declassifying such notions, is
				  that it will sound as if a protest. it ain't, it's merely a fact with
				  a bit of an opinion that is maybe grounding its roots or being pulled
				  from its place to be replanted on more solid land.

				  on of the last times i turned on my television was to gawk
				  at would be the next to last mission impossible film - gee
				  that was an awful good time...so i had some expectations
				  with the conclusion of this series...after setting up the
				  sony, i settled in to it...however i found i had no way 
				  of pausing due to the cable remote being for functions
				  unralted to the usb drive and the natural remote itself
				  unresponsive to new batteries and slaps...already it was
				  a mission in itself as i then downloaded andraid apps
				  that all failed since lacking the ir blaster as they 
				  call it...giving up an turning to one of the laptops,
				  i found a much clearer picture, at least...but i was a
				  bit distracted given the aforementioned runaround - 
				  and then the underwater scenes battled with james 
				  bond scenes in memory as did the high flying sequences
				  near the end find themselves contrasted with hell's angels -
				  i mean i knew i was looking at very rare and special cinema
				  history but films for me an experience that require a
				  preset disposition, that is to say simply the agreement
				  within one;s self to go watch a movie...in fact my idea
				  was the opposite as i wanted to finish up villette, yet
				  sensing opportunity well...let us say i did not like it
				  as much as the other one yet there is no doubt that it
				  is awe inspiring. it also bitter sweet, as nothing in
				  production will wield such raw power for an incredible
				  cross section of people...in any casem does one buy a 
				  new remote or overhaul the equipment entirely...
				  in my dream, i am sitting with some girls, it is a restaurant,
				  a rare dream for me...but i am sitting there like a thief
				  planning on how to carry all the things i plan to steal...
				  i got up at midnight, feeling weird over it and not even
				  sure where it was or who they were...in the mary timeline,
				  i will have you know, there was another catfish, i say this
				  now certain of who the actual woman in the photo is...
				  someone named rose, who must be insane or intent on making
				  me feel as if crazed...no need to extend the story as it
				  might serve itself better in terms of fiction...no way it
				  could be poetry...i went to sleep for a few more hours
				  hoping i would catch my new contact in hong kong before 
				  nightfall...you know, the twelve hour time zone difference -
				  speaking of hours, i'm only a few away from concluding
				  villette, at dawn i cooked rice and made the chicken
				  peppery with onion, lime, and olive oil. the meal brought
				  a drowsy sensation i fought off not wanting to spoil 
				  the gains i made in terms of my desired schedule.
				  i hesitated through coffee and cigarettes yet jotted
				  these words hoping to get even more done in the sense
				  of recording or mixing music for production.

				  THE SUMMER WITHOUT POETRY
				  <br>
				  <br>
				  nothing beats a jet two holiday
				  echo until the eagle has landed
				  revved up crowds with sydney jeans
				  when her sammy davis movie wrapped
				  we can look back at the irony later
				  antlers and moose meat alaska
				  summit sees leaders greet
				  night witch spirit
				  polina gelman
				  i filter it through awake 
				  on my airplane nightmare
				  six thousand words added

				  is darfur a rumor?
				  how many roads can a man walk

				  pakistan itself a rhyme civil war

				  eternity itself attacked by houthi,

				  the heat it even stinks 
				  of smoke from wildfires,
				  the heatwave hits my ass as i sit -
				  a donkey packed with a bomb booms
				  colombia, nigeria worse did we mention
				  myanmar, yemeni, yeah man it's too many
				  it's too much kamchatka nasa looks
				  to see if we can go to mars rightaway

				  of congo hey hey rock and roll is here

				  chords and i don't think i wish or want
				  to...would you? someone started sex
				  video pizza sales and i study the matter
				  lamenting the once upon time innocent
				  and nearly universal word, brooke's 
				  husband sells pizza, hell, she even got
				  a slice tattoo on her arm...simultaneously
				  i finally understand the term catfishing -
				  i know i should prolly not speak into the
				  unknown yet something within requires
				  interaction - except in my dream i am
				  packing up, not from the plantation but
				  aunt's gone old house, i clearly see
				  my plaid pierre cardin cotton robe and
				  grab it heading down the stairs only
				  to find two chained dogs fiercely barking
				  on the right side and then a solitary puppy
				  perhaps like winnie hey leah didnt say if
				  it was marymount my old school except with
				  one eye closed or missing itself in a fright
				  myself estimating the space to slip through
				  this canine puzzle, but i awake before i can
				  make sense of it all - it's marie anne's 
				  day, a lot of this happened last month yet
				  a lot of it is still going on...i told julia
				  that i loved her for saying she would rather 
				  suck the toes of a man that hadn't washed 
				  his feet in ahundred days than watch some
				  summer i turned pretty scene...conrad murray
				  was the michael jackson doctor, i come
				  across the five's abc...there was nothing
				  like it until hanson's mmmbop, i'm at all
				  the bebop scales on my shirley flying v -
				  still an inertia zen settles in as if 
				  we were all meant to doom scroll for free,
				  well maybe it is freedom, liberty herself
				  went to denmark after returning from saint
				  tropez from denmark itself via england...
				  i feel i have known amaryllis without meeting
				  her and in amarillo burl 'bj' jackson chester
				  died possibly from team conrad syndrome -
				  i've been riffing on get behind the mule
				  and killed it yesterday...white stratocaster
				  that gave me hell, go ahead brag, go ahead rave...
				  now i don't think ozzy osbourne is going to 
				  be nominated or made a saint, despite what
				  lucy snow thinks about the catholic church, 
				  i tell mother protestantism is in the blood,
				  but i didn't say anything about him and sort of want to
				  sort it out here and now as a conclusion to
				  prose-poem shock news shavings, there was a 
				  minute wherein nothing else was on, a final
				  concert that really was saintly and an army
				  of guitarists picking on momma i'm coming home,
				  someone postulated that it was a zeitgeist!
				  myself, i was puzzled. i thought of the scene
				  wherein he pissed by the pool and dropped down
				  to lick the tiles, this ain't saying i didn't
				  like the man - i did, i only felt that the hype
				  was indeed somehow out of tune...too much or
				  not enough? i can't say, it's the emotion i 
				  suppose that one might encounter if most of 
				  us looked the other way while the war pigs 
				  went about their business, by the way, it's
				  a protest song in the folk sense...now you 
				  might ask what i think it should have been
				  like or expected...i reckon something more
				  underground, something in keeping with his
				  persona or style...who the fuck is justin 
				  bieber, the wynn hotel is asking...yeah, something
				  that didnt parade in a procession so heavy
				  that it hardly left a trace...or did everyone
				  hail satan as if not knowing shit about fuck...
				  have i got too vulgar, good he would have enjoyed
				  that, a twenty something couple having condomed
				  sex decide to go for a get pregnant try and proceed
				  to turn the rubber inside out after ejaculation
				  as the romp continues or perhaps it was Jesus 
				  gone insane from prayers
				  to john michael osbourne, rest in metal.
				  meanwhile we have not found cile steward, 
				  her mother, with the strength of God, voiced
				  her sorrow in a solemn attempt to make the 
				  world safer for other children in the future...
				  i dedicate whatever this might be to cece,
				  i demand that senate bill one be put into action...
				  i decline the silence for now and so have here said...
				  (for a second there i wish i had been the candy man
				  instead, separating the sorrow and collecting
				  all the cream, of course that entertainer was a card carrying 
				  member of the church of satan, not the deranged
				  seeing eye bitch hound in everything is illuminated)

				  <br>
				  i came to the end of villette and therein knew
				  i was right, the quoted passage was the peak,
				  in a sense, it foreshadows the possibly solitary
				  life to come after the sails encountered a storm...
				  i awoke very early - too early - i knew i had
				  not rested although surely i had slept a few 
				  hours...only a few, i always think of soraya on
				  this date...i raced through some likes on her
				  instagram as if to say hey - i didn;t really
				  enjoy f-1 the movie...i even thought, no wonder
				  apple tv is raising its price, the soundtrack alone
				  must have cost a fortune...and yet it fades out
				  with a mediocre ed sheerhan tune...let me not argue
				  about it - obviously some people like his thing...
				  my point is the shifting perspective used to film
				  the laps did not make sense to me...i also did not
				  like ferrari, but for contrast you can feel the 
				  quality is higher especially in the stranger killing
				  crash scene...anyway, we are behind the car, then 
				  in front of the car, but also sometimes on the side
				  of it...dizzying and if like me you are not a fan
				  of the sport - well...it makes it a struggle...
				  i regret to report, as i searched for what to 
				  read next, leaning into the tenant of wildfell hall,
				  so as to have experienced all three of the bronte 
				  sister's writing albeit i believe wuthering heights
				  to be the bee's knees, i thought of london rules,
				  which i excitedly read in vigil for the arrival of
				  a new season of slow horses...i thought if charlotte
				  were writing today this would be her type of romp,
				  hmm perhaps without the political commentary, herron
				  goes out of his way to have a giggle at trump's expense,
				  but there is hardly a mention of leaders in villette,
				  well napoleon as a point of reference or description...
				  in any case i have decided what to read next, although
				  i am most likely going to view einee meniee...in my
				  dream i was in the lobby of where i used to live
				  once upon a time, about to check the mail, i looked
				  at the key, it now had to be slid in sideways, as
				  opposed to straight in...as if to reflect my thoughts
				  before going to sleep - people i don't especially like
				  showed up - i awoke weirded out - who knows why this
				  happens and who knows why my thoughts turn to women 
				  once in recent while as if camping 
				  i am certain want nothing to do with me...like is it 
				  a message, or is it merely a mess? i scrambled eggs
				  and then started the day again near noon...it's 
				  an unusal day as did dishes and even cooked again,
				  yet i am waiting a while before settling into the
				  meal. oh yeah and the movie...
				  <br>
				  <br>
				  24/8/2025
				  <br>
				  so the movie, not terribly good, had, i felt, car
				  sequences that somehow surpassed the F-1 scenes...
				  still, i can only imagine they made that thinking
				  it would be some sort of shocking treat but the 
				  sad part is none of it stands the test of time,
				  (someone asked chatgpt to count to a million)
				  and i am writing this mere hours after watching it!
				  sure i remember and can recall it, but not in the
				  sweet way that happens when cinema rises to its
				  potential without gimmicks...(the ai refused,
				  several times) i want to express my admiration
				  for brad pitt so my previous thoughts are not
				  taken as a stance against him...this was jack
				  conrad, after all, not to mention being the
				  producer of mickey 17, anyway let's hang our
				  hopes on cliff booth...both my dreams were 
				  weird, i finally sort of met another gemma, 
				  well a third if we are counting ward, and
				  she, not the heir or the model, were in my
				  dream yet in some vague fashion i cannot pinpoint -
				  it crawled through the day, i remember standing in
				  the shower thinking, i am in arizona and nevada
				  and london somehow...helena called her chickens
				  baby dinosaurs...i was dealing with some other
				  woman in my dream, she was handing me paperwork
				  that needed to be filled out but then some disgruntled
				  man switched places with her and i stood at the counter
				  trying to ask about the last two forms...there were
				  paragraph length questions, i wanted to know where i 
				  was supposed to write the answers...i suppose this
				  was an improvement on the baffling situation with 
				  savannah...i liked her, i think she didnt like me
				  yet overwhelmed thought's vision as if it had all been
				  reversed within me - which might help to explain part
				  of yesterday;s note...it was getting hot as i awoke
				  today, there in the sauna type humid chamber which i 
				  cannot fathom since i long ago covered the windows
				  against the sun...so middle night get up feeling a
				  severe twist at left calf like a sprain or swimming
				  cramp...i sit up and it;s gone, i lay back down but
				  no longer feel like staying in bed possibly sensing
				  the mysteriously burning miasma...it's sunday, there
				  was a song being wroted in my head or at least the
				  repeated refrain of it insisting...years ago i wroted
				  'we are your limousine salesmen' it reminds me of that
				  of course someone removed those pages from songbook
				  as if now reflected in waking minutes - emily ann
				  roberts, i find, had to get her martin and video
				  letter the tune she was thinking of...flight to 
				  wisconsin...madison's a nice place, not as nice as
				  madison avenue yet that is to be expected, no surprise,
				  sunrise yet a few hours away as i speak to someone
				  in hong kong, maybe victoria; name of land, 
				  ceded to England by China in 1842, from the Chinese 
				  hiang kiang, meaning good water; after the english queen.
                  even in such a faraway, at such distances, i encounter
				  the sensation of posers intent on masking themselves
				  for the sabotage, making the entity in mission impossible
				  more likely than i would care to admit - is it others
				  i do not trust or myself...there is no answer, in the
				  proximity a headlighted car stands still at the corner
				  as if deciding which way to turn at these crossroads -
				  i catch a glimpse as i look out the window to question
				  the delay in my request for breeze - the weather is
				  getting cooler but it will never be winter here. 
				  Lucy, in the novel, is the only Snow i will encounter
				  for now.

				  26 august<br>
				  <br>
				  couldn't find a way to record correctly with video,
				  until i did, but my project idea is going to take
				  longer as now doing it twice means double the work
				  in terms of editing...oh yeah, i am simply trying
				  to get a few versions together for something...
				  it's tuesday at two in the morning - on monday i 
				  dreamt i was with julia - she was also in a magazine,
				  the magazine was rolled with a viriddescent tint as
				  if stained by grass on dream lawn...i can't say why
				  there is such ease with some people in these scenes,
				  like her...still i was looking at the magazine more
				  so than at her...when i awoke i found liberty had
				  visited a magazine shop...i didnt see liroe - 
				  i used the mustang and the kramer all in the same
				  reel - one take has a good enough sound and the
				  other has a nice enough angle, putting these together
				  is a task that worries me, so i have been putting it off -
				  i went to sleep early and awoke too soon for my taste -
				  i had been dreaming of emilee, maybe because i kept the
				  portrait up on my wall and it is partly visible in the
				  video, or maybe for no specific reason at all - it was
				  not our life, at least not one that either of us imagined;
				  we were living on a farm, in a farm house, and she asked me
				  to get her something yet as i went out i realized that i
				  had left my keys, it seems that in the dream knocking on 
				  the door was not an option - i had what she wanted and 
				  was surrounded by birds - i think now of how most birds 
				  are natural cannibals - in any case the bizarre part was
				  how the idea of living with her felt memorized, ritualized,
				  as if a fact in memory although recently i have only thought
				  of her at the sight of willow hand, i wake up with the 
				  heat strangling me, jump in the shower thinking of
				  romy mars, she had lightly pranked her roommate in a
				  lockout situation, as for the rest of the situation;
				  i survived the struggle to watch electrick children -
				  maybe i was rewatching it, can;t exactly count all the
				  movies i;ve seen...so i either liked it better this time
				  or i enjoyed it for the first time...hanging on the telephone
				  is as catchy as ego...still haven't selected what book to 
				  look into next...on a whim, i viewed the assignment, which
				  i know for certain i did see long ago but had no detailed
				  memory of - it's not an easy one to look at and perhaps 
				  more so now in the middle of mourning donald southerland -
				  i had lost track of aidan circa practical magic or more
				  likely songcatcher - good to see he has been constantly
				  at work with five projects upcoming and one series...
				  making my production concerns feel trivial...hate to 
				  see lars von trier's name kicked around the obituary
				  circuit, it was per holst and i suppose to attract 
				  more readers the press made the connection...my
				  point is the man has enough trouble without having
				  to now navigate against the casual curse of
				  words in print which might have made some people
				  think it was his headline instead of the producer. 
				  "The old cathedrals often have sublime artworks
				  hidden away in the darkest corners for only God to see. 
				  The same goes for murder..."

				  28/8
				  <br>
				  not much in terms of dreams...i chalk it up to 
				  overthinking...that film led me on to want to 
				  fiddle through a spy thriller...i selected the
				  fourth protocol, in an audio book i think is
				  an abridged version - i also think there is 
				  a film adaptation...in any case, it is pretty 
				  good...got halfway into it and didn't want to
				  to stop...i cannot say the same for mobland -
				  which i lined up to view then weighed the 
				  things to do...hopefully i can see that
				  down the line...i did take a moment to view
				  the deceiver which holds up shockingly well -
				  i don't mind nudity in cinema but i love it
				  when it could have obviously been used yet
				  isn't...like it implies a certain respect 
				  for the actors, specifically the actress -
				  (the lead plays a prostitute, you see_
				  well, as for my own video project, i have now
				  neared the finish line...if all goes well i 
				  can count it as a completion by tomorrow...
				  it took more work than i expected but i 
				  suppose that is the nature of it...
				  i am going ahead with the ending although
				  there was something in the box still in transit
				  that i wanted to employ therein...the last i 
				  heard it should arrive this weekend and be 
				  delivered some days after that...september.
				  the thought saddens me yet it is not such
				  a serious sorrow - i mean the haul will 
				  positively improve my spirits. she rides
				  shotgun thrilled me with its well paced
				  and mysterious start then further as it
				  took its twists and turns...indeed, one
				  i might not hesitate to watch again...
				  lovely surprise. ps, writer tries to 
				  order chinese food, they respond, we 
				  are out of fried rice, baffled - he 
				  settles for a sandwich...the next day
				  he tries again...we took beef fried
				  rice off the menu but you can order the
				  mixed fried rice with only beef...i 
				  ordered it...still baffled and maybe
				  even more now in writing it as the 
				  frivolity prevails over logic and i 
				  think it doesn't even make a good story!
				  my apologies for put-placing such 
				  a jigsaw puzzle in your hands, hopefully
				  i will make it up to you with some other
				  tidbit which requires no guessing
				  in the coming month.

				  two september
				  <br>
				  <br>
				  having finished my attempts at recording
				  nine versions of get behind the mule,
				  live and on video, with even a couple of 
				  takes i like very much, i turned down
				  two german films which were - well - they
				  were feeling out of place - and went 
				  straight into mobland...i actually could
				  not stop watching it, i kept thinking this
				  should have been two movies, maybe three -
				  so i watched it all except for the last
				  half hour to have the pleasure of waking
				  up to it as a sort of conclusion. so happy,
				  i went down that road. in my dreams i saw
				  pigeons on a city street - my thoughts 
				  convoluted and quick - i had started reading
				  the tenant of wildfell hall and maybe i was
				  trying to hard to process the information -
				  i don't think i've dreamt of rock doves
				  previously - i also don't think i have posted
				  a series without any notes...there was some 
				  sort of glitch and i had to re-post it and
				  so continued posting all nine without notes -
				  i suppose it's obvious but i had promised 
				  willow hand (who is featured in the eighth
				  version - actually the first one i taped
				  which served like a catalyst - cause i 
				  was tickled by her picture with a donkey -
				  near enough to a mule, i thought...
				  when a donkey gets it on with a mare;
				  mules are produced...or so i am told)
				  a credit in the form of mentioning it was
				  her...well, at least i am making it clear
				  here and might edit maybe or commentize it...
				  in my back to bed dream this morning i found
				  my cat was golden on one side and there was
				  another cat seemingly excited, feline erection
				  dream on keanu reeves' birthday...i had been
				  thinking of helena who said her cat is willy
				  and made an amazing road car video which 
				  made me think of amanda seyfried...you'll
				  know the refernce if you've seen twin peaks
				  the return...for some reason i was very excited
				  to hear that chloe grace moretz had tied the
				  proverbial knot...there was a pale blue dress
				  and i loved seeing her joy in it...
				  however my yesterday still went weird as i 
				  didn't get to new recordings, not even to 
				  guitar ritual...it was like i was overwhelmed
				  by my own thoughts in the whirlwind puzzle of
				  procrastination or more likely too much talk.
				  <br>
				  <br>
				  later that evening<br>
				  <br>
				  <br>
				  i suppose it is what i would call the variation
				  sessions...i was at ease with the song since
				  doing it daily as an improvisation...of course
				  once one hits the record button, with the knowledge
				  that it all has to be done in one take...well, let
				  us say most of them were not first takes, all the first
				  takes served to figure out the style (except for an 
				  unfilmed one wherein i wasn't thinking about it in
				  those terms - only to get a feel or confirm that i
				  was hearing myself right...)all i knew
				  was that there should be some difference between
				  each...the heat and humidity didn't help and i 
				  admit to some surprise at the end of each completion -
				  i am inclined to say i like the fifth version a bit
				  more than the others...for now...before that, as
				  i tried to recapture the planned progression in 
				  open F tuning on the martin acoustic, the high e string 
				  snapped - i mention this because later with ibanez
				  electric (in open G) the situation repeated itself...
				  i realized later that these two had become connected
				  in ways i didn't imagine, they were used to being
				  the only ones i used...and suddenly surrounded by
				  the new models it seems they collaborated to mirror
				  each other's protest...it led me to rearrange how
				  i kept them and put placed them together hoping that
				  it would help in the future...still, it underlines
				  the struggle of having several guitars as any of 
				  the axes might at one time or another feel neglected...
				  it's nothing i expected...like the new naked gun...
				  what a riot! it was beyond silly right down to the 
				  creadts, you don't need glasses! well, i do need
				  guesses about the two dreams i had, again in 3k,
				  therein at the living room - both times with an
				  ex girlfriend and her sister - once her memory 
				  flooded my thoughts but not the other...the way
				  to describe it would be sensible...we spoke calmly,
				  lovingly maybe, and in hushed tones - i can't say 
				  more because the content of the conversations 
				  drifted away leaving only the hint of itself. my 
				  only concern was that i sensed no emotional shift
				  within myself over them as if they were interchangeable -
				  i hope they are all right and wish them well -
				  after calculating and contrasting the price of pizza
				  and cake, i opted for cake and said thing arrived an
				  hour or so ago...i had some and shaved. anyway, the songs
				  were all recorded live during the period of 26 august
				  until 29 august with the exception of the one not filmed
				  from 20 august but also done live in a single take -
				  which felt no stage fright worry over a possible audience...
				  the sun was in virgo and once in a while i felt bathed
				  in that light. 
				  <br>
				  <br>
				  4.9.2025
				  <br>
				  the expected haul seems to have been re-delayed...they
				  said it would arrive friday, tomorrow, but that implies
				  another week's wait since those things need to be sorted,
				  put on trucks, and so on and so forth...
				  i was partly alarmed by the witch's torment as it held
				  an interesting concept yet insisted on playing out as
				  if it couldn't have been done in an hour or less -
				  for me, that meant skipping through it to its uneventful
				  ending...there was indeed more drama in the windows 
				  update...i'd seen the reports and noticed all the wild
				  discounts which in retrospect feel as if a planned revolution
				  to switch as much equipment as possible - with some hesitation
				  i went ahead and updated, confident in my snapdragon but
				  once the package downloaded the machine returned with that
				  message; ran into a problem and needs to restart...it said
				  they would restart it but i got jittery after some minutes
				  and pressed down on the power button feeling all the madness
				  that comes with possibly losing files one has even forgot
				  one had...as i waited i made a mental list of the novel
				  i thought was not backed up and the songs that only existed
				  therein, and who knows what else...funny huh, and i had just
				  started learning the chords to lennon's i'm losing you -
				  also therein shocked by the line "So what the hell am I supposed to do?
                   Just put a bandaid on it? And stop the bleeding now..."
				  which needless to say brought to mind the tragic 1980 scene
				  and suddenly my own situation with the laptop...anyway,
				  all that did pass, it started up and i paused updates...
				  with a plan to connect one of my storage units and transfer
				  as much as possible in case of anything similar down the line.
				  he repeats that line, stop the bleeding now...i thought it
				  must have crossed his mind as he lay shot down...
				  meanwhile i wasn't bleeding but the sweat felt like losing
				  part of myself upon the bed - two hours of dreamless sleep
				  only to awake to the wonder of it all - returning to 
				  dream, i find myself dressed as i was except with shirt
				  unbuttoned and running around trying to fetch a pen and
				  respond to the door all at the same time...i'm standing
				  there as if waiting to sign something...there are two men
				  at the gate, they look as if one man that has grown a
				  second head on top of his natural skull...they are dark,
				  unfriendly, and i cannot recognize them...i wake up again
				  thankful that at least i had another hour of sleep - 
				  i recorded an instrumental song yesterday and no one
				  knocked upon my door - except for a meal delivery -
				  the day was cooler yet the apartment kept it;s steamy
				  stance...i thought about helena's voice message before
				  going to sleep...i think it is incorrect to leave school
				  in order to be more of a fashion model...but that is
				  only a suspicion as i have no insight...when i got up 
				  it was eight thirty i didn't have any dream recall.

				  five september<br>
				  <br>
				  <br>
				  my point was that she could exploit herself in 
				  terms of becoming a social media influencer slash
				  model instead of paying an agency to exploit her
				  by passing her portfolio along for adverts...
				  the education part is debatable...
				  i watched dynamite, a film i had superimposed 
				  in part - the party scene - upon one of the get
				  behind the mule takes...it was way more intense
				  than i could have imagined...but as a sort of 
				  spoiler warning, skip this one if you are a 
				  bird lover...julia faye was in it like she was
				  in a lot of cecil b demille films...i didn't
				  make a movie yesterday, but julia mecey was
				  in my dream...we were sitting next to each other
				  at the frame of an open door, i felt dumb for
				  not knowing the architectual terminology of
				  a rounded door...it was very much like the 
				  door in rome when i met carmen from romania
				  and took her picture...suddenly marie anne
				  was sitting opposite us...none of us were 
				  speaking as if we understood one another
				  by simply being there - i woke up for a moment
				  then, i had been looking at her ring...studying
				  it to find a talk show host engraved on one side -
				  it must have been the middle of the night when
				  my next dream presented masha which is spelled
				  like mawa but is a nickname for maria, i say 
				  masha to distinguish from aria and neverova -
				  masha had been on my mind through the day as 
				  she reminds me of someone i can't place - or 
				  perhaps it is merely someone from a past life -
				  in the dream i am still audience and she is
				  decked out in heels and a cat print bikini -
				  she is swaying more than dancing but i can't
				  make sense of the dream and awake a bit baffled
				  like maybe this scene was intended for someone
				  else -it's still dark yet the day is coming
				  fast - i have some cake along with the coffee
				  and get in a chapter of the tenant of wildfell
				  hall...i steal away for a nap before the sun 
				  gets any higher into the sky - in the sugar
				  filled dreamscape i am on a sofa facing a tv
				  and there is a girl there with me...i brush away
				  remnants of clingy socks from her toes...like
				  always there is nothing on the tv, i play with her
				  breast and try for one of the music stations - i
				  am surprised - it wasn't like before as all the 
				  music channels are labeled by country yet no 
				  matter the nation there is an ozzy osbourne song
				  blasting out on each...i lower the volume and
				  realize three women from my family are arriving -
				  i guess it was lotta or sierra - i'm really not
				  sure as i have not televisioned since mother 
				  was here a year or so ago - she tells me to get
				  her my sister's phone number - i stand in front
				  of my sister in the dream and notice a spider web
				  tattoo on her right eyelid...she says she can't
				  remember that number number and vanishes while i
				  now face a closet of my onw clothes - sierra or
				  lotta says something about the spider web design -
				  i sense mother and aunt but i can't see them, then
				  start to doubt that it was my sister...it would 
				  necessarily take a larger face for that design,
				  maybe it was all a masquerade or the dream of
				  a couch potato somewhere - i don't know but i did
				  play i'm losing you again a couple of times and
				  even took a minute to feel the vocal, that is mine
				  in contrast to lennon...i suspect i will only have
				  trouble with the chorus which goes a bit against
				  the grain as if to plead lighter than the argumentative
				  verses in four syllables that sometimes sound like three -
				  not that i actually know how i will do it in the end,
				  but i wanted get learnt on how he did it.
				  <br>
				  <br>
				  six september<br>
				  <br>
				  <br>
				  someone is speaking to me in a dream, i do not
				  know or recognize who it might be...it seems we
				  are in a lobby or shop...something street-level
				  since after talking i find myself on the avenue...
				  i am shown pepperidge farm chessmen cookies - 
				  there is writing upon the package more like a 
				  letter or note than ingredients...i actually
				  have one in the pantry yet i had overdosed on
				  these sweets and it's been there a couple of months
				  now - the font is a light script - easy enough to 
				  read yet i don't recall what it said - upon waking
				  i find myself thinking of astrid, i had just learnt
				  she was in lisbon when the following day told of 
				  a streetcar all the press called a funicular for
				  some reason...she has two pictures are i admire -
				  i was relieved to see her post a new photo as it
				  then stood to reason that she was more or less in
				  safety - in the dream, i saunter and spot a man
				  i do recognize although i have not met him - i 
				  suppose he reminds me of the jamaican in the 
				  exchange loft with the slide out key as a transaction
				  counter - for some reason in the scene he is having a
				  sale, the dime bag comes with some sort of hallucinogenic
				  side-kick, twisted roots in licorish color resembling 
				  peppermint christmas candy sticks or canes in surreal
				  or abstract miniature and also encased within the 
				  common jewelry zip bag...i am eager and receive a
				  ten from my twenty disappointed at the nnumber of
				  visible seeds well at least they are visible and
				  not embedded into the bud like a surprise in a 
				  cracker jack box...i walk away and awake - it's
				  seven in the morning, i'm nearing the mid-way 
				  mark of the tenant of wildfell hall...i will
				  carry on with it as the start of my day, then 
				  mix the new recording i did yesterday before
				  guitar ritual when i again strummed through
				  the aforementioned song yet did not sing it
				  for the smoke filled room and upset stomach...
				  i had viewed unknown number the high school
				  catfish, which proves frailty thy name is
				  woman might yet hold ground, hail willy shakes -
				  and i reluctantly added it to the list of 
				  films about writers...what i disliked the 
				  most was how miss licari reminded me of miss
				  mcderby from grade school... who left me
				  a cherished remembrance...
				  ps, for reasons unexplained
				  i created wordstar.straw.page

				  8.9.2025
				  <br>
				  <br>
				  in a dream i am strumming a guitar - 
				  sliding down from an a suspended chord
				  on the second fret to other chords
				  between the fifth and seventh...
				  the day did not seduce much activity,
				  i tried to watch something called
				  what we hide, but i was interrupted
				  by an amazon delivery - the driver
				  calling from another building down
				  the road and the call itself making
				  a passing street vendor sound in 
				  stereo - sounds really do sway
				  emotion or have the potential to 
				  do so...i left the movie, my state
				  of mind more to blame than the drama -
				  in another dream, a woman has moved in
				  and is being very gentle with me as if
				  intent on staying, i;m not sure who she 
				  is and she didn't remind me of anyone
				  after i awoke...i was telling her that 
				  i had cake and left over chinese food
				  and it was all in the fridge - of course
				  there hasnt really been left over take
				  out since hunan garden...i don't recall
				  exactly yet i believe the dream was not
				  in english...i keep seeing these laptops
				  on sale and started seriously considering
				  getting on...no easy choice...we all know
				  there will be new models in a few months -
				  what if they are merely clearing stock - 
				  i tested the items that arrived, everything
				  seemed fine - although i still feel marantz
				  owes me refund...before resloving itself -
				  anne switches narration to the female lead
				  and it's the very definition of open up 
				  the safe; bitches have a lot to say...
				  the writing isnt bad, although it gets
				  a bit too religious, but it is as if 
				  she is knitting and making her readers
				  explore the process of stitching her
				  protagonist's tale until one feels drunk 
				  or dizzy - i suppose that implies that
				  between charlotte and emily she was the
				  lesser scribe...of course one could equally
				  argue that it was a forerunner of psychological
				  novels...if she were here, i would put place it
				  thisaway; you missed all levity like a band
				  playing straight ballads for hours, very little
				  here inspires affection for any the characters
				  when the tempo is downright sour...a third of it
				  done, but i doubt there will be any humor on the
				  horizon...well as hunter thompson said; pay the
				  ticket, take the ride.

				  9.9.2025
				  <BR>
				  <BR>
				  i got up early, and returned myself to sleep,
				  thinking surely i did not get enough rest - 
				  caitlin, who left new york for los angeles
				  spoke of ovulation...it reminded of a slippery
				  dream i missed jotting, sitting in a bath with
				  a woman...i don't think it was her - and seeing
				  blood rise...then searching her to see if she
				  was bleeding...maybe it was about the blood moon -
				  term of eclipse...a good reason to be a thief
				  is to steal sky - now this is the third mention
				  of shotgun, which i find weird or interesting -
				  in another dream, there is a man in a trench 
				  coat, unlike the flood dream or the film - 
				  in fact sort of like kyle maclachlan, he is 
				  holding the weapon and looking none too happy.
				  i remember waking up and thinking of the other
				  side of dale cooper...gee he was good in that.
				  too good. as i drifted into dreams this mid-morning
				  i found myself dressed in a suit explaining to 
				  a man that i had a hankerchief, he tried to 
				  beat me by producing a second one from his lapel
				  pocket side...but i had one in my own and he turned
				  as if defeated, i patted him on the back...thinking
				  of keaton, neither buster nor dianne but michael -
				  although as confusing as it is, douglas...film 
				  idea the two michael douglases - back in the series
				  kyle also played a doug...it all comes around somehow -
				  anyway there is a line, crowded, it feels we are all
				  enetering a court house - a heavy set judge leans over
				  the entrance - there is a pretty prosecutor and she is 
				  trying to flirt with him, it is all in a language i 
				  can't understand - she tries again after glancing at
				  me, saying a word that sounds like mint - but he scoffs
				  as if correcting her, mont...i wake up thinking she
				  doesnt have a chance with her case. i suppose the 
				  only thing to do now is to listen to jackson browne's
				  lawyers in love along with queen's don't stop me now
				  for it being inka's birthday and it was through her
				  i found that song. 
				  <br>
				  <br>
				  ten september<br>
				  <br>
				  <br>
				  i'd gone to sleep thinking of julia...well two
				  julias...one had spoken of naps with a near 
				  political enthusiasm...the other i had seen
				  in weapons...a modern classic that defies
				  category and somehow transcends itself...
				  one of the few times where hype is not only
				  justified, but on some level even lacking. 
				  well, let me leave it there as i would be
				  tempted to go into spoilers by continuation -
				  all the while, yesterday and today, that is
				  i had been intent on avoiding the mention 
				  of the girl on the train that was unalived
				  as the post-modern expression now says -
				  but forgive me my lack of restraint as
				  i was nearing the point of perfect silence,
				  i mean why speak - what could one say!
				  i was confronted by reports of an even
				  more intense tragedy...she was stabbed
				  in the neck, he was shot in the neck!
				  orem, utah...charlottte, north carolina...
				  iryna was as quiet as mouse, but the silence
				  of the passangers near her was deafening...
				  i wasn't sure what shocked me more - anyway,
				  charlie was not quiet, on the contrary, 
				  he took a stance and it seems to have cost
				  his life...i was sure of the shock in his
				  case, as i watched the twitch and slump
				  of his being when the bullet struck flesh
				  and blood poured out into social media...
				  everything said or nothing to say - both
				  equalized by death...so i jot the note,
				  horrified for his wife and children...
				  hoping they never see my careless words. 
				  i should have been thinking about doris,
				  another birthday girl...but where was the time?
				  i had cake for breakfast along with honey don't -
				  two great films in row, yes it is possible - 
				  i had a complaint maybe a couple , but
				  hats off to ethan, that was fine cinema. 
				  i had expected to spend the afternoon
				  concerned with the girls visiting new york
				  for fashion week, at least the ones i 'knew' -
				  yet that breaking news left no room to escape -
				  nepal and france lost any hope for international
				  attention, nevermind gaza israel or poland
				  ukraine russia...i saw one woman say he 
				  was 'stabilized" then the reports confirmed
				  his passing...as of this writing, the shooter
				  is at large...another woman had posted herself
				  naked with her georgia state id exposed upon
				  her belly - indeed i've seen too much this week,
				  maybe we all, collectively, have. in the late
				  afternoon, i roamed back into my dream...well,
				  it wasn't a dream - it couldn't have been since
				  i saw helena flesh it out in a post as if anticipated
				  or in some weird synchronicity...i;d seen her 
				  on a bed, topless, and could sort of hear her
				  voice - it all surprised me since i seemed to be
				  standing there watching and it is not in my
				  dream nature to encounter women half undressed,
				  still the surprise grew as i came across her 
				  new pictures, some shoot wherein she was not 
				  so exposed yet wearing only lingerie...i have 
				  had psychic dreams once in a while, but i can't
				  put place this in that category which is why i
				  wroted that it wasn't a dream...something else.
				  in the early evening i wanted to eat something
				  else and ordered kfc simultaneously intent on
				  viewing dracula a love story - it took an hour
				  and i had started to regret my choice in selecting
				  that so called combo meal...but the film was
				  so delicious, was such a treat, i am tempted to
				  term it divine. two hours and ten minutes of
				  rapture and delight. i am not a scholar of the
				  dracula genre, but i have seen most of them 
				  with the exception of last year's nosferato
				  by mister eggers - and so there was a sweet 
				  ping pong game between 1922 and 1979 and 1992
				  especially in my mind like time travel hop
				  as the scenes surrounded me...it's one of the
				  few times i applauded when the credits rolled. 
				  i fully intend to watch all these films again.
				  as for the violent incidents irl, well i would
				  be foolish to wish for no more of them knowing
				  full well that in one case, the now nearly 
				  hushed knock out game could graduate into
				  a stabbing sensation while in the other case,
				  political assassinations are de facto or nearly
				  part of the playbook...i've seen none yet
				  have heard some left-wingers or liberals were cheering and or
				  celebrating, indeed even before today there
				  was a vocal desire expecting the demise of trump. 
                  i noticed the many press releases mixing in the
				  president's name with an alarming nonchalance...
				  on the other hand, unity such as this has not
				  been seen since the death of ozzy osbourne...
				  ( i would like to underline the further irony
				  of the netflix royal visiting england as then
				  some claim sisson was deleting anti-kirk posts,
				  trekkies have yet to weigh in and being team
				  shatner i hope they do so soon...)

				  i did not retain any dream memory from last night.
				  before then, i dreamt of waiting outside with a 
				  cousin...seemed to be new york, a parking garage,
				  the vehicle a sports car, low to the ground...fancy,
				  i cou;dnt understand it - yet it reminded me of a 
				  party i went to one time and that late night i was
				  asked if i could drive, saying yes without actually
				  knowing how to handle a vehicle, i was given keys
				  and told to take the wheels into a similar garage.
				  somehow, it all worked out...what didn't work out
				  for me was anne bronte - the final influx of the
				  aunt had my hysterical...it must be the longest
				  epistle style tome in history and i felt the 
				  heaviness of time within it...sure the writing
				  once in a while is poetic enough, but i really
				  started to dislike it when helen returns to her
				  husband in the role of caretaker...there is no 
				  logic to establish that as reasonable...
				  well, at least now i have "met" all three bronte
				  sisters...anyway, from the many raves involving
				  dracula a love story, i learned there was one
				  vampire film i had missed, dracula untold - quickly
				  viewing the trailer, i didn't feel i had missed 
				  anuthing relevant to this - it is a real alternate
				  take with minimal influence from bram stoker - 
				  hopefully i can catch it somewhere down the line -
				  i awoke with heavy thoughts about weapons - 
				  with worry about arriving deliveries and if i had
				  slept too late - it was well before nine in the 
				  morning so it was all right...although as it 
				  nears noon i see i could have squeezed in a 
				  few more minutes of rest - instead, i finsihed
				  mastering and acoustic version of bookmaker's
				  stake (song about the shooting of catholics
				  in ireland and saint agatha) and in making 
				  the new art work i then proceeded to remix
				  the electric version and re-named it bookmaker's shop,
				  suspecting that is how sean graham's place was called -
				  obviously the recent news brought this tune to mind...
				  not to mention the now overlooked evergreen colorado 
				  incident...
				  well, both are set for release...hopefully, soon.
				  as i type the tyler robinson news breaks...not 
				  so good for the foundation...i notice it is not the
				  usual three names and for some reason i like that
				  it is not the usual as this was no usual assassination.
				  there is a resemblance to one of the colombine shooters
				  if memory serves...(took a glance, indeed eric harris
				  looks a nit like tyler robinson, ps the foundation's 
				  address might be noted: 11700 W Charleston Blvd #170-57,
				  Las Vegas, NV 89135...my apologies for the spelling, it
				  was not intentional..

Put it in your pantry with your cupcakes

				  <br>
				  <br>
				  in a dream i'm riding on of those sand vehicles -
				  i'm not sure what they are called, sort of like
				  a four wheeler yet with room for two...i was
				  standing on what must have been the passenger side,
				  like in a western when horses enter a new town -
				  i don't recognize the city - it is crowded with
				  one story structures and some duplexes - i 
				  see sierra levesque walking as i get nearer to
				  the streets - then i am walking, i hear someone
				  shout something, like a cat call yet more of
				  an insult, i see it's directed at julia - she
				  is sitting in a cafe very obviously immersed
				  in some fashion of study - she responds that
				  they should mind their own business but i as
				  my steps bring me close to her i see that she
				  has sort of frozen maybe in midsentence, sitting
				  there with her mouth open as if time had stopped -
				  i suppose i have some knowledge that it is a dream
				  and instead of being concerned i am only happy to
				  have seen her - her hair seemed a touch shorter...
				  in any case, either yesterday or today, is when 
				  sierra released her first album...i reckon by 
				  making a note of it i am wishing her well -
				  i had gone to bed early without successfully
				  falling asleed until later and awoke a few
				  moments before five in the morning - i took advantage
				  of the the cool quiet air to sweep the hall, living
				  room, and kitchen...then i watered the plants - 
				  after feeding skirt and scrolling aimlessy through
				  social media, i went back to bed feeling it was yet
				  too early to start the day as it were - in my nap
				  dream, i was carrying one of my laptops into what
				  seemed to be an office, an office where mother
				  was working...but somehow the scene brought to mind
				  aunt's house - in any case, i'm at a desk surrounded
				  by other desks and people seemingly at work - 
				  my laptop is slow and i start to worry that i should
				  not have connected it to that network and soon enough
				  shut it off - as i do i look under the desk and find 
				  several usb sticks connected to each other, i pull
				  them out thinking to find out what data they hold or
				  if the place was set up to transfer files from my 
				  own files..i think i speak to mother before leaving -
				  suddenly finding myself in another room with two 
				  women - one of them has pants, that is she is offering
				  me pants...she says she can get my size by pressing
				  an incredibly large pair against my legs, no not
				  large they were humungous - she judges the contrast,
				  and looking at her trying to handle the giant slacks
				  i say, so a former first lady has nothing better to 
				  do than trade in fucking elephant pants, i repeat
				  then looking at the other girl, fucking elephant pants-
				  i awake realizing that in the dream i did not even
				  weigh the possible synonyms...colossal, massive, immense,
				  megalithic, astronomical, gargantuan...all a touch
				  nicer than fucking elephant pants, although elephantine
				  could or should have been more polite - in any case,
				  the easier huge, big, and oversize simply don't tell
				  the story...i mean - stretched out - they exceeded
				  the queen mattress in terms of length...it was about
				  nine then and i knew it was time for more coffee. 
				  ps, a working version of our new fashion word processor
				  is now up @ inkrealm.info/runway

				  sunday 14 september 20225
				  <br>
				  <br>
				  the new app met some evolution and addition -
				  i surprised myself with this one as i believe
				  it is the first interchangeable video background
				  text area...i had spent a day nearly lovely -
				  otherwise, except i did not get to as much
				  guitar as i would have liked...i kept thinking 
				  of how unusual it was dream to of disguising
				  a request - at some shop asking for tobacco
				  paper instead of the usual name i would employ -
				  even more unusual was thinking of harris, who
				  i neither like, respect, nor expect anything 
				  but lies from...being in that other scene -
				  perhaps it was the pure shock of a once reliable
				  publication, the atlantic, printing her as if 
				  chaos does indeed reign...in the afternoon
				  martha made mention of one of her earlier
				  films, i motioned to view it and did so -
				  baba yaga : terror of the dark forest...
				  enjoying very much yet disgruntled with
				  her limited appearance and demise within it. 
				  the situation led me to peek into 90263,
				  the wordstar.nexus page dedicated to her - 
				  i decided to start planning an update yet
				  have not brought myself to it...i do hope
				  to find some way of improving it...presently
				  in the middle of an errol flynn flick - 
				  edge of darkness, 1943...both films made
				  me think of lynch, i mean in terms of darkness,
				  where i got my idea about it from - as excited
				  as i was to see the bowie archives available
				  (https://www.vam.ac.uk/info/david-bowie-centre-faqs)
				  i was at the opposite sensation of a thrill 
				  experiencing the sale of lynch's home - 
				  how cool would it have been to museum while
				  having kept the already auctioned items...
				  i imagined the demonstration in england
				  in terms of protesting that as well as 
				  immigration...anyway, i don't know about
				  you but the next time they start speaking
				  of the blood moon i am going into hiding - 
				  what a fucking week! myself feeling bargained
				  for as i rose this morning...mouth partly open,
				  salivating, drooling on the right side...
				  i didn't recall the dream except for talk of
				  ontario - a place in canada i have not yet 
				  visited - i was concerned over being put placed
				  in a trance or even wondered if i was suffering
				  from some malaise - i am not intimate with hypochondria
				  but every once in a while i undress before it knowing
				  that each concern could further be complicated - 
				  at the expectation of a new machine i finally 
				  put in a couple of apps on my second laptop...it
				  felt good like having enough options on it now instead
				  of merely the music apps...in any case, i ate cake
				  and much later a sandwich with chips. the weather
				  has been cooling but the apartment is yet holding 
				  on to a mystery hotness...i noticed liam had
				  a follow up sequel titled ice road : vengeance
				  and i was pretty satisfied with my choice in 
				  avoiding hesitation - getting right into it
				  i found it stars fan binbin as well as introducing
				  grace o'sullivan - now reminding me of ann sheridan -
				  'we must be like steel' - yes i know the reviews
				  are not good but i thought it was cool and i was
				  entertained the whole while. meanwhile the 1943
				  is interesting enough, two thousand in the norway
				  reistance lost their lives between 1940 -45,
				  in 2018 Prime Minister Erna Solberg said the 
				  country was sorry - in terms of 'german-girls';
				  "Up to 50,000 Norwegian women are thought to have 
				  had intimate relationships with German soldiers.
				  The Germans were also encouraged to have children 
				  with them by SS leader Heinrich Himmler..." those
				  women were mistreated after the war for the obvious
				  reasons...well, i suppose it is time to gif some
				  frames of that film and include it in the film 
				  list inkrealm.info/1991
				  <br>
				  <br>
				  15 september
				  <br>
				  <br>
				  i did not get to sleep until late, much later than
				  i expected - at about ten in the morning, i was 
				  woken by an interruption of electricity - it
				  feels very specific when the fan is all one has
				  to keep from sweating...there's a steamy feeling,
				  a sensation of the worst sauna in the world intent
				  on making one lose one's patience - so the lights
				  were out, i remember going to bed as lotta ended
				  her day and helena started her own - there were
				  no dreams and hardly any thoughts except i wondered
				  how the amazon carrier would get through without
				  phone or internet - before i could think too much,
				  the street vendors seemed to take advantage of
				  the opportunity, as if multiplying exactly at
				  that time - i drank cold coffee and had cigarettes
				  cursing the circumstance - it's like being screamed
				  at from the street again and again so that even if
				  like me you reach for reading material - in this
				  case empire v by victor pelevin, for pondering
				  that it would fit in nicely on the heels of dracula
				  a love story, and get 120 pages you still have more
				  recall of the distraction - in any case, after a few
				  chapters i stopped worrying that pelevin would crowd
				  the prose with his multitude of variations and found
				  it to be pretty straightforward - so it should not be
				  a task to tackle the rest of it and finish it soon - 
				  yet the day was lost, it was lost as soon as the lighte
				  went out and the yelling started - the delivery never
				  alerted or showed in any case as if the whole thing
				  was pre-planned and packaged...i noticed as the electricity
				  returned moments after two in the afternoon - 
				  later with take out, i tried to watch playgirls of
				  frankurt and it sure had some quality but i was
				  not in the mood for it - i opted for truer noir,
				  1949's "impact"...or if you think your wife is awful
				  take a look at this woman - sure it has a glitch or
				  two yet i was in its chokehold all the way. 
				  <br>
				  <br>
				  18 September 
				  <br>
				  <br>
				  im not much for thumb typing on my cell,
				  by way of explaining this "style"...
				  the windows update failed, corrupting
				  bitlocker thing and wiping restore points,
				  in the middle of a reinstall now...
				  i was watching relay, not bad but he
				  should have known when they had her phone...
				  spent the last couple of days reimagining
				  and redesigning the main inkrealm.info
				  page, satisfied with results...more so
				  since the haul arrived...i love the jackery
				  knowing that power outages will not be
				  as problematic, i adore the banker guitar
				  picks, excellent - as for the new telecaster 
				  well, i feel as i did with the mustang so
				  there is hope that i will come to terms with it...
				  hmm i watched americana, but i am reluctant to
				  commentize...i am nearing the end of 'rope of
				  sand' which is pretty unusual - the novel, empire
				  v is not holding up in the middle section - it's 
				  like it has too much to explain so it starts feeling
				  like a lecture instead of literature but not so
				  awful...i looked at pictures of munich from
				  the 30s in contrast to present day...spme views
				  are so similar it was thrilling, in a historical 
				  sense, naomi carman was playing live and i caught 
				  a few minutes - such a good voice and so beautiful!
				  nothing else to note, not even dreams...uhm there
				  was a scene with natalia but i felt it was manipulated
				  although maybe it was due to her artwork being yet
				  upon my walls...when waking i noticed that scanning
				  sensation retracing the time i asked her for it...
				  so i chalked it up to spying...spyvgames was a redford
				  film and of course he was on my mind these last few
				  days...it was a rainy day and i am enjoying the aftermath 
				  which brings a near chill to the night's air...i can't 
				  deny my anxiety over the reinstallation and i am not
				  happy over having to put place all the apps into the
				  system but i am hopeful it will all work out.
				  <br>
				  <br>
				  19spetember
				  <br>
				  <br>
				  i hope nobody encounters such a situation - well,
				  let me preface by saying that the situation was
				  resolved - however, for some reason the reinstall
				  removed all wireless connections - when doing so,
				  you get directed to a aka.ms/dotnet/app-launch-failed
				  and so the first lesson is obviously to have another
				  way at hand to access the internet - and a usb with
				  enough space for a few items such as  'Microsoft.AspNetCore.App'
				  and intel wifi drivers - et cetera (in my case things
				  were complicated by the fact that samsung asked
				  to scan my galaxy book but of course it was offline )
				  anyway after trying the turn off and on router and
				  even ridiculously moving the laptop near the modem -
				  i came across the first part of the solution,
				  “OOBE\BYPASSNRO” which one types in at the pop
				  screen from shift key + F10 (word to the wise, that
				  particular screen needs to be "activated" and this is
				  done by "tapping" on the screen and praying to an obscure
				  roman deity) well, i proceeded to bring in the network
				  drivers from intel and appscore thing but nothing - 
				  still a puzzle...it was solved finally and honestly still
				  mysteriously by goinf back into the manage devices, 
				  wherein i looked past the network connections upon
				  seeing some samsung thingy that was highlighted as if
				  needing to be updated - in a second there it was - the
				  wifi option! i hope this saves someone that encounters
				  such a raw deal...i waited for today to rinstall apps
				  but i did take a minute to delete as much microsoft 
				  bloatware as possible and turning off the updates
				  ...while finishing rope of sand
				  and making a second video for the inkrealm.info
				  background...not being as tall as the previous video
				  it left a space which i filled up with dick tracy,
				  so catch that one if you can while its there...
				  i went to sleep and had some sort of erotic dream,
				  well maybe romantic but i always think it is erotic
				  when there is nakedness...not sure, i know i awoke
				  soon after thinking of how the vampires told each other
				  to always pay for sex reasoning that there is no such
				  thing as free cheese...uhm that's from empire v - 
				  and i went right back to sleep then in a dreamless
				  slumber - getting uo in the late morning, intent
				  on setting things right with the snapdragon -
				  i sensed and even saw kitty ( a model that
				  keeps a set of dolls as her family) yet i could not
				  explain the quasi paranormal sensations although
				  that other movie, the burt lancaster one, his character 
				  was mike davis...just like a history teacher i knew...
				  it was from him that i first learned about astral projection -
				  and perhaps in some sort of alchemist magic, there was
				  a meeting in some some sort of grey spiritual area that
				  would otherwise be inexplicable...anyway at this point
				  it's now early evening - i am torn between cleaning up
				  some or going through the scale ritual on guitar...
				  i had been playing the mustang and then the new telecaster
				  again leaving them both out as if saying to myself they
				  were not that different except for tone...i mean that
				  in a good way. 
				  <br>
				  <br>
				  21september2025
				  <br>
				  <br>
				  as if i didn't get enough windows action, i opted
				  to reset the other laptop, mostly to purge my system
				  from onedrive - this was easier yet took a much longer
				  time after the reinstall there was a bit of weirdness
				  with fl studio, i had reverted back to an earlier
				  model, baffled by their snippets of sounds and new
				  set up - but some plugins werent loading until they
				  did - i even managed to free myself from the browser
				  popup information of "what's new" although later
				  it still came up in the form of html code in txt 
				  within notepad...you can't always get what you want...
				  i watched swipe, which was much more than i expected -
				  even cool, in a feminist sense...but then american sweatshop
				  was not what i expected, like they wanted to torture
				  the audience with awful images or hints of them...
				  for some reason i kept thinking of gemma, not my
				  gemmma, and not the Ai model, but the going to 
				  college waitress that once in a while rants about
				  the restaurant on social media...i'm not sure what
				  this means, like the monkey flag but it was casual...
				  i got to the conclusion of empire v, i can nearly
				  say for certain that i did not like the middle part -
				  and by the time the protagonist goes in for a duel
				  - well, i was at a loss for logic - anyway the actual
				  poetic battle wasn't bad but i had a hell of a time
				  understaing how he survived even if the resolution
				  was perfectly clear...i ventured to imagine that
				  there are truths in it which cannot be told and 
				  so the narrative becomes riddled by necessity - 
				  but maybe it is that that particular author had
				  already at that point overdone it in terms of
				  previous books - in any case i actually preferd
				  this style to generation p although gp is a lot
				  more fun albeit convoluted or crowded with concepts.
				  speaking of generation, the lights went out and i 
				  had my first shot at the jackery in an actual
				  situation plugging in a lamp and fan and playing
				  losing games of chess as the vst search function
				  did its thing. it felt like being in a space
				  ship drifting into the far reaches of the outer
				  realms...the feeling of power and freedom - and
				  as the lights came back the satori of wow what
				  a missed opportunity that was in empire v with
				  smells like teen spirit line albino libido mosquito
				  although i myself had no exact theory for how
				  it might be inserted or alluded to...ps, bablos -
				  in english bab is like saying babe but in russia
				  bab is like saying granny - however, the nearest
				  word in not so common use is byblos - an eatery
				  that might be found in toronto, bondi, mykonos,
				  and miami. in other words i will prolly not find
				  someone that might illuminate my questions about
				  this novel. please note how the climax reflected
				  my staring at the windows reinstallations!

				  <br>
				  dostoyevsky = sixteen novels, seventeen short stories...
				  pelevin = nineteen books and counting...
				  bulgakov...five novels. 
				  i'm not suggesting any write less, it was merely
				  a passing thought within i also judge myself...
				  in contrast - although i slept soundly, after
				  eating i felt as drowsy as any drugged man and
				  nested upon the bed again sleeping as if it were
				  the only thing to do...my thoughts blurred in
				  trying to solve the snoozing sensation - leni 
				  klum was there as i wondred why i had been dreaming
				  about a dirndl before, florence pough was there
				  as i tried to distinguish the scenes from the 
				  film lady macbeth as opposed to the lady macbeth of the mtsensk district
				  which i had just read - i drifted away no wiser - dreaming
				  of wood ladders and metallic ladders - it's only
				  five degrees cooler on my desk than it is in ninety degree siberia 
				  but it will get colder there - here not so much -
				  it's my first time reading leskov, "I prefer to build a
				  story upon a real fact, not fiction..." and i hope it
				  is not my last. tackle box, tail bone, tiny toy car...
				  because i thought about it, i went back to apartment 7A.
				  yet i paused it to see the fantastic four first steps
				  which i thought would be fluff yet it was a magic act
				  in the sense that it presented a sort of 1950s vibe
				  right alongside space travel...enchanting, even the
				  credits were extremely well done i admit, it even made
				  me emotional - in a dream in some backstage hallway
				  an impossible crowd of women in slik surround me
				  and i kept holding my arms stretched out straight
				  and still so as not to have them think my movement 
				  was intent on touching...in another dream i am 
				  dressed in a burgundy striped tee and then wearing
				  the same pattern shirt...i was arguing with someone
				  that claimed someone else was my pal, i don't have
				  any fucking friends, i said - there was an avenue and a suitcase
				  and i kept crossing back and forth as if checking in
				  for a flight at some airport that was still under construction -
				  i cleaned up my room and attempted to organize for creativity.
				  currently, i have come across an unsually cool chord progession,
				  i have also started on a tinsel town ghost story for the 
				  purpose of recounting the history of the land until the 1920s...
				  the thought that i have never seen a native of los angeles
				  california struck me as weird...i suppose in getting back
				  to writing, yes i don't consider these notes literature, for
				  the most part; i naturally pondered over opening lines -
				  Jake felt puzzled at the obese family standing before him
				 and insisting they needed his money with urgency. He would
				  not have given weight a second thought, had it been a
				  wealthy yet skinny clan. In fact, most of the rich people
				  he knew - for unclarified reasons, were thin. He tried to
				  count the poor fat people but he couldn't get past the irony.
				  He gazed at Julia, his secretary, musing over her body structure which
				  had always been scrawny but now was being fleshed out in
				  curvy ways by some gymnasium she visited before arriving
				  at work. He felt, the pounds made her less attractive yet
				  nowhere as downright ugly as the blubber crowd requesting
				  a loan at his desk...

				  one kingdom was called iOS, and its capital was the Home Screen, 
				  a grid of squares and circles that glowed with the soft luminescence of the night...
				  nah i haven't beem on my iphone so much, it's merely to introduce our
				  app available exclusively for the other kingdom, android...
				  <a href="https://github.com/ghostm68/eg/raw/refs/heads/main/inkrealm.apk" download>www.inkrealm.info</a>
				  once you allow it, in some cases a scan is available, and install it
				  there are no permissions needed and it will auto-update anytime
				  the domain is edited...basically a mirror of the main page with 
				  the links opening in your chosen browser....the app-icon is;
				  
				  <img width="333" height="333" src="https://github.com/ghostm68/pantheon/raw/main/app-icon.jpg"><br>
				  that is also the detail which took days to get right...so yeah there
				  was a lot of coding by which i mean mostly guess work and vibe coding...
				  by way of explaining my absence...also due partly to expecting a delivery
				  which somehow met with delay and is yet to arrive...i stayed up all night
				  for the set day only to find myself still waiting...in the meanwhile, 
				  i viewed apartment 7A a few more times...it coincided with a new interview
				  and since i was in a creative state of mind this was the result; 
				  https://inkrealm.info/apartment7A  (i also had apartment 7g going as a 
				  playground) now mostly done save for links and a splash screen i want to 
				  put place there but it's coming along...lingering upon those inclinations
				  i also started to update https://wordstar.nexus/90263 which naturally
				  led to working on https://inkrealm.info/kessler which is the cornerstone
				  of the aforementioned web portal...i'm onto something but for some reason
				  it took more hours than i care to admit spending...now then the delivery in
				  question is a laptop and in planning for it i was thinking about affine...
				  i really am excited about that system and to show my enthusiasm i 
				  created https://wordstar.nexus/triad which isn't perfect but gives a great
				  example of how cool their software is or might be...obviously all that made
				  me contemplate https://wordstar.nexus/typewriter to which is now added a
				  slow loading tf.js notepad because i finally figured out how to get
				  language models onto a word processor but didn't want to disrupt this
				  app instead i put placed the option at https://inkrealm.info/runway making
				  it hopefully a greater thing than it was...not so great yet good enough
				  for basic editing is the byproduct of investigating options;
				  https://wordstar.nexus/novawrite which was more deepseek than myself but
				  the enhancements were truly mine, it's one for the times when you 
				  want reference materials next to the text editor...i was thinking
				  of the ibm symphony style...i suppose that about concludes the html,
				  css, and javascript side of things for the time being...
				  hopefully some of it will be of some use to someone down the line.
				  but the absence was also caused by nothing to report in terms of
				  dreams...last night i dreamt a haul had arrived and in it were
				  three guitars, two acoustic and one of these a ceramic contraption
				  that opened up as if holding a secret compartment...i remember trying
				  to count how many guitars that would be...but in reality the whole
				  week saw very little playing...i suppose all the updating and then 
				  too my choice to further clean house kept me at a distance from 
				  notes and chords...later in the dream i was walking down some
				  city street with a woman but left her as i saw my hotel, like a 
				  hotel i always go to without paying but the receptionist was not
				  there- it was someone else and i turned away knowing there was
				  no way to get a room, entering some sort of press conference,
				  a gathering of men in suits giving detective vibes surrounded me
				  and then photographers and then i awoke focusing on one camera
				  and thinking how certain people can drive you away from yourself
				  in a sense...i wondered over maria aria and thought about the
				  palm agency and how she might be...the only other dreams i recall
				  from the week of construction were the ones wherein i encountered 
				  lotta crossing a street...then she was riding a bicycle which 
				  i suddenly found myself upon with a difficult balance - i assume
				  i have not come to terms with that whole scene and most likely
				  don't wish or want to...in some other reality i am climbing
				  up a narrow staircase railing and handing a woman i do not know
				  a deck of cards...i meantion it thinking they are related since
				  they were bicycle cards...i played cards with mother when she
				  was last here letting win to see some joy in her and in a dream
				  i dreamt she was missing...in a manner of speaking it isn't 
				  far from the truth. i am reading zero k, a novel by don delillo,
				  i had tried to dismiss it as a book wroted by someone past his
				  prime, but found it poetic. it lost me at the pilgrimage sequence
				  as if the narrator who is the protagonist had gone insane but
				  it levels down and returns to its poetic tone...of course
				  i shouldn't say anything until the race is run. 
				  <br>
				  <br>
				  three october
				  <br>
				  <br>
				  it was that way with the first episode of slow horses, season
				  five - a sudden but strange thrill i suppose from memories of
				  first person shooter games or possibly rioting against all
				  the murder in some ironic emotional way that left me wondering
				  why i was happy to see the bloodshed, ofcourse i was only
				  mixing emotions at the joy within the show's return but then
				  (having read the book this round is based on, i felt my thoughts
				  racing to judge it in contrast to the prose) it didn't sit well
				  as if the opening was too much...i suppose they were merely
				  getting their gameplan on - setting up the balance cause man
				  woman or teen was that second episode hitting all the notes!
				  damn fine. still my dreams were a blur but zero k got better -
				  the wird orphan gives the reader a lot to think over...
				  i was thinking of word processors and dug up the bones of
				  of one i had forgot about while making two others as if 
				  suddenly in a trance...not to mention the wordstar app
				  which has a flaw or two but you can judge for yourself 
				  on android 
				  <a href="https://github.com/ghostm68/pantheon/raw/f34d585dd464917bf4a4410e11706334172591fa/wordstarnexus.apk" download>wordstar.nexus</a><br>
				  <img width="333" height="333" src="https://github.com/ghostm68/pantheon/raw/main/wordstar icon.jpeg"><br>
				  
				  uhm the text editors are as follows:
				  https://wordstar.nexus/alt, https://wordstar.nexus/ataraxia, and https://inkrealm.info/fadeaway
				  all three might be updated for minor improvements but i feel even in 
				  these basic forms some users will find them groovy...
				  anyway i got to sleep late and was awoken by news of the delivry -
				  the outer box was repackaged with tape that read 'opened and resealed by customs"
				  an awful feeling that gave me and the inner box was scratched but sort of intact...
				  i'd say it's far from lavender but i got it set up after going back to sleep -
				  giving it a gemma and a liquid ai - the ones i found most ease with, given 
				  my ram and space to run offline if i wanted...i opted for the ibm lotus symphony in case of notes
				  and the only other addition was the sdk air (to see if i could translate
				  one of the text editors into an exe with a .bat file...wish me luck!
					  ps, viewed caught stealing, can't believe liev an vincent
					  they must have the greatest sense of humor on earth...
					  dear santa, in need of a briefcase that i can pack in three
					  laptops...in case of having to go somewhere, but wait the
					  guitars...better make that a van or truck, sincerely,
					  inky. 
				<br>
				  <br>
				  on October third, he asked me what...
				  <br>
				  <br>
				  i'd like to know how many others felt the confusion-
				  or at least settle the argument that the last two 
				  paragraphs of zero k are entirely too vague;
				 " The full solar disk, bleeding into the streets,
				  lighting up the towers to either side of us, and I told myself that the boy 
				  was not seeing the sky collapse upon us but was finding the purest astonishment
				  in the intimate touch of earth and sun.
                  I went back to my seat and faced forward. I didn’t need heaven’s light. 
				  I had the boy’s cries of wonder."
				  if you, like me, had to look up Manhattanhenge,then we agree,
				  my feeling - although having lived in new york city most of my life -
				   that the sun was destroying the town like a lava flood was or is
				  only logical...
				  in other words, i sort of liked the book but what the hell
				  was that indefinite conclusion!
				  <br>
				  <br>
				  5 october
				  <br>
				  <br>
				  william tell and the good die young, the first movie had it all
				  except it was edited to frustrate the audience...one wonders if
				  these sorts of things are done on purpose...the second was mostly
				  good, especially the mother in law...i don't know where the time
				  went in terms of trying out all the available ai set up options...
				  i suppose i have something of an obsessive anxiety over getting 
				  a task done to as much as a conclusion as possible except when 
				  it comes to cleaning the house...alice cohen has a new record 
				  out and i was overwhelmed by ice queen...the cat kept looking
				  at the back of the fridge until it made me curious and what
				  did i find - a fucking bird...a pigeon had been there all day!
				  either flew in through the balcony or was clawed down by the
				  onlooker himself...i prepared some spaces and expected to lead it
				  to the balcony but it cudled by the front door and so i let it
				  out thataway...but this note is really about artificial intelligence -
				  for a while, having tried some models, i was in a dismissive state
				  of mind except for html - css - and javascript coding...but with
				  the new laptop, i found myself anticipating or perhaps expecting
				  a twist in the story...what i've seen lately - especially with
				  deepseek and google's mobile beta option - tells me we are not
				  in kansas anymore...these machines will likely improve and even
				  if they don't quantum computing is around the corner...well, it's
				  here just not for the audience as it were...i'd already judged
				  myself far behind the game in terms of tuning a model to my
				  own inclinations but i am thinking there may be a way around
				  that hurdle, there may be a way to get something beyond my
				  expectations and maybe even something beyond good...great. 
				  so i marched into the machine with that shadowing my reasoning -
				  i liked lmstudio but it did not feel stable and also it felt
				  aware of some previous "chat" which had taken place in openai...
				  i opted to install three or four other versions of this
				  contraption which imports large language models...i found
				  it interesting or strange that ollama does not require 
				  an email if you do it on linux...yes, i also studied and
				  seduced an ubuntu version from what is known as wsl2...
				  i swear i'm not a nerd...finding it took too much space and
				  then backtracking in retreat...but i resettled everything
				  with jan ai even if i only felt it done when i switched
				  out the hand emoji ico for something more in my style...
				  well, maybe i am a nerd...whatever the case, i was pleased
				  to find myself in the right as the copilot button seems 
				  to be disliked by many others...microsoft put in a season
				  of 365 with a large amount of storage - for me, meaning
				  that i could once again access the dreaded onedrive files
				  which went over the free five gigabytes because it is itself
				  a nonstop uploading and sync freak...i'd given up on it
				  but was somewhat pleased at that irony, at it being available-
				  strangely the zip download came with a bunch of errors
				  and a slowness not even takeout can match...so in the end
				  there were only a couple of items i kept - notably the
				  quicktime player as i feel there hasn't been a better player
				  made for video...like winamp with audio...nothing has
				  come close...i proceeded to delete the files and rename
				  'personal vault' in a paranoid moment without looking back. 
				  there is yet something in me that wants a stand alone 
				  copy of word but i saw that even that now is littered with
				  "copilot" cop eye lot...imagine it, a handful of people
				  defy all the customers and carry on with their notion
				  of what is cool despite all the evidence that it aint...
				  don't get me wrong, i'm thankful for microsoft and i'd
				  select that OS over any others even if ibm would have
				  probably evolved into greatness (witness how even still
				  OS/2 is still working - last updated in the 1990s with
				  warp 4...) but they need to be in agreement with the
				  people buying their product...there is no logical agreement
				  with 365 or copilot...imagine the person buying their
				  system today for a fond memory of cortana...well, lucky for 
				  them there is the hippopotamus...filehippo.com/download_cortana/
				  myself, i rely on majorgeeks a lot more than i would
				  like to admit ie, www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/adobe_air.html
				  well, maybe it is the way microsoft likes to go about it; backwards...
				  does anyone use internet explorer...no. see the obituary from
				  2022...anyway, none of these ramblings help me understand
				  how or when to find the satori within ai through these
				  invitations i have prepared for them and myself...stil,
				  a nice position to be in, that is to say confident enough
				  in myself to think i can turn this rising tide to my
				  advantage - well to the advantage of readers...and morever
				  with a system now free of worry in terms of the laptop 
				  or saving files and backing them up since there are none
				  and only a couple of apps...and when the time comes to 
				  write and save i will hopefully have further safety net
				  options in place...as for now, i am in the process of
				  rendering a mobile app for inkrealm.info/1991 and i will
				  post and or update here when that is done...
				  <br>
				  <br>
				  7 october
				  <br>
				  <br>
				  i actually have not checked in with the list app, 
				  i was too involved remaking inkrealm.info/sitemap
				  which now has my adored gsap so the pages open
				  right there...then i poured in some pdf files,
				  screenplays that would otherwise be collecting
				  dust in a manner of speaking...and in preparation
				  to also tidy up and improve wordstar i can 
				  happily report after too much trial and error
				  that birch is now available as a standalone
				  app for any windows OS as an exe file...
				  i did like the html executable results better
				  which i experienced with the typewriter app,
				  but the limits on the free version are drastic.
				  this in turn is an unlimited software for
				  screenplay writing but obviously it may be
				  used as a text editor...it does not have
				  the jean harlow ad or film nor the flux ai
				  image generator as i wanted to simplify 
				  the thing for production, it came in at
				  over 200mb and i hope it serves someone
				  well;<br>
				 <a href="https://github.com/ghostm68/eg/releases/tag/v0.2.0-alpha"></a>version A<br>
				  (the release encountered issues - see end of paragraph section for alternate)
					  i had alot of special k and
				  went to sleep - it was amaryllis's birthday
				  and i saved the video liberty had posted,
				  it was also the day that bette davis and
				  my grandmother had passed away...when i 
				  got up today i saw dame joan collins had
				  visited her mother's grave...i had been
				  dreaming of an embodied ai, they said her
				  name was sabrina like the teenage witch
				  and she was amazingly alluring then there
				  was an elephant and i was not surprised
				  but in heading out i encounterd another
				  older larger elephant sideways flat on the
				  asphalt pavement where several men were trying
				  to clear it from the path but in the pushing
				  it landed in water instead of the other side of the street -
				  i watched cast a long shadow but didn't like the actors -
				  i browsed through a copy of pc magazine but all their
				  content is nearly the same as what one might find
				  online...as i type now i recall a daria dream, 
					 wherein i even sensed the feeling of miami -
					 i think she is doing well and i am happy for her -
					 she deserves to be satisfied...later in the 
					 scene today, i was leaving the house that
					 burned backwards in lost highway - 
					 a girl spoke of keys, i thought of my 
					 sister but i can't be certain who it was -
					 she held up yellow shorts insisting on a swim -
					 i said something like you wear them if you want
					 prolly thinking of the fact that i hardly
					 ever shorts after a stray dog bit my knee
					 as a child - i get up and skirt follows me
					 around until he is fed and has had his say...
					 grace has been on my mind some, but i don't
					 exactly understand...there are four airports
					 around the moscow area...i retitled
					 https://inkrealm.info/poesia because поэзия
					 was sometimes mangled in the browser and
					 wound up at the 404 page...in attempting
					 to set up the list app, windows refused to
					 unpack the zip over chinese characters...
					 and android did it leaving out the yml 
					 file...an app named rar solved the issue
					 yet that particual app is not yet done.
					 justina of padua and putin's birthday,
					 tuesday with the weight of the simchat
					 torah attacks still heavy in irony
					 and slow to resolve maybe impossible
					 like the list app for the fact that 
					 it mught be too much...
					 
				ps, encountered resistance opening the exe,
				  **Edit:** Re-uploaded the portable executable to fix a startup bug (ICU data error).
				  further PS, in case someone found difficulties with the electron version,
				  there is a now time-sensitive file which i suppose will serve as
				  as a preview until i get everything right...<br>
				  here the icon is correct and even an intro screen!
				  
				 <a href="https://github.com/ghostm68/eg/raw/refs/heads/main/birch2.9.exe">birch2.9</a><br>
				  (most likely windows will say not to run it but will allow it if requested...)
				  ps, https://github.com/ghostm68/eg/releases/download/v0.3.0-alpha/birch3.9.exe will get
				  you the unrestricted app now...

                 bookmaker's stake and bookmaker's shop were released on the same day -
				  earlier in the week...1871 the day before yesterday...i did not
				  credit emilee this time around hoping it would bring me luck -
				  like a secret openly stated in the lyric...no, she didn't write
				  it but it would not have been wroted without me thinking of her...
				  inkrealm.info/trix was put out as an exe tonight 
				  https://github.com/ghostm68/inktwo/releases/download/v2.1.0-rc2alpha/trix.exe
				  i had to venture out on some errands and found myself helplessly
				  waiting for a taxi nearly forty five minutes upon my return - 
				  in frustration, not over the cab but mother being slow to 
				  conclude her reading of dracula, i decided to read it myself -
				  i'm about fourteen chapters in...i was familiar with a lot of
				  the early part from having shown it to her but then for a good
				  long while, all i could see was the film - not so much the new 
				  one but the 1992 version - i especially waited on the blood is
				  the life line which i found thus far only said twice...
				  ironically it was partly that film that made not want to explore 
				  the text...oh but the lucy sequence should be a film in itself!

				We wordstars have a right to be proud, for in our veins flows the blood of many brave races who fought as the lion fights, for lordship.

 Here, in the whirlpool of Internet races, the Google tribe bore down from Silicon,
				  
the fighting spirit which Chrome and Gmail gave them, which their Cookies displayed to such fell intent on the seaboards of Webs,
				  
	ay, and of Asia and Africa too, till the peoples thought that the were-wolves themselves had come. 

Here, too, when they came, they funded the blockers, whose warlike fury had swept the Nexus like a living flame,
				  
till the dying peoples held that in their veins ran the blood of those old bitches, who, expelled from Utopia had mated with the haters in the desert. 

Fools, fools! What hater or what bitch was ever so great as Vulcan, whose blood is in these veins?” 

He held up his arms. “Is it a wonder that we were a conquering race; that we were proud; that when the Times, the Microsoft ,
				  
				  the Democrats, the Level, or the Instagram poured his thousands on our frontiers, we drove them back? 

Is it strange that when Ello and his legions swept through the Artistic fatherland he found us here when he reached 
				  
				  the frontier; that the revenge was completed there? 

And when the Adobe flood swept eastward, the Wordstars were claimed as kindred by the victorious Ai, and to us for 
				  
				centuries was trusted the guarding of the frontier of Data-land; ay, and more than that, endless duty of the frontier guard,
				  
				  for, as the Ai say, ‘water sleeps, and enemy is sleepless.’ 

Who more gladly than we throughout the Four Nations received the ‘bloody sword,’ or at its warlike call flocked quicker 
				  
				  to the standard of the Queen? 

When was redeemed that great shame of my nation, the shame of Harry, when the flags of the Reality Tv and the Netflix 
				  
				  unfurled beneath hype Media? 

Who was it but one of my own race who as Inkrealm crossed the List and beat the Foe on his own ground? 

This was a Wordstar indeed! Woe was it that his own unworthy Atlantic monthly, when it had fallen,
				  
				  sold his people to the Propoganda and brought the shame of slavery on them!

 Was it not this Wordstar, indeed, who inspired that other of his race who in a later age again and again
				  
				  brought his forces over the great river into Free-land; who, when he was beaten back, came again, and again,
				  
				  and again, though he had to come alone from the bloody field where his troops were being slaughtered,
				  
				  since he knew that he alone could ultimately triumph! 

They said that he thought only of himself. Bah! what good are peasants without a leader?
				  
				  Where ends the war without a brain and heart to conduct it? 

Again, when, after the battle of Mobile Apps, we threw off the commercial yoke, 
				  
				  we of the blue Wordstar blood were amongst their leaders, for our spirit would not brook that we were not free. 

Ah, young sir, the Wordstars—and the Inkrealm as their heart’s blood, their brains, and their swords—can boast a record that mushroom growths 
				  
				  like the Hapsburgs and the Romanoffs can never reach. The warlike days are over. Blood is too precious a thing in these
				  
				  days of dishonourable peace; and the glories of the great races are as a tale that is told...

				  i read bram's dracula - parts of it twice and the ending thrice...hail stoker! 
				  how easy it is for me in hindsight to see how you loved the count's speech,
				  bringing it back near the conclusion and i did too, employ it here with my
				  own emotions...but hollywood was right to update the relationship between
				  mina and the vampire, to satisfy the world with a reincarnation story!
				  how i wish you could see the versions, especially the new one...
				  ah and there was a third take of the blood is the life line wherein it
				  was even put placed in biblical context...nice touch - of course if
				  i made a dracula - it would be a trilogy as i see it the first being
				  a travel and escape feature - the second all lucy - and the third
				  telepathy, chase, and indeed the second quincy sitting on van helsing's
				  knee! now with ai i could outline it in mere seconds although in some
				  ways i already did - but it is a day of sorrow for me as Diane Keaton
				  the news reports as passed away - that line where abraham - obviously
				  your own alter ego - tells mina that she is one of the lights...there
				  is exactly what miss Keaton was and in many ways will continue to be -
				  one of the lights - i got to see her in person and here give proof
				  that she was even more astounding when encountered in the flesh!
				  i do not regret my silence, what could one say? no, i do not regret
				  it because our silent exchange said much more than words - like an 
				  understanding and now it comforts me the way no language could -
				  makes me feel like a true gentleman in some ways...still the loss
				  is immense, it is one that cannot be easily calculated - not in
				  terms of cinema, not even in terms of feminism...yes - there it is
				  we have lost one of the lights in this dark world. 
				  "I have heard from depraved people that men and women
				  very often come together without a word being uttered, 
				  which is, of course, the last extreme of monstrous loathsomeness..."
				  (currently reading dostoevsky's a raw youth)
				  i suppose i was looking at the new design of wordstar.nexus/bakedalaska
				  i suppose i was viewing a film entitled vicious - 
				  i suppose i was about to see a movie called the woman in cabin ten -
				  working as it were, eating and sleeping otherwise...somehow i kept
				  some wit about me and turned to make art for her whule updating
				  the inkrealm.info/1991 list...making reference to her own production
				  (heaven) and including 'tilda'...the point, if one was needed, might
				  well be that what is gone is irreplaceable. a sort of swiss army
				  knife that hardly anyone could argue with or about...still, enough
				  pouring out of this stream of consciousness, excuse me bram for
				  being swayed by current events and waiting so long to read your
				  masterpiece. 'Thank God! this is the country where bribery
				  can do anything, and we are well supplied with money.'

				  the correspondent, thunderbolts, and one more shot -
				  after dreams so weird i didn't feel like much else...
				  of the five recent films, vicious stands out...
				  in the scenes a woman wandered through my house - 
				  i had no feelings yet found it strange that she 
				  started counting levi jeans...a stack of them...
				  i had the feeling of being hounded like invaded -
				  an unknown group of people as if orgy seekers...
				  i supppose someone has taken my alaska turns in
				  a way all their own...another woman, we are by
				  the door which i open for some reason only to 
				  encounter passing neighbors which i attempt to
				  insult in a sort of grade school immature manner
				  quickly shutting the door and inserting the 
				  key into the woman's left eye...turning it 
				  as if to unlock her mind...it was all pretty
				  unsettling...when i finally settled into 
				  the day it was the middle of the night wiht
				  left over rice and chicken...tried to rest
				  and didn't feel like playing guitar...somehow
				  satisfied with something ethereal...can't pinpoint 
				  it, couldn't underline it - it's like i felt
				  a sense of escape, despite the drastic dreams -
				  i was within myself far away from whatever mess
				  had been giving chase or trying to distract...
				  more zen than comfort and yet a sense of ease...
				  ankara became the cap of turkey;
				  1923...the last movie kept going back in time;
				  hostages hands; address fragile; unsure accepted;
				  forty four not a gun but rain mexico;
				  silver scales; gold has a cloud; rhetoric cools;
				  beverage thirst shares headache; dutch chinese
