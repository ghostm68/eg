        <h1>dreamweaver two</h1>
        <p>
         23 october 2024 oh to redeploy this on a smurf anniversary. i think i should have waited until the 30th,
		ezra pound day, or even november...yet there is a lot on my mind and writing is what i do...
		pelevin does not write in fact he puzzles over a position, sometimes in brilliant fashion,
		until drowning it with a sort of too much information for his readers to process...in my
		experience the nearest example for contrast would be phillip k dick...

		the writer had recently completed notes for a novel and was told pdk shopped
		at happy dog for horse meat when he was struggling to survive hence horselover fat...

		that is to say it is the type of style one encounters in valis except amped up as if
		the loudness allowed more freedom of speech i suppose...

		subsequently i read the horse stealers by anton chekhov...

		let's see before i delve deeper...i have decided to not include the preceeding notes,
		themselves possibly a book or two, these should stand on their own and if any reader
		would like them well i would not refuse a request to package them up and send them 
		through...

		my point is that writing freely should not be mistaken with writing for free, life
		is not free and even awful writing is paid...case in point, colleen hoover...

		or do women usually follow men into new york city restrooms after the author
		picks at bulgokov's entrance...

		ahem. i never realized how good lecarre was until reading his first novel which
		was perfection save for the jewess's confession and the ending list in any case
		miles above the film version which kept the wife as self-described nymphomaniac
		slut in a redundant twist that must've made john's head spin...

		yes i know too much prelude for dream notes and so here goes; 

		hurricane milton followed helene and i was haunted by the control weather brim skit 
		as many others thought the democrats were trying to smash the hard core red state
		voters to gain those delegates, those delicate votes...

		one ukrainian and his family got swallowed in florida after escaping the so-called
		war...the appointment in samara fleshed out with full irony...

		within my own contradictions i dreamt of a topless cousin and eating cake -
		later seeing her arrive with other girls...hadnt thought of her much since
		she never invited me to her wedding and later that evening i had a clear vision
		of her bed...excuse me i am not looking for parking, in fact i don't have a vehicle...

		the man mom married passed away on the same day as jack kerouac had, which was about the
		time she moved to the states over the hills and far away...

		something kept trying to connect me with him and i even felt it scan memory as if
		to say aha or even make it my demise...i was starting to even feel dizzy sick until
		james cagney directed shortcut to hell...

		i'm with zelda in france at some art class and it feels as natural as being
		with joan in england pub except one of them was taking my picture and i had not
		shaved and tried to hide my stubble as it were...

		floating in my apartment as if visiting myself - the cat is on one of the beds -

		finding myself in a car being kissed by ava and her triangle tongue, later
		speaking with zofia...

		a man was handing me a great variety of two dollar bills, i watched flightplan
		again and catchfire, how does one forget nudity - perhaps when the talent
		is so overwhelming that what remains is the method not the madness -

		loro was a real revelation and i had no answer to my own question, if you liked
		youth so much why not seek out other films by that director...

		the family friend was no let down, even thrilling once in a while -

		meanwhile the box of things minus the requested samsonite case i asked for
		which was sent out in june finally arrived in october...

		i was much more satisfied by the substance, i keep looking back at it amazed
		at its form...

		reminded after of the girl i walk'd some with - down riverside drive...

		dress as if meant to be recalled...packing suitcase as marlon talks -

		i think he was recording to tape also...talk of order, standing in line

		french fries conspiracy - a finger at my lip - what does the sticker say?

		two million dollars carrying a girl inside a movie theatre - someone is tracking

		us - i think of laura sophia instead of lotta, fresh air - i'm standing at the 

		entrance of a mansion, in fact i think i only dreamt of lotta once...in any

		case i recite the phone number that pre-dates me and is yet active -

		there are two women one undressed and bleeding it seems like menstruation

		unfiltered and left without washing but it is all so fast i cannot focus

		and awake like when walking on aluminum foil landscape - was it bird or insect

		at window suddenly mixed by chirp or crawling sound within me...not sure

		yet i was trying to escape...i cannot escape my lost apartment, there i 

		am with mother painting the hall i am going to my room convinced that my

		date is not coming, but the girl arrives wearing a pleated skirt which she

		raises in front of me as if to make me get up...there is an indian statue 

		with the word nadie or nadia and i like it deciding to put place it on

		my dresser...it wears a dark shawl, i start thinking they also did not 

		send my japanese cat statue...so when did i actually start to weep? well,

		during dominique when the boy dies protecting the girl oksana left in 

		a chained padlock light switch room...not that i'm the action packed type

		but someone called asking for leidsa numbers i think i said 34, 76,

		and 91...nobody called in terms of condolences. 
		
		(one call from an aunt followed this typing,

		which inspired me to invent a man who had

		a toaster for an ass which needed to be plugged in)
		
		alina sent nude pictures. (possible email scam

		but as a gentleman i try to reply pleasantly)

		i only cry in the movies and even if i spend the day smoking i never light
		
		up a cigarette in dreams...
		<br>
		<br>

		0ctober 24...dreams like visitations - well, visions to be precise...
		
		i had received a phone call, a nearly unusual event these days...

		so there was more talk than what has become ordinary - i suppose that

		along with texting went a ways into overwhelming my senses - 

		i went to sleep at the second hour after midnight thinking of

		book titles and elvis costello - one of us is lying...i get what

		feels like a locked car in the sun temperature or perhaps a sun

		soaked roof feeling and get up to let in fresh air and pour

		water on myself...when i finally get to sleep i dream that i am

		naked on my bed and someone starts speaking...i cover myself and

		feel cool enough not to wonder or worry since it is a know face -

		still, there is something about it upon reflection that is disturbing;

		this all becomes some sort of party, i wonder how long it takes

		to fly from warsaw to tel aviv but alexandra is actually flying to

		new york - there is now a group of people mainly girls - one of them

		remninds me of helena's jeans under a tied christian dior shirt

		she pulled on like you would a t-shirt...buttons must feel she does

		not like them enough to unbutton and so forth...well in the dream 

		it is not her, someone more spanish although possibly not spain -

		lotta hinted that she had a greatly good time in mallorca yet i 

		have not witnessed the recording myself...in the dream i feel

		drained while the woman in those specific jeans looks to be in 

		an orgasmic convulsion as if possessed like a spirit is making 

		love her or at least nibble kissing her neck yet no one is near

		and worse everyone acts as if nothing is going down...i must have 

		got up at some point and am standing in the crowd studying her -

		she has another fit in the epilepsy style except this time she

		is intent on reaching the source of her frantic excitement - 

		as she exits i see two men on a bed, there is a tv on and a

		laptop also on next it...i say something about turning at least

		one of them off and they don't disagree...i awake right after

		to find that i only slept a couple of hours...i jot the basics

		of the scenes, fill the bath with water and ivory and hope

		i can catch some more minutes of sleep and or dreams that make

		more sense before i slip into coffee and internet and such...

		thursday is rising fast and my only plan is to go through my

		scales especially the two new ones i keep mixing up - not certain

		why arabic translates in thought as if enigmatic and vice versa...

		(my ritual is now at eighteen scales, one of them

		my own hybrid creation...)

		ps. did more sleep did sleep more yet maybe too much...seen mallorca

		except she seemed more content in the paradoxe...i recalled another

		scene wherein some child dislodged a lens from my frames...i pick

		it up to see if it can be returned to place but it is shattered

		and much larger...dolce gabanna it actually happened in the city

		without a kid just a sliver missing, glasses i still wear...well,

		outside as for some reason i took to not wearing eyewear at home -

		meanwhile london and i never understood how sarcastic daniel's

		face could be but i mean that in a goodly way...expression, some

		faces need no words to communicate...lotta communicates eye patches

		in stories yet her puffy morning eyes are when i think she looks

		exquisitely beautiful...but now i know prada preceeded the perfume

		in dusseldorf...alison james wrote wilhemina tempest's obituary -

		 “We are such stuff as dreams are made on, and our little life is 
		
		rounded with a sleep.”

		i have inclinations to continue to employ the pen at ASDBL and

		even the alaska experiment yet it is not pressing, it is like

		ideas or notions i wonder if i should augment with...obviously

		wilhemina bring this to mind as i'm not sure if i made it clear

		enough that she branches out from the source muse character to

		another yes that and the fact that i think it might be good

		to list all the types of horses perhaps in a glossary as

		burroughs did with drugs...there is actually a buzz as if

		i am getting high on my own writing...

		 “You taught me language, and my profit on’t is,
		
		I know how to curse.”

		<br>
		<br>

		25 october -

		friday the funeral I did not attend or intend to go to...

		in speaking to the widow about my reasons, the point arose

		in mind's irony...well i had a dream that i was standing

		in a funeral ceremony viewing myself in the coffin...

		i said it was about the age of twelve but most likely it

		was later as it impressed me so that it was among the 

		first attempts at literature...the dream is true however

		the fear of it is not...i stayed up much later than 

		i wanted, getting up several times to make soup and 

		and to make coffee and even again to seduce the hunger

		into submission with a slice of bread...there was an 

		emptiness i could not explain...let us call it an invasion -

		a mystical raid that later even extended into language as a

		foreign song tried to spin around my head...

		it was late morning by the time i got to sleep, the hours

		herein reflect a european time zone - 

		early evening awoke from dreams that found me in a 

		modern building - the office type - i am trying to

		get a pair of shoes fixed and i am told by a woman

		where i could get that done...as i approach the elevator

		it shuts and slides down yet i hear someone say they

		will bring it back which nearly instantly they do as

		i then find myself holding a pair of adidas...it is

		an elevator operator like in a recent instyle story

		reel which lucy was in...i suppose it came to mind

		and there i am with her but it is like a pastry shop

		where i lose sight of her and start unwrapping and

		tasting and returning the sweets to their place wrapped, 
		
		as the voice of some other women recommends, i like the taste

		or perhaps i have not satisfied the weird hunger...

		i think to get some for the widow and the dream ends.

		i had viewed a japanese film, kubi, which is said to be

		about events in 1582...although crowded with bloody

		scenes and even a careless view of homosexuality or 

		if you prefer a degrading view of women
		
		(which should prove shocking enough to most),it still did not

		have that centerpiece alike hellboy the crooked man

		wherein the snake exits the girl's down there parts

		and slithers up into her mouth...the most striking 

		moment was the "delicious" poisoned snapper irony. 

		if only they could have bought dean martin's ain't

		that a kick in the head for the final credits.

                12 november...was it lennon, life is waht happens

		when you are busy making other plans...i did not

		intend to have to wait so long for a dream that

		made sense enough to put place into words...

		although i know the experience as commonplace to

		myself when under the influence of weed wherein

		dreams are so light they carry no weight in memory...

		meanwhile i kept cleaning house...i view'd several

		many more films, most recently thunderball, man woman 

		or teen was that tom jones belting out the theme...

		sean sucking claudine's foot...she was in a genius 

		bikini...in the dream it was evening and within that

		night the rain poured down in storm-fashion...the times

		wroted 'trump storms back' as if it wasnt enough to 

		have stuck their neck out on the silly endorsement they

		seemed to go with a cheap daniels jape...

		i remember i went shopping for a fan - thinking it sort

		of proved that 2020 was replete, filled with fraud...

		people, in the dream scene were running, crowds of them, 

		through the shadow of trees above where i walked which

		was a roadway, a woman was with me as we decided to hail 

		a taxi, japanese contraption spied letting out a customer

		and i got in as the girl vanished - a very little man 

		drove but on the side as one might find in those sidekick

		motorcycle - another man without pickles kept nearing 

		from the front i faced as if searching me for something -

		i searched through sofia's first well second failed film

		which is called priscilla, first girl i ever kissed in 

		some childhood lobby uptown, it starts ramones perfect

		directer by spector but i felt the cast did not resemble

		the reality, even graceland looked like an apartment not

		a mansion, vegas scene was nice, the hinted los angeles

		ending was cool yet like the book burning it didnt capture

		the impact...no elvis songs in the soundtrack sure was

		shocking...yes i know easy to monday morning quarterback
		
		pick apart and yes obviously a great amount of effort

		went into it...hopefully she will get back to form in 

		her next scenes...the driver did not want to go to 

		bella vista and i had to agree to be let out as near

		to my destination as he could manage...i awoke before

		getting anywhere, gabby got published with nowhere, usa

		and i was very happy for her without agreeing that the

		midwest is hell...or even frozen although i know poetic 

		language is what language cannot be...robert graves,

		the white goddess, a reading that makes me feel the 

		limit of my own recall. thousands of stories and 

		connections which are impossible to memorize...

		embraced it awake and held it asleep...one understands

		some of the major points, the intent, let us call it

		the premise...in itself a duality that aims to prove and

		provoke yet in the build up of facts and circumstantial

		evidence there is a dizzy sort of who or what question

		as the whirlwind spins into a series of explorations...

		i agree somewhat - not with the style - but with the 

		concept and feel especially thrilled that there is 

		no pop quiz at the end of this bizarre masterpiece. 

		the jews agree; the body should be buried...the outrun,

		say or see never looked so beautiful yet how could such

		an intelligent character be so dumb? well, drinking 

		does kill brain cells, they say...did love the ending. 

		these are not movie recommendations, merely notes for

		i know not what exactly except by definition as a writer 

		i scribble into the constant illusion of now...

		the past presents itself in emilee form again the run,

		in the book he mentions witches running around a place 

		nine times to cast a spell or the mirror walk behind

		the cursed one so their prat fall results in the stumble -

		there's a little girl, so precious and pretty, i am sure

		it is an illusion but i explain that yes i am keeping

		my promise to the extent that no masked intruder could

		make a fool of me...for a minute i wanted to believe 

		michael was innocent but then i asked myself and even

		ai what other man ever asked to sleep with someone's

		child nevermind the box of porn under the bed...

		ah yes, ready or not - a real modern classic with

		spontanous combustion...dear me i liked that one alot,

		in some ways a sort of documentary i felt for myself

		as i sometimes believe my family has always been out

		to rub out or switch off my dream girl...maternal

		grandmother being the exception, i digress...not meaning

		to have such a word count here dear readers if i have

		any other dream to report you will find it here...

		please note - warner brothers/level is pulling the

		plug on two skinny girls...i could remove the 

		catalog now but why would i? so i am letting it happen

		so it will be on their heads not mine and re-uploading

		the songs after that point. hopefully there won't

		be much downtime but so you know it is not a glitch

		in the streaming services or outlets circa 18 november

		and beyond. 

		<br>
		<br>
		
                13 november dream fading upon waking possibly eva green
		
		or lotta stichler, the knit sweater taking longer than
		
		i expected, the idea of twin sister sure is interesting-
		
		not so interesting is the day's unusual diet dessert
		
		flan on top of leftover chinese and two almond cupcakes -
		
		it's like being drowsy drunk on food...fueled with never

		say never again where sean returns to bookend the remake

		i make thoughts on megapolis, as i revist the ending 

		of the white goddess wherein graves gives the devil his due

		as it were...my bath so cold i yelped -

		where was i oh yes this one is not easy, i hope it is

		like depalma scarface which i couldnt understand until a second viewing,

		but i boubt it as this seems to require the faith of an inner child

		yet it is precisely achild in the role of an assassin...

		elvis impersonator felt weird unless one thinks of his daughter -

		my fued with it can be in the sum of two points;

		that lead actress seemed to be pulled from the cast of show girls

		and dud did not transmit emotions required for empathy and

		morpheus stands around as if he had really been killed

		in the apocalypse now boat a walking zombie also doing voice 

		over keeping in mind that he can memorize shakespeare

		it must have been the easiest role he ever learnt

		but if vourse iyt is not a movie...it is a family affair

		 a warning and a prayer with deliverance arrows

		my firs thought was oh no not a happy ending

		sensed tears at the dedication to wife

		once he was going to forget everythint he had learned

		and write like he was a teen, perhaps that is what 

		we have seen...director's cut? classified

		wondering why aaron kept leaving the fire arms released

		along with the extended version of caligula well

		woman of the hour had something, that is how wrong 

		we can be in judging...anyway i was hoping for a 

		sort of youth without youth vibe but maybe next time -

		at least there was a real sense of new york city in

		the apprentice...pre-disney manhattan might have been

		the message in me gap ol is...ford to city drop...

		of course the issue with outstanding acting ie

		the critic is that one starts rooting for the villainous 

		character...irony will drown us all...

		i tear up the picture of the fat man of the week

		tv show interview the dearly departed had done 

		finding it alone in a scrap book never started -

		i play my scales over the film concentrating on

		the gypsy...now thinking that's what dylan called

		elvis staying in a big hotel smiling as he appreached

		saying well well...i try to take a nap but the nap

		takes me further into thinking with the national

		soundtrack of ymca village folk rising in nonsense

		echoing...young mens christian association...

		maybe it will help jerry lee's cousin jimmy...

		maybe i have overdosed on film...certainly

		on porn...some other position postultes 

		god in the volcano or zeus...some of it makes

		sense and it gives me pause...perhaps i have to

		revisit joseph campbell's ideas...tomorrow and

		tomorrow alexander the great is named pharaoh

		but that 332BC, not because but before it's fun

		to stay at the why have we not been there...

		<br>
		<br>

		14 november

		i'd felt outside my self all day as if waiting
		
		for the evening and the i'd felt the evening
		
		was not waiting for me...

		they say the berlin ruling system collapsed,
		
		they say dw union is on a two day strike...

		maybe i was locked in a teledisco booth -

		some of the monkeys were given fruit loops...

		in terms of entertainment, i should have mentioned

                finally catching up with the second parts of 

		ahs 12 as well as american horror stories. 

		emma, have i got a story for you concerning

		the ambulance birth...but i didn't get why

		wear the bitch's headgear?

		otherwise i liked the liminal spaces idea

		but i really have an insnae bias against

		blubbler so i could hardly enjoy the 

		last part of the stories which should have

		brought to mind asylum season, yeah i was

		more worried that the buttons of her blouse

		were going to fly off into the the other

		actress's face...

		pre dream pissing on lotta's face...

		walking through the chelsea hotel thinking

		of the brazilian girl i went there with

		willy deville singing to walk that girl home...

		minutes or moments later it's all pretty dark

		and i seem to be without a body hovering or

		hooked up with some woman on amsterdam avenue

		who is upset over the drug dealers that stand

		around in fron of the shop she's trying to 

		get into...i hear the vague outline of her

		voice arguing against them and they seem 

		to be replicas of each other even in the

		way they are dressed...i don't know where

		this dream went - i get up too early but

		take a minute or a moment for cigarettes

		coffee and this note...marian is on my 

		mind as i give skirt the party mix eats...

		there's a text message about a wallet and

		it nearly derails all the details of the

		dreaming but as i type i start to recall

		the strange door dreams, three k where

		i find cheese and nickel bags thinking 

		to snack and go back to my room and puff

		when it sounded like someone was at the

		entrance...other door dream opening but

		then it does not fit like three quarters

		of it only which left a slender opening...

		here door a motley gang of men insisting

		that i am having a soiree and wanting to

		come in and celebrate as i stand there

		baffled and nearly upset...i had lined

		the back door with litre glasses of 

		coca cola bottles, but it was the front

		door. people are strange when you're a

		stranger should have been played.

		seven in the morning sweden, one in the

		morning here, eleven in the evening los

		angeles. this ain't the mud club or cbgb's...

		early afternoon in asian towns, sounds like

		monkey genocide in thailand...valencia might

		re-flood with evacuations underway, i hope

		padam padam is a hit but there is no logical

		way to juggle time zones...

		23 november...so much has gone down and yet 

		not much has happened...arrival of guest and

		groovy haul - my habit was to always buy one

		nice shirt when possible but i find myself with

		five new shirts all at once...

		a weird luxury. some rich dreams too yet

		mostly disintegrating as the waking thoughts

		rattle me up to serve breakfast and start the

		day...a few weeks ago i was very happy that

		lucy  was going to film in rome, i think

		where fellini worked out his scenese, and 

		i sure did have a dream wherein we were very

		friendly as if rejoicing yet lotta  had

		gone to new york and mentioned a girl named

		giulia which then made me think it might have

		been her in the dream...not much time for

		sleep as i don't allow my guest to cook or

		clean...but this is no complaint or protest...

		i play the substance everyday, today will be

		the fifth time...in fact i am looking forward 

		to it...there's a week or so left of this 

		"visiting" and i will try to report on the

		proceedings as soon as possible...posed

		one of the "taken down" songs and it was 

		a spirit breaking experience...the cover was

		not accepted since they require very specific

		dimensions, so my lock and key artwork went

		by the wayside for some stock image...then

		the exported catalog is all in wav files but

		this requires mp3 or flac...it was for -low fi-

		and they require at least one foreign language

		metadata and i chose traditional chinese which

		then had to be augmented by simplified chinese...

		i could not imagine doing this for thirty songs...

		would you? the lyrics of it's a long way to the top

		if you want to rock and roll never mentioned such

		tedious work involved in getting one's music out...

		for reference; (low fi)<br>

-------<br>

well, stuck inside of mobile with the memphis blues again did

	sort of say there was some sort of repetition involved

		in the "creative" process; smoking eyelids

		and punched cigarettes...

ashes when i have tray time i will see if there is another

way to get the other songs out in the format they already have...

i listened to it again thinking sure it's not a hit but it is not

run of the mill...usually it's books that go out of print...

to have this happen to songs is beyond bizarre...

sort of like gogol's the nose! 

well, here's wishing you all a decent thanksgiving. <br>

		27 november...i dreamt yesterday that iwas

		flying to to europe from the states...germany

		i suppose as that is a recurring scene in my

		dream mind...in this case the airport and 

		luggage were all very detailed - someone was 

		speaking as if asking questions, not sure what

		i said...did recall a pre-dream nightmare

		wherein i am talking to my sister as if

		hypnotized...she had actually dropped by -

		then again yesterday with her motley crew...

		went to sleep late smoking and wondering why

		lotta was still in new york...i dreamt playing

		guitar with the stones and trying to figure out

		some song about a feline in the key of c major...

		i got up early feeling tired all day - but it was

		rainy and i rather enjoy the downpour...she got

		miu miu eyewear and was on her way to the plane...

		i actually have not taken the time for notes or

		chords although i did make a leather strap for

		the ibanez...the idea was that not playing my

		daily scales would help her in some way...silly 

		yet it satisfied something in my thoughts...

		or more correctly in my superstition - 

		anyway i am looking ahead to getting back in 

		rhythm tomorrow...besides, in skipping the 

		thanksgiving shingdig, i will have the evening

		all to my self, well myself and skirt...

		had not heard the song flight 505, well five

		days left of hosting after tomorrow  as the 

		guest leaves early on the first week of december.

		word to the wise, don't dare miss say or see 

		singing one of the blitz songs in the studio, 

		it is exceptional or to kick at madonna's nerves

		some; it is neat. 

		<br>
		30 november...weird watery dream wherein there 

		was a screen embedded into the faucet handel

		of the shower...it resembled one of those

		ancient portable tv screens but smaller...

		invention dream; shower faucets with media 

		screens...

		hmm...then of course i did not have a free

		thanksgiving as my guest decided not to go out -

		at least the lions won...memories of detroit 

		swirled in thought...then further into childhood

		and my jacket...they have never gone all way -

		i really liked that jacket...you gotta lose

		your mind in detroit rock city...billy idol

		covered bob dylan's if not for you, i heard

		grace slick talking and was amazed by her 

		honesty - but how is time magazine ten dollars?

		back to scales, felt no lapse. guest did venture

		out to visit someone else and so i do have part 

		of taday free...in a moment of idk browsed the 

		perlude to moby dick and thought melville had

		influenced me more than i realized...lotta left

		via  gate 65 and arrived, an hour late, via gate

		66...i thought the detail was quirky...lauren 

		got a ritual candle and robyn erased her kill 

		bill halloween pictures which i now miss...

		third day of pizza but my stomach has been sensitive

		for two days...i didn't expect, at this point, any 

		dream recall at all yet last night the scenes were

		pretty particular - as if i had married virginia 

		and one of her children was even calling me daddy...

		then moving into an apartment which was more like 

		a mailbox building or perhaps the locker in the 

		substance where the packages are delivered...

		everything seemed so compact...i always feel this

		place itself is too big for one person but i like

		the options of several rooms...in the one room 

		dream i sensed sister invading thought as she had

		said she was going to an apartment hotel for the

		weekend and when this happens i always wonder which

		one of her known relations has slipped into my place

		as if i were him or the like? well they are scheduled

		to leave on tuesday as well as my guest...
		
                great fun with the story of the fruit vendor who

		sold a banana which was used to make art and then

		eaten by a millionaire...that antique song that

		said bananas have to ripen in a special comes to 

		mind...cheers.
		<br>
		december one
		<br>
		sunday - i first heard it within everyone says i love

		you...marshall brickman gone at eighty five...nap

		snapped into song, 'i got a notion to love you 

		all day' heard it as if had already been wroted...

		dream in the park i talk too much and can't think of

		what to say then say, i contain multitudes, which is

		a song that was alredy wroted yet i only have a vague

		memory of it since i concentrated on murder most foul

		and later on key west philosopher pirate...

		this was not intended to segue from herman, but such

		is life...late at night a flood of emotions resolving

		in hunger that made me get up again for bread and

		ironically coffee...awoke minutes before nine - dream

		lotta's mother seemingly setting up lunch or some 

		meal in a very exact way...i'm not sure, but it was

		pretty impressive and for a minute i wondered trying

		to figure out the scene aside from inner intuition 

		what it was about...like a self interview, is she

		telling me something, i usually don't eat much but

		there is no need to set up a table meal, i should

		get up and look after my guest, it seems dark but

		the foil on the windows doesnt let the sun in, if

		it is lotta's mother then why do i feel attracted,

		oh no i am excited, now how am i going to explain this...

		the misfits is on prime. i'm in the middle of grand hotel,

		i've been in the middle of it ever since the guest arrived...

		the list of films was updated but my viewing list is now

		way overdue...nothing can be done about til tuesday...

		<br>
		monday two december <br>

		after waking up way too early, i returned to sleep, 

		and woke up a bit late...i'd been thinking about

		presidential pardons and sir elton john's eyes...

		my guest continually invites me to new york...

		i suppose it makes me dream of the city. well,

		the parts that i know...you cannot actually know

		a town like that...every few streets might be 

		like entering a different country...even the

		seemingly empty spaces like tenth avenue on the

		west side or york avenue on the east are entirely

		different types of desolation...one feels industrial

		and the latter feels richly secluded even like a 

		suburb - at least that is my feeling. i suppose

		it was more in the middle, in the mid town area

		perhaps right below columbus circle...i sense the

		crowd and the countless lights, some woman asks me

		if i am drug dealer...i think only dh marks fits

		into that category...how many names bring back 2016...

		too many. i say no, quickly thinking of the ad,

		say no to dr-ugs and hoping that at least some of

		my stories and songs are addictive. meanwhile the

		cinema list has surpassed two thousand five hundred

		titles with additions from the silvia pinal filmography.

		mexican film has not had a good day in years, my favorite

		is el esqueleto de la senora morales...
		<br>
		december 4. pre departure dream sitting knees up on the
		
		the floor beside the conclusion of some sort of trap-door

		slide where a girl gently crashes into me, i could see she

		had arrived with someone else yet he vanished and we lay

		there with sort of embraced legs, it felt like until i 

		went seemingly backwards into the trap-door and down

		with a falling naked feeling which was suddenly dressed

		and dressed again by what i can only describe as mail

		bag pouches with a much softer material...say they were

		heavy cotton yet these were soft linen with the same 

		sand coloring although neither beige nor tan...

		subsequently my guest left. given that it was mom,

		well, it sure seemed to be her once in a while, i

		felt utterly alone. weird how one can get used to 

		living by one's self yet seeing and serving another

		underlines the desolation, redefines it...ruins the

		illusion of what it means to be content...the girl in

		the scene i thought was kia, in other scenes there

		are other people in the house and mom is cleaning to

		which i react in opposition against the mop...stomping

		on one fellow as if a wrestling match...last night

		dreaming of walking down a road the type that is 

		sleek asphalt yet surrounded by forest...strangers

		gathered, surrounded...for some reason i argued that

		i could not be detained because i needed to get back

		to help mother. i felt danger in the outnumbered

		position like a dying man circled by vultures...

		i cleaned my room which had been neglected for 

		cleaning the rest of the apartment, i learned the

		word semiotics which i don't like and will possibly

		never use in conversation...i learned the chords

		of a song for you and heard the story of how sir

		elton john saved leon russell from the ditch on 

		the road of life...yet it seems he was supposed

		to be a sort of underground giant, i mean even 

		as much music as i hear, i only met his songs

		because i searched out will the circle be unbroken

		once upon a time a few months ago...strange. 

		i suppose bertrand and later kurt possessed the

		name so fully that no one else has a shot with it...

		in a dream i am working and a girl is trying to 

		get me to continue working without pay and in return

		she will flash me her tits fifty thousand times giving

		me an example preview...pink red nipples i could

		hardly remember her face thereafter as she turned

		away leaving me with the image of her chest...a man

		starts speaking perhaps asking if it is a deal but

		i think i only start making excuses...later shopping

		but also sweeping dirt from the floor...something

		is missing from the items i ordered at the last place

		and another woman is shwoing me the options...eight

		o'clock closing in on nine now...my to do list involves
		
		eating, taking out the trash, and laundry...hopefully 
		
		everyone else is gearing up for christmas the only

		x-rated holiday that isn't sexual. 

		<br> december 5. the reason for a song for you was

		to play it everyday, but in the irony of life it 

		got entwined with my thoughts of mother...

		therefore, i opted for deep elem blues which also

		gives me a lot more options in terms of improvisation

		with lead riffs...i think i have the chords and some

		fills now i need to learn the words...will record it

		when it comes along...took a nap after meal and doing

		what i wanted or needed from my to do things, but then

		i was up late mostly thinking of lotta as if possessed

		by something that was never exact, never explained...

		time swimming like an olympic swimmer into dawn before

		i knew it. nothing in dream thought and it seemed some

		one due to proximity had invaded the scene wherein i am

		standing there listening to a story about how some people

		were living in a stranger's apartment and some other people

		questiong what they would do when the stranger arrived...

		in other words nothing that felt relevant to me...

		yet i note it as i don't make up dreams, maybe it will make

		sense down the line. alliteration in the news, deny defend

		depose, with at least one outlet also employing the word

		divulge...from the fourteenth century etymology ;

		"Middle English, from Anglo-French deposer,
		
		from Late Latin deponere (perfect indicative deposui), 
		
		from Latin, to put down"

		nobody should get shot outside any hotel but i like that

		'depose' is in circulation as it were...oh sweet mamma

		your daddy's got them deposed blues...

		<br>
		december 6.  i reglimpsed the start of grand hotel, 1932...

		then picked up where i had left it two weeks ago when my

		guest arrived. i will try to note my reaction without 

		spoilers and explain the sensation...there are two aspects,

		i went into it trying to understand greta garbo and then 

		upon watching trying not to mix up barrymore with klein...

		there was also the buzz in my thoughts that brought me to 

		it which was lotta having a family dinner at the grand hotel

		stockholm wearing one of the sweetest sweaters i have ever 

		seen...well there then, this movie is very good and i could 

		nearly understand the gg hype...however no luck with klein

		vs barrymore...still, the emotion overpowers the contrasting

		or rhyming appearance and at a certain point all i was thinking 

		about was the character and maybe the pocketbook...it is one

		of those films to view a few times merely for the fact that

		- as ms hynde sings - they don't make 'em like they used to...

		someone tried to make a production of me throwing out the 

		old sony radio or maybe all my attempts to get to sleep early

		converged into an irony that kept me up late again...

		i sure did dream something, i think now of lauren's neat

		drawers - maybe she got her christmas decorations done -

		i can't say what it was since i awoke sort of hounded by

		someone at the ten oclock hour...did i look too pale?

		why on earth is it that some people cannot simply agree

		to disagree...a line from license to kill resounds in 

		thought, dylan or the management that runs his tweet

		spoke of the film "based" on him or who he used to be...

		myself i refuse to see anything that actor is in since

		a rainy day in new york...because he was so helpful in

		firing up the witchhunt against the director...anyway

		cate blanchett prolly did a better bob in i;m not here

		or was it there...i'm not there...you ain't goin' nowhere...

		seven deadly sins magnitude kaliphornkneeah, they said after

		one man in butte county said to himself hey let me shoot

		at the kindergarden kids meanwhile a falling statue killed an

		eight year old in the next door state...
		
		not a good day to be child in america...

		otherwise i feel good, maybe not in the james brown way,

		yet good enough that if someone tells me to play that funky

		music, white boy, i could or possibly would. now then for

		woody; www.nytimes.com/2024/12/02/movies/woody-allen-marshall-brickman-q-and-a.html

		wherein you will learn about the word Anhedonia...

		december 7. pearl harbors before natalia's birthday. i thought about the

		nearly logical thread that ran all the way from that film into london

		boulevard...don't be upset if i didn't mention joan crawford, she will

		be put placed prominently on the list...i viewed the great beauty -

		the opening only confused me and felt as if the director was teasing

		the audience...or like someone reluctant to let in the crowd to see

		the plot...yet it developed nicely...partly eclectic and partly 

		ironic...especially at the end which contains a great gift in the

		form of music; the beatitudes by vladimir martynov. 

		(kronos quartet)
		
		a piece that floats in a space all its own and cannot be contained

		by descriptive words, it has to be heard then one might give it

		an emotional setting upon each individual listen which could run

		the spectrum of several feelings...

		i got up well after noon after a long night thinking about lotta

		as i learned the nine months ago story when she missed a trip

		to portugal...in my dreams i was sitting somewhere where i could

		see the stairs...staring at the stairs instead of stars go figure;

		i hear the explosion that preceeds fire and see a man race up

		as if he had just set the nearby building, which in my dream mind

		i knew to be a drug den, ablaze...i thought well some people can

		never win but coldly as if empathy and myself had lost touch...

		later, certainly even colder, i am sitting elsewhere, trying to

		avoid another man as one of his friends arrive smiling at me

		like i am salvation personified...i don't like these people 

		yet in my dream mind there is a real illumination, a wisdom

		that leaves me miles away from them even as they near then

		one of them mentions not having anyone to help him although

		the other one is still there...i take it as jab at my aloof

		state of mind and for a second i am forced to look at them

		as if there were no stars in the skies only to awake wishing

		i had not had that dream and still feeling the slime of their

		greed as i walked into the hallway to fix the start of the day.

		<br>
		december 8. i had read that the rebels took Homs and were

		entering Damascus as the dream i didn't note flashed in memory

		where i was either licking or tickling a woman and suddenly

		could not escape the squirting streaming into my face...

		i don't know much, but i do know that cate left her career

		to be with kevin and i havent seen him in anything since

		the christmas balls movie...i then read that assad fled

		syria- luxury cars on display at the telegraph...

		which made me think deny defend depose was pre-coded to

		announce the toppled regime...but i think too much when it

		comes to these things...in my mind what was truly interesting

		was hearing cole porter at stella a life since that is when

		i really felt admiration for kevin yet had not seen barrymore

		uhm so there i was in another film with him in mind well with

		him and elvis costello did let's misbahve on that soundtrack...

		but the film and paula beer is a powerhouse...not to mention

		that it is a true story...my only question with it was the 

		failure to clearly claim the fact that many of the jews were

		also german - some even more so than the "germans" - it is 

		hinted via the lead's father; noted as a war veteran but i 

		felt that irony needed to be fleshed out a bit more. anyway

		to see jews working as gestapo agents in berlin gives such

		a rollercoaster ride of emotions that is like a drug...

		so very high with this film, indeed. STELLA. EIN LEBEN.

		then the shooter outside the hilton hotel and the rebel

		leader were identified in social media and in the press

		although it will most likely not be confirmed until tomorrow -

		i can only confirm that i dreamt of being in another house

		and sighing in the knowledge that the sink could not be used

		while observing someone open the faucet and watching the

		waterworks spill out from the sides and the pour down from

		the ceiling...there was a broken toilet in the corner next

		to the centered toilet...which caught my attention, usually

		there might be a bidet but who knows...so happy to write this

		as in a typo i came up with the word onserving...the cashier

		was onserving coins on the receipt upon the counter...

		in another dream uppermarket, why am i there, i am intent on

		getting exactly three items, cigarettes and two other things

		not as important as marlboros but there is a man with a beer

		belly buying sandwiches and i can see the filled bread and 

		i can feel him stand way too near as he put places his arm

		across my shoulders and starts to sway as if in celebration

		which i cannot understand squirming with a shrug awaking...

		when the ick is onserved one must pick out distance to be 

		preserved...i get up and pick lotta to worship and extend

		the distance from that dream...yet as i do i see froseth 

		pictured with a man eerily like the one in the tuppermarket

		scene. so the two jakes, jack was right. it never goes away.

		ps, bring back spy magazine so i can submit the separated

		at birth photograph of the actor in kiev alongside

		Abu Mohammed al-Jawlani...or as mellish said, I object, your honor!
		
		This trial is a travesty. It's a travesty of a mockery of a sham
		
		of a mockery of a travesty of two mockeries of a sham...

		<br>
		meanwhile i have heard the deposed leader is already in moscow,

		not idaho.
		 <br>
		9 december.  sunday i somehow sidestepped the loud talk outside and

		the man yelling super colmado over and over as i had my pizza and settled

		into blitz with high hopes since i thought the coat song was really 

		special but i can only recomment the soundtrack..cheesier than the pie,

		it pulls at the audience via emotional traps plus put placing lectures

		all along the way as if the viewer needed lessons in social studies...

		it might be the only film to feature a dwarf and still not be worth 

		watching...all mouth and no trousers might well be said of itself...

		if you look at it closely you'll notice say or see asking herself

		what the hell am i doing here...the director supposedly wrote it

		but was it a joke poking at curious george? nobody could write such

		a thing! of course, we all want a perfect society and equality yet

		celluloid like this is more dangerous than helpful...if only the

		producers would now have to take the mta to get around balancing

		the cost of this corny turkey...they hit all the notes but it still

		lacks truth and sounds hollow unlike the lead's fine voice. 

		enoch powell is possibly turning over in his grave...

		i put this all out of mind asap and even managed to get to sleep

		early yet awoke too soon...i dreamt i was drinking although i don't,

		there was some argument and i was wearing a scuba diving suit inside

		a brick walled room that looked like a bunker or basement...i could

		hear someone screaming like i had during the day and stepped out of

		slumber wondering how to get back to sleep but wrote this instead...

		hmm to think i=of it blitz takes place partly in the timeline of

		stell a life, but there is something exceptional in the german

		while the english only has that bit of irish magic to hold it 

		together yet even the magical needs a logical poise.  there is 

		a moment when she is saved from a falling wall left over from

		air raid and hopefully this will be manifested in her career. 

		i love say or see but i did not like this fiasco of manipulation

		and propaganda. 
		<br>
		december 10. as i squandered most of my day in the secret spaces

		of self reflection, fantasy, and escape i started to feel well

		what hamlet said, i lack advancement...had i never wroted a 

		poem song story novel screenplay...had i never done anything...

		perhaps it was zen or a sartorial stance...i felt empty as in

		devoid of motivation...i did need to go out and was confronted

		by someone telling me he was desperate as one of his something

		or other needed a pint a blood which he claimed cost a lot...

		i tried to be polite but i doubt there was any truth in it...

		as i pondered further, i finally said to myself why am i even

		contemplating this void within...if it is depression then it

		should be respected...to lose parts of oneself is no trivial 

		matter and when it happens in slow motion as it is with aunt

		and mother well there is silent ongoing mourning that cannot

		be explained...so i held myself together saying there is no

		need to hurry past this time...i waited for lotta to post

		but she was at a christmas business party...i kept seeing

		julia wulf on social media and at some point was even tempted

		to write a poem for brooke pufky as i thought back to her 

		extreme kindness and how the world could use love like that

		which instead is focused on her children - but i figure

		one day those kids will be in the world and it will be a 

		better place because of her...when i talked about that film

		which baffled me by its lack of logic, i noticed that is was

		the coin that somehow remained in the hankerchief pocket

		despite the leap from the moving train and further that 

		there is royalty with that name but i don't want to repeat

		myself to myself on these matters...i had glanced at silk 

		and butter - some sort of agency - well silk&butter ug
		
		and in my dream, well there was this very clear vision 
		
		of helena pre-dream as i stretched into sleep, lotta

		saying i never read a poetry book...
		
		i was surrounded by several women

		none of them familiar yet very pretty and well dressed but

		ravenous especially with the butter, we all had bread but

		it made me start to scoop up a bit more butter thinking they

		would leave none for lotta...yes indeed weird given that

		i gave up purchasing the product being that they want

		nearly four dollars for a stick and more when it is a 

		a luxury brand meanwhile the domestic variety is simply

		a greasy disaster...so yeah some prices make no sense,

		bacon here costs more than steak...i had previously awoken

		haunted or hunted by words i had said, i wondered if my

		uncle had died. the thoughts so swift there was no chance

		to distinguish meaning, for example one of his sons is named

		michael yet in mind or memory i instead saw kilmer and then

		thought about how much i liked dylan's version of things

		we said today...yet all this in milliseconds as i awoke 

		leaving behind whatever it was i had dreamt about...

		i went back to sleep and got up in the late morning

		with nothing to report - skirt had two cans of trout

		friskies yet still pressed me for milk...i think now

		it is good enough that i slept easy so why worry if i 

		miss a scene from rapid eye movement. i feel so right

		and logical in this type of thinking because it is true

		and positively should have no need to prove myself

		further...ps, cool minute as joan corrects the daily

		mail over dallas, son volt started playing in mind;

		looking at the world through a windshield...

		much better than the warlord killing a hundred ten

		folks over the voodoo sensation blame or the naked lookalike

		that was too much emilee grant on the heels of having

		thought of her wondering if it was a fake...girls, 

		if you snapchat nudes they might end up on amaleaked...

		or elsewhere - there then now i am going to escape into

		leftover pizza and the heretic - open letter to hugh;

		thank you mister mickey blue eyes but please don't give

		no more cigars to the children or at least consider

		giving them filtered cigarettes if smoking is the point. 

		<br>
		december 11. there are times when even if it feels nothing

		is going down - or going ahead - there is still or might be

		a sensation that one is where one is meant to be...

		that is what i thought watching heretic...which i would have

		appreciated less before reading robert graves' the white goddess.

		i don't want to get into religion as the facts can't stand

		against faith...i do want to wish for a prequel wherein the

		reed house is decorated and detailed...in any case, this really

		was like taking a drug and it is possible that i am still high

		from it. oh wait back to my point about timing, this one is a

		stretch but allow me to play with the thought...so after 

		my george rant, this picture signals the landlord game which

		i learn was created to make people aware of georgism...

		thy letters have transported me beyond this ignorant 

		present and i feel now the future in the instant...

		please note it is a horror film although the golden globes

		might tell you later it is a comedy or musical...

		let me move on, further into now...or then to be precise,

		i have gone to sleep twice, the first time as i drifted away

		into what i am terming pre-dream state, i heard a clear

		bit of conversation where someone was trying to edit a book

		of mine, it sounded like a suggestion but also like someone

		pretending to be writing it...pretty upsetting for a writer

		to ponder if there is a rewrite happening without his 

		consent...who knows? perhaps it was an anxiety from the 

		film...by the way if you stay for the credits you will find

		the disclaimer that no generative artificial intelligence

		was used to create this a24 production...i went to work

		on the cinema list and exceeded my expectations although

		i have yet to update the synonym site...when i finally

		got to dreams, i was surprised to see lotta since i usually

		don't dream of her even if very often in my thoughts and

		musings...i can't recall the scene exactly yet i remember

		thinking how beautiful she looked therein as if really

		seeing her. so bright, so right. i left dreams and 

		felt determined to sort out a meal plan and get the kitchen
		
		in order yet i got into this scribble jot note awith

		coffee and cigarette and suddenly feel like writing a bit

		more - or at least thinking about putting pen to paper

		as it were except it is too soon as my horse novel is still

		being settled and i sense that the white goddess deserves 

		another run through simply to get to missed secrets in the

		clutter of connections...so many names and myths...wednesday

		well i have the fuck kill or marry film yet no idea if the kitchen

		will succeed or what to cook...
		<br>
		12 december. did the kitchen while listening to the haunting of

		hill house by shirley jackson which i liked more than expected...

		i found that pretending the cleaning was for someone else made it

		all easier...as for the film, well you couldn't really call it a

		film since it was a sort of sitcom where you could tell which 

		places the commercials would go...a strange pilot that puts place

		a woman in a position to date while a serial killer is hunting

		dating women...exasperating? well, maybe insane. i felt awful

		for lucy, it seemed to me she had some success in recent movies

		and might possibly be sort of upgraded but here she is with

		motley crew of wanna be leading men which only bring her down

		to their level...a sort of b-movie straight to video on demand

		type...i think the popular term now is cringe...i blame the

		abc seven year run as she ends up with the ags guy a sort of

		carboard cut out with a beard...yes i know comedy is very 

		difficult to pull off but to not have one good laugh makes

		it feel as if a hatchet job to sideline ms hale to the ranks

		of john ritter - southworth - although he did manage to be

		in bad santa before the end...i'd have to look up what the

		failed show called life with lucy was about if this were

		to be an essay...it ain't. still a third film adaptation

		of THOHH in slapstick style would've made more sense...

		i mean if you have a split personality comedy/horror then

		the source material should be something worth it. 

		"Don't do it - Eleanor told the little girl; insist on your

		cup of stars, once they have trapped you into being like

		everyone else you will never see your cup of stars again..."

		see how good that writing is...too good. well, maybe they

		thought the title was powerful enough, but this was 

		very far from being the tits.  my apologies to elisabeth

		moss for always thinking of her when i think of shirley 

		jackson. now then, the book along with lotta's hello 

		fresh video helped me displace that film, dispose of it

		as i wondered why there are so few blue cars around...

		i played my scales and ran through deep elem blues...

		but got caught up for hours trying to figure out how

		to judge the death of the last survivor of the kamikaze

		attack and make it rain in malibu...when i did sleep,

		i thought i was with lotta yet i am nearly sure it

		was inka and we were laying upon some road where a

		stones played we were both singing along but i only

		heard her voice as i missed some of the words then 

		we walked into a theater, the ancient type i guess

		you'd call it ampitheater...i awoke then wondering

		if i had dreamt of williams or stichler...most likely

		williams who subsequently spoke of the stupidity of

		people on the roads in baliland...why are the b- shoes

		so good, bally's - bruno magli - she was featured in 

		an arabian magazine and i am happy for her although

		the dream sort of baffles me...i have a wish for 

		crocodile shoes now that i have seen them in saks,

		if only to dance to elton's crocodile rock...lalalalaaaaa...

		it is not entirely a serious wish, call it a whim...

		but it is like those overpriced watches, i'd rather

		spend that type of money on guitars...where was i not

		strumming in another dream, jennifer is there and i

		don't think we spoke much except maybe about white 

		boy rick which i liked alot and believe to be a 

		true story if memory serves...it;s noon time or

		midnight in asia and the lights went out derailing

		my train of thought which switched to boulder colorado...

		where that fuck marry kill was set, no wonder the 

		fraternity news said six students had overdosed...

		disembodied poetics, perhaps it's time to review

		the burroughs' lucktures from nairopa...craig

		is getting raves for his performance and i am 

		secretly hoping he will pull the sean connery

		return stunt somewhere down the line as bond. 

		spies used to be termed ghosts so it might

		still make sense... meanwhile i am reluctantly going to check out

		'emilia perez' not that i listen to hype but

		so i can see for myself...hey, selena, continued success

		to you.

		<br>
		13 december. well that was really something out of the

		ordinary...conversational songs that were not trite

		for the most part, yeah for the most part there is 

		nothing to complain about here except it did not 

		make sense for a person in hiding, or even simply

		trying to turn a new leaf, to go into the limelight...

		but i see how it added tension...so i liked it even

		if i protest the newsy interviews of the protagonist.

		cheers or bravo...hmm, i am writing this about an hour

		after going to sleep...it is still the wee hours but

		my dream was so weird that it delivered a jolt as it were;

		there is a gathering of people in the living room and 

		i don't like one of the men there but i go to bed

		after feeding skirt who was wounded in the scene

		and i had to lift him up for the plate noticing there

		a flattened sort of foreleg paw, in my thinking i 

		chalk it up to the kids running around carelessly

		as it seems there were also children then as if reflecting

		or foreshadowing itself i get up from bed quickly dressing

		intent on kicking out the man i dislike, as i dress i can 

		hear mother agreeing to go to the shop and return to cook

		some sort of meal which she is excited over, i grab the 

		keys and make my way down the hall - on the kitchen counter

		a record is playing, vinyl, i want to love you night and day

		it is singing in a doowoop style heavy on the vocals, male

		vocals, i had been wondering how could i see myself and for

		a second worried about some recording device in the apartment,

		i start telling no one in particular that that man cannot be

		in my house while reaching to shut off the spinning song -

		i get up shocked that only minutes have transpired...i take

		out the trash still confused by the crowd in a dream within

		the place that contains only myself and skirt...the sensation

		was frightening as i felt it was something urgent yes like

		blood rushing to the head yet there is atruth contained in

		it and that is that there are people who i avoid based on

		some instinct, some perception, some inner wisdom which

		has served me well. catching my breath as it were, i 

		wonder if robert graves was right that the white goddess

		will haunt the poet until his muse is properly satisfied...

		will battle against his distractions and even his wealth

		to keep the need or desire to exceed his own verses...

		i listen to another chapter of the haunting of hill house

		but i am thinking more about lotta than the narrative...

		a lot more in fact.

		<br>
		14 december. the inclination or inspiration to write

		is with me yet i pause trying to decide which dream

		or thought to put place first...first place put the

		misfits, i had for years wanted to ear it and hear

		what it would yield, to see it and wear what it would

		yield...once upon a time, when i wrote the biographical

		story entitled baptism by desire, i visited a book shop

		where there was only one tome on clift and where the 

		clerk said why not ask eli wallach...i didn't realize

		he lived nearby although some time later i saw him

		while we both walked west end avenue but i was

		done with the story by then and i'm not one to 

		intrude...but the point is i went into the misfits

		last night...it's a good time too since back then 

		i would only have thought of clark gable as the 

		gone with the wind character unaware of his past,

		his genius past - i could say the same for john huston,

		which would only have registered as prizzi's honor but

		now especailly after seeing 1960s unforgiven there is 

		a more complete sense of what it means...still it wasn't

		the men...it was marilyn  and it was alot more monroe

		than say monkey business which is where i saw her last -

		now all the hoopla makes sense to me and i'm really excited

		to see the rest of it and to a lesser extent dirty angels...

		i wonder if this is the one where eva had to go through a 

		lawsuit...i wonder what wild stories john huston told

		arthur miller on the set of that production...correction

		i might have recalled that director as an actor in chinatown.

		sometime before that significant evening for myself, i had

		a point of confusion as to the brand of jacket lotta wore...

		in thinking of zara or mango i thought of saramago the scribe

		of 'blindness' and illustrated the uncertainty in commentized 

		form...i only bring it up because a minute ago the news reports

		the founder of mango fell off a cliff...for the obvious reason,

		i thought it weird but also for the fact that i thought mango

		was by penelope;s sister...night and the middle of the night hours

		crawled by lazy after a terrbily breezy day...turbo ily shadows

		while listening to the haunting of hill house...telegraph said

		cherry hill who would take up to seven years to build toy scale

		model steam trains had rolled on into what must be an intricate

		afterlife...theodora is not the easiest name for me to hear...

		then too the narrator when playing the professor sounds exactly

		like christopher waltz...listening to the dead play cold rain

		and snow...i'm going where those chilly winds don't blow...

		well literally this late morning although still not seeing

		the sky in dream i had this sensational adventure with lotta

		as if meeting her at the station, the one in sweden, although

		she is presently ingermany, yes it didn't feel cold or windy -

		like a man in a trance enchanted...i awoke amazed and even 

		after the post-rem slumber it remained with me so that i still

		feel elated...i'm sure you know the feeling wherein nothing

		else matters much so that for a minute or so life makes sense.

		i suppose it was the setting since there was only conversation

		while we made our way around...i've heard it often, location

		is everything but now i'm a believer. i can't believe west sofia

		started a gym, well pilates workout place...it's called reform

		avenue...here's wishing her well...very well then, alexandra

		seemed to insist on something in my imagination yet i could not

		decipher it - of course, being me i worry a bit although i know

		worrying is no help - i now think of ester exposito...yet my

		instinct was that someone was trying to invade her while 

		pretending to be me as i had not had such a bizarre and 

		forceful series of thoughts...in fact with alexandra it was

		and hopefully is always extremely pleasant and helpful in 

		the sense that she is the only person to ever make me 

		consider the importance of washing my face...the other

		day i was shocked at the dirt on the dickinson's witch

		hazel towel as i scrubbed my mug and thought of her with

		that oh you were so right in that sense...anyway subsequent

		to where i was i drifted away from worry which for a second

		turned bottomless with the previous concern of when her

		shift shipped her out to deliver a few months ago...yet 

		as i consider it now the contrast of those worries was 

		like night and day...perhaps it was all overthinking yet

		i certainly felt an undefined pressure as i drifted further

		away into sleep...i say all this because everyone is important

		in their right and especially girls need more safety in our

		illogical meat grinder rat race society...methinks, meanwhile

		i fully support sonia taking over pinsk and for that matter

		all of belarus...ah yes, that was the last time i dreamt of

		the sky. sigh. yes i know too much information but blame the

		tmi on the swedish dream that is still making me feel magical

		although i pulled no rabbit out of this convoluted paragraph

		hat.
		<br>
		15 december. the john huston film from 1960 did not disappoint,

		in fact i felt it went above and beyond what anyone would have

		or could expect...my high praise however stems from the inspiration

		i found in learning about horses...he actually entered a camel

		race in the middle of directing that movie and came in first

		place...i think of mia in tracks now which also featured a 

		dog, here it was tom dooley...character from a folk song...

		well, there was something poetic and poignant as the female

		lead stood on the plains away from the men calling them 

		murderers as if a ghost of herself foreshadowing her own

		spirit;s rant upon her death august fourth of the next

		year...they had wrapped november fourth...i could be a 

		critic against montgomery's performance yet having 

		studied his life and knowing he did suffer a horrific

		car crash only a few years previous it only made me 

		grimace and in some ways cheer for him even if i didn't

		feel any emotion other than curiosity from his performance,

		but i'd expect nerves would have played a part...

		it was two in the morning euro time and lotta was still

		editing her video...i went to sleep at three yet awoke

		at five...i dreamt i was in a bed sideways on the 

		lower side opposite the headboard - there was a girl 

		under the sheets i could not see yet felt like a friend,

		mother climbed into bed and she tickled her toes until

		mother covered them then we started holding hands, the

		girl and myself as mother started to speak about me getting

		married which led to my wisecrack that tiffany wanted to 

		marry me wherein suddenly i could see tiffany in the city

		riding a bike, a purse on the handlebars which she was adjusting

		and this shift in time and space felt entirely natural - 

		i get up to pee in the dream and the girl follows, the house

		i recognize as aunt's laly old house on castillo 36 - 

		i stand by the kitchen door which i have just opened yet

		the desire to pee has left me as i look at the view which

		contradicts location...there was only a guava tree back there

		yet in the dream housing buildings stood with some windows lit -

		the locks are interlaced pads and chains and ionly used the bolt

		leaving the mystery for someone else to figure out - the girl

		now wants to pee - but other family has arrived, one of them

		taking the bathroom perhaps for a bath...well shower since there

		was never a bathtub in that house - i think for a second it's

		kia jade yet i believe she's taller...we make our way into 

		the front porch where another aunt is dressed in white and red

		in fact they all were - one of the boys even seemed to be wearing

		a dress - i say it is like the so-called gypsy roma people and

		turning away from the sour faced cousin in the dress i start singing

		here comes the bride heading back inside finding myself between two

		ladies i do not recognize but one of them is really singing the song

		in full emotional voice, she reminds me for a second of lotta's mom

		but i do not know if she can carry a tune actually, in any case i turn

		to the other lady that i somehow know is a singer and mention how well

		the other lady is belting it out...i suppose i turn to finally see who

		i am with but awake in that very moment...moodys downgraded the french

		credit score and mayotte was battered by a cyclone...although bowie

		took up most of the space in me that would grieve over the loss of 

		a loved one, as i looked at van morrison and sinead oconner's duet of

		have i told you lately on the letterman show i could see vm's antics

		bring out the true sinead and in an instant one understands her

		contradition which was both shy yet outspoken, nervous yet filled

		with admiration and desire to bring joy to the world - indeed it

		was an angel we all lost too soon...so i say to contrast with

		my thoughts spurred on by the dream as to how much northern

		land the french side of my family gave up for the sake of 

		not going to paris...or more importantly who were the ones that

		left it...i miss that house, i miss all the houses that are no 

		longer ours...they were true homes even now in dreams like

		apartment 3k is and will be...but feeling i went over board 

		writing these notes yesterday i will leave it at that for now. 

		<br>
		post-script - well i can't say i entirely understood dirty

		angels, i mean it starts with eva green being stoned which

		gave me perhaps too much to think about...from religion to

		rainy day women...then that bloody shot of her swollen face,

		this is not the lawsuit film as that was never made, ie the

		lawsuit she won a few months ago...where was i - ah yes

		then in uniform - i really liked that - i even started

		thinking we should all wear military outfits...so an action

		film and in that sense it was all right...indeed, it kept

		me watching. my only protest here is the chosen song which

		leads into the fade out credits...some bland heavy metal

		which leaves you thinking what song is that...meybe they

		thought any rock would do to come full circle with the 

		thrown stones at the start...yes i am glossing over the
		
		importance of the political side but one peek at the news
		
		will tell you how timely it is...i haven't heard of any 

		upcoming eva green projects yet i hope there are some soon.

		meanwhile  i have secured 'maria' yet it all seems so quick;

		it really feels like a few days there was an article with

		angelina jolie in oversized glasses that said she was filming...

		how could it be cut and edited and released so swiftly...

		i went to sleep again after viewing lotta's vlog and i 

		was very happy to see her so full of joy...my dreams

		flew by in a flash and i awoke to an even happier lotta

		which made me update the landing page at inkrealm.info...

		skirt has, after clawing through the leather kitchen chair,

		taken to hanging out on the dining table...so will i be

		eating in bed? he's already used up the chair part of the

		ottoman set and now rarely takes to it...like a playboy

		except it's furniture instead of women...this was an 

		unexpectly eventful sunday - well it still is, even in

		european hours there are three left, while here there

		are seven or eight left...
		<br>
		16 december. i viewed 'maria' however i don't want to

		write about it...it tells so many stories all at once

		while actually reincarnating the voice of callas and

		vividly revealing the isolation that goes hand in hand

		with fame, (although some might argue that her hallucinations

		were due to drugs) that to speak of it even in praise

		could not serve it. it was early morning in asia

		when i went to sleep exhausted for no specific reason

		other than perhaps oversleeping...my thoughts curved

		between lotta and lauren sophia...i dreamt i was walking

		home, yet the new york city version, checking the mail

		where rows of mailboxes were missing as i went into the

		other side finding some old people with no answer as 

		to why it was like that...glass door sassy woman looked

		me over as i walked upstairs...key at the door turning

		as a man approaches intent on talking about some concert

		it seemed he knew i had gone too as well, not so many

		russians this time, he smirks and i say nothing and 

		i still remain silent as he insists on entering until

		i push him out and start to shut the door...marian 

		is inside and somehow this seems normal to me...two 

		of her friends then knock on the door and tell me

		their names, i repeat the names to her and she says

		she doesn't want to be with them, i take it that

		she is tired and relate the message offering to 

		pay for their taxi...marian gives me an 828 number

		and they give me an address in queens...for a minute

		the scene settles into only us yet quickly turns

		to us walking in a part od town that is a cross

		between the village and central park west...for

		some reason lotta is now with marian and showing

		her some kind of way to walk, i suppose it is 

		something models do...they seem to get along 

		better than with me...i am sort of pleased and

		happy that they are happy as i walk up central 

		park west, then lotta climbs up on me from behind

		making me go into a run and there i am running

		yet a few strides in i feel her leg and notice 

		she is not wearing shoes...this starts to wake me

		and i get up with my touch having got to her thigh...

		i am thinking of L'amour est un oiseau rebelle and 

		how she mentioned two girls had showed up in dusseldorf

		and perhaps that was what the dream was about but i am

		not certain what she meant, that is, it was german and

		it seemed to imply fangirls or some recognition from 

		what i understood...as i think of it more i suppose

		she is concerned over the meeting tomorrow promoting

		hejgreta...i know iwould be as a lot of company's make

		these events without too much thought about security...

		i remember being shocked at lara taking a taxi and making

		her way through the street and crowd to get to one...

		hmm, or worse lila wearing wings in midtown manhattan

		struggling through pedestrians along with other models...

		and those were big name fashion houses that could surely

		afford something better for their girls...oh wait this

		has gotten into an overboard groove and in technical 

		terms it is still yesterday here although lunch time

		in asian cities.
		<br>
		17 december. in a dream i seem to have gone out with 

		only a blanket swirled around my body and for some

		reason i walk into a bakery shop  or is more correct

		to call it a pastry shop...i thought about that pierre

		shop in wagen...it would take me while to see all the 

		pretty places i want to experience in germany...my 

		cousin would often awake like that, with the blanket

		instead of clothes...a modern day linus without the 

		piano or thumb sucking...i myself have raced to the 

		ringing phone dressed like that but only to not 

		stand naked in the living room...i decided to disregard

		the constant flow of news although i did take a stand on

		djerf wondering why women are trying to tear down a woman

		that carved out a place for herself in an impossible atmosphere...

		give em hell, matilda...yes this is partly because lotta

		likes that fashion but also i don't like the trial without

		due process or jury...that being the case i wont commentize

		on venom the last dance since i missed the second film of

		that movie trilogy...where was i...ah yes so i got a lot

		done even trimmed my toe nails...no news isnt good news

		yet it leaves a bit more space for self...i did glance

		at the wisconsin situation twice given that the star 

		of that sitcom was named natalie samantha rupnow, 

		a woman, well, a girl...amazing...i had not heard

		of female mass murderers...massage place with that

		name 2053 Detlor Rd, L'Amable, ON K0L 1C0, Canada...

		dennis thomas rupnow passed away 28 october '23,

		david ernst rupnow 4 january '22...not a common

		name but several other obits - not sure if any relate

		to her...a kid in the second grade telephoned the 

		report to authorities...honda made the nsr500 until

		2002...there are at least two agencies with the 

		abbreviation of NSR...i will peek later to see if 

		anything more might be said over this tragic or sad

		turn of events...such a nice place, madison wis...

		wish dream resulted in weird dream as mother

		was here again having let in some people that moved

		things around and so i argued until things were in

		place then in the balcony an old man had put an even

		older woman in a sort of brenda lien call of cuteness

		cat sock and i put both out into the staircase all the 

		while asking who was who as the man responded...salami

		people the size of plantains...a lot of it in spanish

		so i suspect the result of an onlooker...my right foot

		in a slow painful spasm as if i had actually been racing

		around putting the place in order...she keeps saying

		she gets up thinking she is here or that she has dreamt

		about being here...i had no idea i was such a pleasant

		host...i do have an idea that printing these notes

		looks as if it were writing yet it is not...it's not

		that i am not considering readers, no, it is more like

		what i do with musical scales...a ritual except here

		there's nothing to contain a random thought and dreams

		well, dreams are what they are...hopefully as might be

		the case in mastering notes, these unedited paragraphs

		will serve as a base or starting point for other projects...

		i'm not promising, only saying. that being said, i will

		try be more concise down the line.
