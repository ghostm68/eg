        <h1>dreamweaver two</h1>
        <p>
         23 october 2024 oh to redeploy this on a smurf anniversary. i think i should have waited until the 30th,
		ezra pound day, or even november...yet there is a lot on my mind and writing is what i do...
		pelevin does not write in fact he puzzles over a position, sometimes in brilliant fashion,
		until drowning it with a sort of too much information for his readers to process...in my
		experience the nearest example for contrast would be phillip k dick...

		the writer had recently completed notes for a novel and was told pdk shopped
		at happy dog for horse meat when he was struggling to survive hence horselover fat...

		that is to say it is the type of style one encounters in valis except amped up as if
		the loudness allowed more freedom of speech i suppose...

		subsequently i read the horse stealers by anton chekhov...

		let's see before i delve deeper...i have decided to not include the preceeding notes,
		themselves possibly a book or two, these should stand on their own and if any reader
		would like them well i would not refuse a request to package them up and send them 
		through...

		my point is that writing freely should not be mistaken with writing for free, life
		is not free and even awful writing is paid...case in point, colleen hoover...

		or do women usually follow men into new york city restrooms after the author
		picks at bulgokov's entrance...

		ahem. i never realized how good lecarre was until reading his first novel which
		was perfection save for the jewess's confession and the ending list in any case
		miles above the film version which kept the wife as self-described nymphomaniac
		slut in a redundant twist that must've made john's head spin...

		yes i know too much prelude for dream notes and so here goes; 

		hurricane milton followed helene and i was haunted by the control weather brim skit 
		as many others thought the democrats were trying to smash the hard core red state
		voters to gain those delegates, those delicate votes...

		one ukrainian and his family got swallowed in florida after escaping the so-called
		war...the appointment in samara fleshed out with full irony...

		within my own contradictions i dreamt of a topless cousin and eating cake -
		later seeing her arrive with other girls...hadnt thought of her much since
		she never invited me to her wedding and later that evening i had a clear vision
		of her bed...excuse me i am not looking for parking, in fact i don't have a vehicle...

		the man mom married passed away on the same day as jack kerouac had, which was about the
		time she moved to the states over the hills and far away...

		something kept trying to connect me with him and i even felt it scan memory as if
		to say aha or even make it my demise...i was starting to even feel dizzy sick until
		james cagney directed shortcut to hell...

		i'm with zelda in france at some art class and it feels as natural as being
		with joan in england pub except one of them was taking my picture and i had not
		shaved and tried to hide my stubble as it were...

		floating in my apartment as if visiting myself - the cat is on one of the beds -

		finding myself in a car being kissed by ava and her triangle tongue, later
		speaking with zofia...

		a man was handing me a great variety of two dollar bills, i watched flightplan
		again and catchfire, how does one forget nudity - perhaps when the talent
		is so overwhelming that what remains is the method not the madness -

		loro was a real revelation and i had no answer to my own question, if you liked
		youth so much why not seek out other films by that director...

		the family friend was no let down, even thrilling once in a while -

		meanwhile the box of things minus the requested samsonite case i asked for
		which was sent out in june finally arrived in october...

		i was much more satisfied by the substance, i keep looking back at it amazed
		at its form...

		reminded after of the girl i walk'd some with - down riverside drive...

		dress as if meant to be recalled...packing suitcase as marlon talks -

		i think he was recording to tape also...talk of order, standing in line

		french fries conspiracy - a finger at my lip - what does the sticker say?

		two million dollars carrying a girl inside a movie theatre - someone is tracking

		us - i think of laura sophia instead of lotta, fresh air - i'm standing at the 

		entrance of a mansion, in fact i think i only dreamt of lotta once...in any

		case i recite the phone number that pre-dates me and is yet active -

		there are two women one undressed and bleeding it seems like menstruation

		unfiltered and left without washing but it is all so fast i cannot focus

		and awake like when walking on aluminum foil landscape - was it bird or insect

		at window suddenly mixed by chirp or crawling sound within me...not sure

		yet i was trying to escape...i cannot escape my lost apartment, there i 

		am with mother painting the hall i am going to my room convinced that my

		date is not coming, but the girl arrives wearing a pleated skirt which she

		raises in front of me as if to make me get up...there is an indian statue 

		with the word nadie or nadia and i like it deciding to put place it on

		my dresser...it wears a dark shawl, i start thinking they also did not 

		send my japanese cat statue...so when did i actually start to weep? well,

		during dominique when the boy dies protecting the girl oksana left in 

		a chained padlock light switch room...not that i'm the action packed type

		but someone called asking for leidsa numbers i think i said 34, 76,

		and 91...nobody called in terms of condolences. 
		
		(one call from an aunt followed this typing,

		which inspired me to invent a man who had

		a toaster for an ass which needed to be plugged in)
		
		alina sent nude pictures. (possible email scam

		but as a gentleman i try to reply pleasantly)

		i only cry in the movies and even if i spend the day smoking i never light
		
		up a cigarette in dreams...
		<br>
		<br>

		0ctober 24...dreams like visitations - well, visions to be precise...
		
		i had received a phone call, a nearly unusual event these days...

		so there was more talk than what has become ordinary - i suppose that

		along with texting went a ways into overwhelming my senses - 

		i went to sleep at the second hour after midnight thinking of

		book titles and elvis costello - one of us is lying...i get what

		feels like a locked car in the sun temperature or perhaps a sun

		soaked roof feeling and get up to let in fresh air and pour

		water on myself...when i finally get to sleep i dream that i am

		naked on my bed and someone starts speaking...i cover myself and

		feel cool enough not to wonder or worry since it is a know face -

		still, there is something about it upon reflection that is disturbing;

		this all becomes some sort of party, i wonder how long it takes

		to fly from warsaw to tel aviv but alexandra is actually flying to

		new york - there is now a group of people mainly girls - one of them

		remninds me of helena's jeans under a tied christian dior shirt

		she pulled on like you would a t-shirt...buttons must feel she does

		not like them enough to unbutton and so forth...well in the dream 

		it is not her, someone more spanish although possibly not spain -

		lotta hinted that she had a greatly good time in mallorca yet i 

		have not witnessed the recording myself...in the dream i feel

		drained while the woman in those specific jeans looks to be in 

		an orgasmic convulsion as if possessed like a spirit is making 

		love her or at least nibble kissing her neck yet no one is near

		and worse everyone acts as if nothing is going down...i must have 

		got up at some point and am standing in the crowd studying her -

		she has another fit in the epilepsy style except this time she

		is intent on reaching the source of her frantic excitement - 

		as she exits i see two men on a bed, there is a tv on and a

		laptop also on next it...i say something about turning at least

		one of them off and they don't disagree...i awake right after

		to find that i only slept a couple of hours...i jot the basics

		of the scenes, fill the bath with water and ivory and hope

		i can catch some more minutes of sleep and or dreams that make

		more sense before i slip into coffee and internet and such...

		thursday is rising fast and my only plan is to go through my

		scales especially the two new ones i keep mixing up - not certain

		why arabic translates in thought as if enigmatic and vice versa...

		(my ritual is now at eighteen scales, one of them

		my own hybrid creation...)

		ps. did more sleep did sleep more yet maybe too much...seen mallorca

		except she seemed more content in the paradoxe...i recalled another

		scene wherein some child dislodged a lens from my frames...i pick

		it up to see if it can be returned to place but it is shattered

		and much larger...dolce gabanna it actually happened in the city

		without a kid just a sliver missing, glasses i still wear...well,

		outside as for some reason i took to not wearing eyewear at home -

		meanwhile london and i never understood how sarcastic daniel's

		face could be but i mean that in a goodly way...expression, some

		faces need no words to communicate...lotta communicates eye patches

		in stories yet her puffy morning eyes are when i think she looks

		exquisitely beautiful...but now i know prada preceeded the perfume

		in dusseldorf...alison james wrote wilhemina tempest's obituary -

		 “We are such stuff as dreams are made on, and our little life is 
		
		rounded with a sleep.”

		i have inclinations to continue to employ the pen at ASDBL and

		even the alaska experiment yet it is not pressing, it is like

		ideas or notions i wonder if i should augment with...obviously

		wilhemina bring this to mind as i'm not sure if i made it clear

		enough that she branches out from the source muse character to

		another yes that and the fact that i think it might be good

		to list all the types of horses perhaps in a glossary as

		burroughs did with drugs...there is actually a buzz as if

		i am getting high on my own writing...

		 “You taught me language, and my profit on’t is,
		
		I know how to curse.”

		<br>
		<br>

		25 october -

		friday the funeral I did not attend or intend to go to...

		in speaking to the widow about my reasons, the point arose

		in mind's irony...well i had a dream that i was standing

		in a funeral ceremony viewing myself in the coffin...

		i said it was about the age of twelve but most likely it

		was later as it impressed me so that it was among the 

		first attempts at literature...the dream is true however

		the fear of it is not...i stayed up much later than 

		i wanted, getting up several times to make soup and 

		and to make coffee and even again to seduce the hunger

		into submission with a slice of bread...there was an 

		emptiness i could not explain...let us call it an invasion -

		a mystical raid that later even extended into language as a

		foreign song tried to spin around my head...

		it was late morning by the time i got to sleep, the hours

		herein reflect a european time zone - 

		early evening awoke from dreams that found me in a 

		modern building - the office type - i am trying to

		get a pair of shoes fixed and i am told by a woman

		where i could get that done...as i approach the elevator

		it shuts and slides down yet i hear someone say they

		will bring it back which nearly instantly they do as

		i then find myself holding a pair of adidas...it is

		an elevator operator like in a recent instyle story

		reel which lucy was in...i suppose it came to mind

		and there i am with her but it is like a pastry shop

		where i lose sight of her and start unwrapping and

		tasting and returning the sweets to their place wrapped, 
		
		as the voice of some other women recommends, i like the taste

		or perhaps i have not satisfied the weird hunger...

		i think to get some for the widow and the dream ends.

		i had viewed a japanese film, kubi, which is said to be

		about events in 1582...although crowded with bloody

		scenes and even a careless view of homosexuality or 

		if you prefer a degrading view of women
		
		(which should prove shocking enough to most),it still did not

		have that centerpiece alike hellboy the crooked man

		wherein the snake exits the girl's down there parts

		and slithers up into her mouth...the most striking 

		moment was the "delicious" poisoned snapper irony. 

		if only they could have bought dean martin's ain't

		that a kick in the head for the final credits.

                12 november...was it lennon, life is waht happens

		when you are busy making other plans...i did not

		intend to have to wait so long for a dream that

		made sense enough to put place into words...

		although i know the experience as commonplace to

		myself when under the influence of weed wherein

		dreams are so light they carry no weight in memory...

		meanwhile i kept cleaning house...i view'd several

		many more films, most recently thunderball, man woman 

		or teen was that tom jones belting out the theme...

		sean sucking claudine's foot...she was in a genius 

		bikini...in the dream it was evening and within that

		night the rain poured down in storm-fashion...the times

		wroted 'trump storms back' as if it wasnt enough to 

		have stuck their neck out on the silly endorsement they

		seemed to go with a cheap daniels jape...

		i remember i went shopping for a fan - thinking it sort

		of proved that 2020 was replete, filled with fraud...

		people, in the dream scene were running, crowds of them, 

		through the shadow of trees above where i walked which

		was a roadway, a woman was with me as we decided to hail 

		a taxi, japanese contraption spied letting out a customer

		and i got in as the girl vanished - a very little man 

		drove but on the side as one might find in those sidekick

		motorcycle - another man without pickles kept nearing 

		from the front i faced as if searching me for something -

		i searched through sofia's first well second failed film

		which is called priscilla, first girl i ever kissed in 

		some childhood lobby uptown, it starts ramones perfect

		directer by spector but i felt the cast did not resemble

		the reality, even graceland looked like an apartment not

		a mansion, vegas scene was nice, the hinted los angeles

		ending was cool yet like the book burning it didnt capture

		the impact...no elvis songs in the soundtrack sure was

		shocking...yes i know easy to monday morning quarterback
		
		pick apart and yes obviously a great amount of effort

		went into it...hopefully she will get back to form in 

		her next scenes...the driver did not want to go to 

		bella vista and i had to agree to be let out as near

		to my destination as he could manage...i awoke before

		getting anywhere, gabby got published with nowhere, usa

		and i was very happy for her without agreeing that the

		midwest is hell...or even frozen although i know poetic 

		language is what language cannot be...robert graves,

		the white goddess, a reading that makes me feel the 

		limit of my own recall. thousands of stories and 

		connections which are impossible to memorize...

		embraced it awake and held it asleep...one understands

		some of the major points, the intent, let us call it

		the premise...in itself a duality that aims to prove and

		provoke yet in the build up of facts and circumstantial

		evidence there is a dizzy sort of who or what question

		as the whirlwind spins into a series of explorations...

		i agree somewhat - not with the style - but with the 

		concept and feel especially thrilled that there is 

		no pop quiz at the end of this bizarre masterpiece. 

		the jews agree; the body should be buried...the outrun,

		say or see never looked so beautiful yet how could such

		an intelligent character be so dumb? well, drinking 

		does kill brain cells, they say...did love the ending. 

		these are not movie recommendations, merely notes for

		i know not what exactly except by definition as a writer 

		i scribble into the constant illusion of now...

		the past presents itself in emilee form again the run,

		in the book he mentions witches running around a place 

		nine times to cast a spell or the mirror walk behind

		the cursed one so their prat fall results in the stumble -

		there's a little girl, so precious and pretty, i am sure

		it is an illusion but i explain that yes i am keeping

		my promise to the extent that no masked intruder could

		make a fool of me...for a minute i wanted to believe 

		michael was innocent but then i asked myself and even

		ai what other man ever asked to sleep with someone's

		child nevermind the box of porn under the bed...

		ah yes, ready or not - a real modern classic with

		spontanous combustion...dear me i liked that one alot,

		in some ways a sort of documentary i felt for myself

		as i sometimes believe my family has always been out

		to rub out or switch off my dream girl...maternal

		grandmother being the exception, i digress...not meaning

		to have such a word count here dear readers if i have

		any other dream to report you will find it here...

		please note - warner brothers/level is pulling the

		plug on two skinny girls...i could remove the 

		catalog now but why would i? so i am letting it happen

		so it will be on their heads not mine and re-uploading

		the songs after that point. hopefully there won't

		be much downtime but so you know it is not a glitch

		in the streaming services or outlets circa 18 november

		and beyond. 

		<br>
		<br>
		
                13 november dream fading upon waking possibly eva green
		
		or lotta stichler, the knit sweater taking longer than
		
		i expected, the idea of twin sister sure is interesting-
		
		not so interesting is the day's unusual diet dessert
		
		flan on top of leftover chinese and two almond cupcakes -
		
		it's like being drowsy drunk on food...fueled with never

		say never again where sean returns to bookend the remake

		i make thoughts on megapolis, as i revist the ending 

		of the white goddess wherein graves gives the devil his due

		as it were...my bath so cold i yelped -

		where was i oh yes this one is not easy, i hope it is

		like depalma scarface which i couldnt understand until a second viewing,

		but i boubt it as this seems to require the faith of an inner child

		yet it is precisely achild in the role of an assassin...

		elvis impersonator felt weird unless one thinks of his daughter -

		my fued with it can be in the sum of two points;

		that lead actress seemed to be pulled from the cast of show girls

		and dud did not transmit emotions required for empathy and

		morpheus stands around as if he had really been killed

		in the apocalypse now boat a walking zombie also doing voice 

		over keeping in mind that he can memorize shakespeare

		it must have been the easiest role he ever learnt

		but if vourse iyt is not a movie...it is a family affair

		 a warning and a prayer with deliverance arrows

		my firs thought was oh no not a happy ending

		sensed tears at the dedication to wife

		once he was going to forget everythint he had learned

		and write like he was a teen, perhaps that is what 

		we have seen...director's cut? classified

		wondering why aaron kept leaving the fire arms released

		along with the extended version of caligula well

		woman of the hour had something, that is how wrong 

		we can be in judging...anyway i was hoping for a 

		sort of youth without youth vibe but maybe next time -

		at least there was a real sense of new york city in

		the apprentice...pre-disney manhattan might have been

		the message in me gap ol is...ford to city drop...

		of course the issue with outstanding acting ie

		the critic is that one starts rooting for the villainous 

		character...irony will drown us all...

		i tear up the picture of the fat man of the week

		tv show interview the dearly departed had done 

		finding it alone in a scrap book never started -

		i play my scales over the film concentrating on

		the gypsy...now thinking that's what dylan called

		elvis staying in a big hotel smiling as he appreached

		saying well well...i try to take a nap but the nap

		takes me further into thinking with the national

		soundtrack of ymca village folk rising in nonsense

		echoing...young mens christian association...

		maybe it will help jerry lee's cousin jimmy...

		maybe i have overdosed on film...certainly

		on porn...some other position postultes 

		god in the volcano or zeus...some of it makes

		sense and it gives me pause...perhaps i have to

		revisit joseph campbell's ideas...tomorrow and

		tomorrow alexander the great is named pharaoh

		but that 332BC, not because but before it's fun

		to stay at the why have we not been there...

		<br>
		<br>

		14 november

		i'd felt outside my self all day as if waiting
		
		for the evening and the i'd felt the evening
		
		was not waiting for me...

		they say the berlin ruling system collapsed,
		
		they say dw union is on a two day strike...

		maybe i was locked in a teledisco booth -

		some of the monkeys were given fruit loops...

		in terms of entertainment, i should have mentioned

                finally catching up with the second parts of 

		ahs 12 as well as american horror stories. 

		emma, have i got a story for you concerning

		the ambulance birth...but i didn't get why

		wear the bitch's headgear?

		otherwise i liked the liminal spaces idea

		but i really have an insnae bias against

		blubbler so i could hardly enjoy the 

		last part of the stories which should have

		brought to mind asylum season, yeah i was

		more worried that the buttons of her blouse

		were going to fly off into the the other

		actress's face...

		pre dream pissing on lotta's face...

		walking through the chelsea hotel thinking

		of the brazilian girl i went there with

		willy deville singing to walk that girl home...

		minutes or moments later it's all pretty dark

		and i seem to be without a body hovering or

		hooked up with some woman on amsterdam avenue

		who is upset over the drug dealers that stand

		around in fron of the shop she's trying to 

		get into...i hear the vague outline of her

		voice arguing against them and they seem 

		to be replicas of each other even in the

		way they are dressed...i don't know where

		this dream went - i get up too early but

		take a minute or a moment for cigarettes

		coffee and this note...marian is on my 

		mind as i give skirt the party mix eats...

		there's a text message about a wallet and

		it nearly derails all the details of the

		dreaming but as i type i start to recall

		the strange door dreams, three k where

		i find cheese and nickel bags thinking 

		to snack and go back to my room and puff

		when it sounded like someone was at the

		entrance...other door dream opening but

		then it does not fit like three quarters

		of it only which left a slender opening...

		here door a motley gang of men insisting

		that i am having a soiree and wanting to

		come in and celebrate as i stand there

		baffled and nearly upset...i had lined

		the back door with litre glasses of 

		coca cola bottles, but it was the front

		door. people are strange when you're a

		stranger should have been played.

		seven in the morning sweden, one in the

		morning here, eleven in the evening los

		angeles. this ain't the mud club or cbgb's...

		early afternoon in asian towns, sounds like

		monkey genocide in thailand...valencia might

		re-flood with evacuations underway, i hope

		padam padam is a hit but there is no logical

		way to juggle time zones...

	
		<br>
		<br>

		23 november...so much has gone down and yet 

		not much has happened...arrival of guest and

		groovy haul - my habit was to always buy one

		nice shirt when possible but i find myself with

		five new shirts all at once...

		a weird luxury. some rich dreams too yet

		mostly disintegrating as the waking thoughts

		rattle me up to serve breakfast and start the

		day...a few weeks ago i was very happy that

		lucy  was going to film in rome, i think

		where fellini worked out his scenese, and 

		i sure did have a dream wherein we were very

		friendly as if rejoicing yet lotta  had

		gone to new york and mentioned a girl named

		giulia which then made me think it might have

		been her in the dream...not much time for

		sleep as i don't allow my guest to cook or

		clean...but this is no complaint or protest...

		i play the substance everyday, today will be

		the fifth time...in fact i am looking forward 

		to it...there's a week or so left of this 

		"visiting" and i will try to report on the

		proceedings as soon as possible...posed

		one of the "taken down" songs and it was 

		a spirit breaking experience...the cover was

		not accepted since they require very specific

		dimensions, so my lock and key artwork went

		by the wayside for some stock image...then

		the exported catalog is all in wav files but

		this requires mp3 or flac...it was for -low fi-

		and they require at least one foreign language

		metadata and i chose traditional chinese which

		then had to be augmented by simplified chinese...

		i could not imagine doing this for thirty songs...

		would you? the lyrics of it's a long way to the top

		if you want to rock and roll never mentioned such

		tedious work involved in getting one's music out...

		for reference; (low fi)<br>
<br>
		the sun drives across my skinq<br>
sweeter than a nevervous breakdown

nobody in the human race<br>

----- chords

f major 5...
-------<br>

well, stuck inside of mobile with the memphis blues again did

	sort of say there was some sort of repetition involved

		in the "creative" process; smoking eyelids

		and punched cigarettes...

ashes when i have tray time i will see if there is another

way to get the other songs out in the format they already have...

i listened to it again thinking sure it's not a hit but it is not

run of the mill...usually it's books that go out of print...

to have this happen to songs is beyond bizarre...

sort of like gogol's the nose! 

well, here's wishing you all a decent thanksgiving. <br>

		27 november...i dreamt yesterday that iwas

		flying to to europe from the states...germany

		i suppose as that is a recurring scene in my

		dream mind...in this case the airport and 

		luggage were all very detailed - someone was 

		speaking as if asking questions, not sure what

		i said...did recall a pre-dream nightmare

		wherein i am talking to my sister as if

		hypnotized...she had actually dropped by -

		then again yesterday with her motley crew...

		went to sleep late smoking and wondering why

		lotta was still in new york...i dreamt playing

		guitar with the stones and trying to figure out

		some song about a feline in the key of c major...

		i got up early feeling tired all day - but it was

		rainy and i rather enjoy the downpour...she got

		miu miu eyewear and was on her way to the plane...

		i actually have not taken the time for notes or

		chords although i did make a leather strap for

		the ibanez...the idea was that not playing my

		daily scales would help her in some way...silly 

		yet it satisfied something in my thoughts...

		or more correctly in my superstition - 

		anyway i am looking ahead to getting back in 

		rhythm tomorrow...besides, in skipping the 

		thanksgiving shingdig, i will have the evening

		all to my self, well myself and skirt...

		had not heard the song flight 505, well five

		days left of hosting after tomorrow  as the 

		guest leaves early on the first week of december.

		word to the wise, don't dare miss say or see 

		singing one of the blitz songs in the studio, 

		it is exceptional or to kick at madonna's nerves

		some; it is neat. 

		<br>
		30 november...weird watery dream wherein there 

		was a screen embedded into the faucet handel

		of the shower...it resembled one of those

		ancient portable tv screens but smaller...

		invention dream; shower faucets with media 

		screens...

		hmm...then of course i did not have a free

		thanksgiving as my guest decided not to go out -

		at least the lions won...memories of detroit 

		swirled in thought...then further into childhood

		and my jacket...they have never gone all way -

		i really liked that jacket...you gotta lose

		your mind in detroit rock city...billy idol

		covered bob dylan's if not for you, i heard

		grace slick talking and was amazed by her 

		honesty - but how is time magazine ten dollars?

		back to scales, felt no lapse. guest did venture

		out to visit someone else and so i do have part 

		of taday free...in a moment of idk browsed the 

		perlude to moby dick and thought melville had

		influenced me more than i realized...lotta left

		via  gate 65 and arrived, an hour late, via gate

		66...i thought the detail was quirky...lauren 

		got a ritual candle and robyn erased her kill 

		bill halloween pictures which i now miss...

		third day of pizza but my stomach has been sensitive

		for two days...i didn't expect, at this point, any 

		dream recall at all yet last night the scenes were

		pretty particular - as if i had married virginia 

		and one of her children was even calling me daddy...

		then moving into an apartment which was more like 

		a mailbox building or perhaps the locker in the 

		substance where the packages are delivered...

		everything seemed so compact...i always feel this

		place itself is too big for one person but i like

		the options of several rooms...in the one room 

		dream i sensed sister invading thought as she had

		said she was going to an apartment hotel for the

		weekend and when this happens i always wonder which

		one of her known relations has slipped into my place

		as if i were him or the like? well they are scheduled

		to leave on tuesday as well as my guest...
		
                great fun with the story of the fruit vendor who

		sold a banana which was used to make art and then

		eaten by a millionaire...that antique song that

		said bananas have to ripen in a special comes to 

		mind...cheers.
		<br>
		december one
		<br>
		sunday - i first heard it within everyone says i love

		you...marshall brickman gone at eighty five...nap

		snapped into song, 'i got a notion to love you 

		all day' heard it as if had already been wroted...

		dream in the park i talk too much and can't think of

		what to say then say, i contain multitudes, which is

		a song that was alredy wroted yet i only have a vague

		memory of it since i concentrated on murder most foul

		and later on key west philosopher pirate...

		this was not intended to segue from herman, but such

		is life...late at night a flood of emotions resolving

		in hunger that made me get up again for bread and

		ironically coffee...awoke minutes before nine - dream

		lotta's mother seemingly setting up lunch or some 

		meal in a very exact way...i'm not sure, but it was

		pretty impressive and for a minute i wondered trying

		to figure out the scene aside from inner intuition 

		what it was about...like a self interview, is she

		telling me something, i usually don't eat much but

		there is no need to set up a table meal, i should

		get up and look after my guest, it seems dark but

		the foil on the windows doesnt let the sun in, if

		it is lotta's mother then why do i feel attracted,

		oh no i am excited, now how am i going to explain this...

		the misfits is on prime. i'm in the middle of grand hotel,

		i've been in the middle of it ever since the guest arrived...

		the list of films was updated but my viewing list is now

		way overdue...nothing can be done about til tuesday...

		<br>
		monday two december <br>

		after waking up way too early, i returned to sleep, 

		and woke up a bit late...i'd been thinking about

		presidential pardons and sir elton john's eyes...

		my guest continually invites me to new york...

		i suppose it makes me dream of the city. well,

		the parts that i know...you cannot actually know

		a town like that...every few streets might be 

		like entering a different country...even the

		seemingly empty spaces like tenth avenue on the

		west side or york avenue on the east are entirely

		different types of desolation...one feels industrial

		and the latter feels richly secluded even like a 

		suburb - at least that is my feeling. i suppose

		it was more in the middle, in the mid town area

		perhaps right below columbus circle...i sense the

		crowd and the countless lights, some woman asks me

		if i am drug dealer...i think only dh marks fits

		into that category...how many names bring back 2016...

		too many. i say no, quickly thinking of the ad,

		say no to dr-ugs and hoping that at least some of

		my stories and songs are addictive. meanwhile the

		cinema list has surpassed two thousand five hundred

		titles with additions from the silvia pinal filmography.

		mexican film has not had a good day in years, my favorite

		is el esqueleto de la senora morales...
		<br>
		december 4. pre departure dream sitting knees up on the
		
		the floor beside the conclusion of some sort of trap-door

		slide where a girl gently crashes into me, i could see she

		had arrived with someone else yet he vanished and we lay

		there with sort of embraced legs, it felt like until i 

		went seemingly backwards into the trap-door and down

		with a falling naked feeling which was suddenly dressed

		and dressed again by what i can only describe as mail

		bag pouches with a much softer material...say they were

		heavy cotton yet these were soft linen with the same 

		sand coloring although neither beige nor tan...

		subsequently my guest left. given that it was mom,

		well, it sure seemed to be her once in a while, i

		felt utterly alone. weird how one can get used to 

		living by one's self yet seeing and serving another

		underlines the desolation, redefines it...ruins the

		illusion of what it means to be content...the girl in

		the scene i thought was kia, in other scenes there

		are other people in the house and mom is cleaning to

		which i react in opposition against the mop...stomping

		on one fellow as if a wrestling match...last night

		dreaming of walking down a road the type that is 

		sleek asphalt yet surrounded by forest...strangers

		gathered, surrounded...for some reason i argued that

		i could not be detained because i needed to get back

		to help mother. i felt danger in the outnumbered

		position like a dying man circled by vultures...

		i cleaned my room which had been neglected for 

		cleaning the rest of the apartment, i learned the

		word semiotics which i don't like and will possibly

		never use in conversation...i learned the chords

		of a song for you and heard the story of how sir

		elton john saved leon russell from the ditch on 

		the road of life...yet it seems he was supposed

		to be a sort of underground giant, i mean even 

		as much music as i hear, i only met his songs

		because i searched out will the circle be unbroken

		once upon a time a few months ago...strange. 

		i suppose bertrand and later kurt possessed the

		name so fully that no one else has a shot with it...

		in a dream i am working and a girl is trying to 

		get me to continue working without pay and in return

		she will flash me her tits fifty thousand times giving

		me an example preview...pink red nipples i could

		hardly remember her face thereafter as she turned

		away leaving me with the image of her chest...a man

		starts speaking perhaps asking if it is a deal but

		i think i only start making excuses...later shopping

		but also sweeping dirt from the floor...something

		is missing from the items i ordered at the last place

		and another woman is shwoing me the options...eight

		o'clock closing in on nine now...my to do list involves
		
		eating, taking out the trash, and laundry...hopefully 
		
		everyone else is gearing up for christmas the only

		x-rated holiday that isn't sexual.
