        <h1>dreamweaver two</h1>
        <p>
         23 october 2024 oh to redeploy this on a smurf anniversary. i think i should have waited until the 30th,
		ezra pound day, or even november...yet there is a lot on my mind and writing is what i do...
		pelevin does not write in fact he puzzles over a position, sometimes in brilliant fashion,
		until drowning it with a sort of too much information for his readers to process...in my
		experience the nearest example for contrast would be phillip k dick...

		the writer had recently completed notes for a novel and was told pdk shopped
		at happy dog for horse meat when he was struggling to survive hence horselover fat...

		that is to say it is the type of style one encounters in valis except amped up as if
		the loudness allowed more freedom of speech i suppose...

		subsequently i read the horse stealers by anton chekhov...

		let's see before i delve deeper...i have decided to not include the preceeding notes,
		themselves possibly a book or two, these should stand on their own and if any reader
		would like them well i would not refuse a request to package them up and send them 
		through...

		my point is that writing freely should not be mistaken with writing for free, life
		is not free and even awful writing is paid...case in point, colleen hoover...

		or do women usually follow men into new york city restrooms after the author
		picks at bulgokov's entrance...

		ahem. i never realized how good lecarre was until reading his first novel which
		was perfection save for the jewess's confession and the ending list in any case
		miles above the film version which kept the wife as self-described nymphomaniac
		slut in a redundant twist that must've made john's head spin...

		yes i know too much prelude for dream notes and so here goes; 

		hurricane milton followed helene and i was haunted by the control weather brim skit 
		as many others thought the democrats were trying to smash the hard core red state
		voters to gain those delegates, those delicate votes...

		one ukrainian and his family got swallowed in florida after escaping the so-called
		war...the appointment in samara fleshed out with full irony...

		within my own contradictions i dreamt of a topless cousin and eating cake -
		later seeing her arrive with other girls...hadnt thought of her much since
		she never invited me to her wedding and later that evening i had a clear vision
		of her bed...excuse me i am not looking for parking, in fact i don't have a vehicle...

		the man mom married passed away on the same day as jack kerouac had, which was about the
		time she moved to the states over the hills and far away...

		something kept trying to connect me with him and i even felt it scan memory as if
		to say aha or even make it my demise...i was starting to even feel dizzy sick until
		james cagney directed shortcut to hell...

		i'm with zelda in france at some art class and it feels as natural as being
		with joan in england pub except one of them was taking my picture and i had not
		shaved and tried to hide my stubble as it were...

		floating in my apartment as if visiting myself - the cat is on one of the beds -

		finding myself in a car being kissed by ava and her triangle tongue, later
		speaking with zofia...

		a man was handing me a great variety of two dollar bills, i watched flightplan
		again and catchfire, how does one forget nudity - perhaps when the talent
		is so overwhelming that what remains is the method not the madness -

		loro was a real revelation and i had no answer to my own question, if you liked
		youth so much why not seek out other films by that director...

		the family friend was no let down, even thrilling once in a while -

		meanwhile the box of things minus the requested samsonite case i asked for
		which was sent out in june finally arrived in october...

		i was much more satisfied by the substance, i keep looking back at it amazed
		at its form...

		reminded after of the girl i walk'd some with - down riverside drive...

		dress as if meant to be recalled...packing suitcase as marlon talks -

		i think he was recording to tape also...talk of order, standing in line

		french fries conspiracy - a finger at my lip - what does the sticker say?

		two million dollars carrying a girl inside a movie theatre - someone is tracking

		us - i think of laura sophia instead of lotta, fresh air - i'm standing at the 

		entrance of a mansion, in fact i think i only dreamt of lotta once...in any

		case i recite the phone number that pre-dates me and is yet active -

		there are two women one undressed and bleeding it seems like menstruation

		unfiltered and left without washing but it is all so fast i cannot focus

		and awake like when walking on aluminum foil landscape - was it bird or insect

		at window suddenly mixed by chirp or crawling sound within me...not sure

		yet i was trying to escape...i cannot escape my lost apartment, there i 

		am with mother painting the hall i am going to my room convinced that my

		date is not coming, but the girl arrives wearing a pleated skirt which she

		raises in front of me as if to make me get up...there is an indian statue 

		with the word nadie or nadia and i like it deciding to put place it on

		my dresser...it wears a dark shawl, i start thinking they also did not 

		send my japanese cat statue...so when did i actually start to weep? well,

		during dominique when the boy dies protecting the girl oksana left in 

		a chained padlock light switch room...not that i'm the action packed type

		but someone called asking for leidsa numbers i think i said 34, 76,

		and 91...nobody called in terms of condolences. 
		
		(one call from an aunt followed this typing,

		which inspired me to invent a man who had

		a toaster for an ass which needed to be plugged in)
		
		alina sent nude pictures. (possible email scam

		but as a gentleman i try to reply pleasantly)

		i only cry in the movies and even if i spend the day smoking i never light
		
		up a cigarette in dreams...

		0ctober 24...dreams like visitations - well, visions to be precise...
		
		i had received a phone call, a nearly unusual event these days...

		so there was more talk than what has become ordinary - i suppose that

		along with texting went a ways into overwhelming my senses - 

		i went to sleep at the second hour after midnight thinking of

		book titles and elvis costello - one of us is lying...i get what

		feels like a locked car in the sun temperature or perhaps a sun

		soaked roof feeling and get up to let in fresh air and pour

		water on myself...when i finally get to sleep i dream that i am

		naked on my bed and someone starts speaking...i cover myself and

		feel cool enough not to wonder or worry since it is a know face -

		still, there is something about it upon reflection that is disturbing;

		this all becomes some sort of party, i wonder how long it takes

		to fly from warsaw to tel aviv but alexandra is actually flying to

		new york - there is now a group of people mainly girls - one of them

		remninds me of helena's jeans under a tied christian dior shirt

		she pulled on like you would a t-shirt...buttons must feel she does

		not like them enough to unbutton and so forth...well in the dream 

		it is not her, someone more spanish although possibly not spain -

		lotta hinted that she had a greatly good time in mallorca yet i 

		have not witnessed the recording myself...in the dream i feel

		drained while the woman in those specific jeans looks to be in 

		an orgasmic convulsion as if possessed like a spirit is making 

		love her or at least nibble kissing her neck yet no one is near

		and worse everyone acts as if nothing is going down...i must have 

		got up at some point and am standing in the crowd studying her -

		she has another fit in the epilepsy style except this time she

		is intent on reaching the source of her frantic excitement - 

		as she exits i see two men on a bed, there is a tv on and a

		laptop also on next it...i say something about turning at least

		one of them off and they don't disagree...i awake right after

		to find that i only slept a couple of hours...i jot the basics

		of the scenes, fill the bath with water and ivory and hope

		i can catch some more minutes of sleep and or dreams that make

		more sense before i slip into coffee and internet and such...

		thursday is rising fast and my only plan is to go through my

		scales especially the two new ones i keep mixing up - not certain

		why arabic translates in thought as if enigmatic and vice versa...

		(my ritual is now at eighteen scales, one of them

		my own hybrid creation...)

		ps. did more sleep did sleep more yet maybe too much...seen mallorca

		except she seemed more content in the paradoxe...i recalled another

		scene wherein some child dislodged a lens from my frames...i pick

		it up to see if it can be returned to place but it is shattered

		and much larger...dolce gabanna it actually happened in the city

		without a kid just a sliver missing, glasses i still wear...well,

		outside as for some reason i took to not wearing eyewear at home -

		meanwhile london and i never understood how sarcastic daniel's

		face could be but i mean that in a goodly way...expression, some

		faces need no words to communicate...lotta communicates eye patches

		in stories yet her puffy morning eyes are when i think she looks

		exquisitely beautiful...but now i know prada preceeded the perfume

		in dusseldorf...alison james wrote wilhemina tempest's obituary -

		 “We are such stuff as dreams are made on, and our little life is 
		
		rounded with a sleep.”

		i have inclinations to continue to employ the pen at ASDBL and

		even the alaska experiment yet it is not pressing, it is like

		ideas or notions i wonder if i should augment with...obviously

		wilhemina bring this to mind as i'm not sure if i made it clear

		enough that she branches out from the source muse character to

		another yes that and the fact that i think it might be good

		to list all the types of horses perhaps in a glossary as

		burroughs did with drugs...there is actually a buzz as if

		i am getting high on my own writing...

		 “You taught me language, and my profit on’t is,
		
		I know how to curse.”

		25 october -

		friday the funeral I did not attend or intend to go to...

		in speaking to the widow about my reasons, the point arose

		in mind's irony...well i had a dream that i was standing

		in a funeral ceremony viewing myself in the coffin...

		i said it was about the age of twelve but most likely it

		was later as it impressed me so that it was among the 

		first attempts at literature...the dream is true however

		the fear of it is not...i stayed up much later than 

		i wanted, getting up several times to make soup and 

		and to make coffee and even again to seduce the hunger

		into submission with a slice of bread...there was an 

		emptiness i could not explain...let us call it an invasion -

		a mystical raid that later even extended into language as a

		foreign song tried to spin around my head...

		it was late morning by the time i got to sleep, the hours

		herein reflect a european time zone - 

		early evening awoke from dreams that found me in a 

		modern building - the office type - i am trying to

		get a pair of shoes fixed and i am told by a woman

		where i could get that done...as i approach the elevator

		it shuts and slides down yet i hear someone say they

		will bring it back which nearly instantly they do as

		i then find myself holding a pair of adidas...it is

		an elevator operator like in a recent instyle story

		reel which lucy was in...i suppose it came to mind

		and there i am with her but it is like a pastry shop

		where i lose sight of her and start unwrapping and

		tasting and returning the sweets to their place wrapped, 
		
		as the voice of some other women recommends, i like the taste

		or perhaps i have not satisfied the weird hunger...

		i think to get some for the widow and the dream ends.

		i had viewed a japanese film, kubi, which is said to be

		about events in 1582...although crowded with bloody

		scenes and even a careless view of homosexuality or 

		if you prefer a degrading view of women
		
		(which should prove shocking enough to most),it still did not

		have that centerpiece alike hellboy the crooked man

		wherein the snake exits the girl's down there parts

		and slithers up into her mouth...the most striking 

		moment was the "delicious" poisoned snapper irony. 

		if only they could have bought dean martin's ain't

		that a kick in the head for the final credits.

                12 november...was it lennon, life is waht happens

		when you are busy making other plans...i did not

		intend to have to wait so long for a dream that

		made sense enough to put place into words...

		although i know the experience as commonplace to

		myself when under the influence of weed wherein

		dreams are so light they carry no weight in memory...

		meanwhile i kept cleaning house...i view'd several

		many more films, most recently thunderball, man woman 

		or teen was that tom jones belting out the theme...

		sean sucking claudine's foot...she was in a genius 

		bikini...in the dream it was evening and within that

		night the rain poured down in storm-fashion...the times

		wroted 'trump storms back' as if it wasnt enough to 

		have stuck their neck out on the silly endorsement they

		seemed to go with a cheap daniels jape...

		i remember i went shopping for a fan - thinking it sort

		of proved that 2020 was replete, filled with fraud...

		people, in the dream scene were running, crowds of them, 

		through the shadow of trees above where i walked which

		was a roadway, a woman was with me as we decided to hail 

		a taxi, japanese contraption spied letting out a customer

		and i got in as the girl vanished - a very little man 

		drove but on the side as one might find in those sidekick

		motorcycle - another man without pickles kept nearing 

		from the front i faced as if searching me for something -

		i searched through sofia's first well second failed film

		which is called priscilla, first girl i ever kissed in 

		some childhood lobby uptown, it starts ramones perfect

		directer by spector but i felt the cast did not resemble

		the reality, even graceland looked like an apartment not

		a mansion, vegas scene was nice, the hinted los angeles

		ending was cool yet like the book burning it didnt capture

		the impact...no elvis songs in the soundtrack sure was

		shocking...yes i know easy to monday morning quarterback
		
		pick apart and yes obviously a great amount of effort

		went into it...hopefully she will get back to form in 

		her next scenes...the driver did not want to go to 

		bella vista and i had to agree to be let out as near

		to my destination as he could manage...i awoke before

		getting anywhere, gabby got published with nowhere, usa

		and i was very happy for her without agreeing that the

		midwest is hell...or even frozen although i know poetic 

		language is what language cannot be...robert graves,

		the white goddess, a reading that makes me feel the 

		limit of my own recall. thousands of stories and 

		connections which are impossible to memorize...

		embraced it awake and held it asleep...one understands

		some of the major points, the intent, let us call it

		the premise...in itself a duality that aims to prove and

		provoke yet in the build up of facts and circumstantial

		evidence there is a dizzy sort of who or what question

		as the whirlwind spins into a series of explorations...

		i agree somewhat - not with the style - but with the 

		concept and feel especially thrilled that there is 

		no pop quiz at the end of this bizarre masterpiece. 

		the jews agree; the body should be buried...the outrun,

		say or see never looked so beautiful yet how could such

		an intelligent character be so dumb? well, drinking 

		does kill brain cells, they say...did love the ending. 

		these are not movie recommendations, merely notes for

		i know not what exactly except by definition as a writer 

		i scribble into the constant illusion of now...

		the past presents itself in emilee form again the run,

		in the book he mentions witches running around a place 

		nine times to cast a spell or the mirror walk behind

		the cursed one so their prat fall results in the stumble -

		there's a little girl, so precious and pretty, i am sure

		it is an illusion but i explain that yes i am keeping

		my promise to the extent that no masked intruder could

		make a fool of me...for a minute i wanted to believe 

		michael was innocent but then i asked myself and even

		ai what other man ever asked to sleep with someone's

		child nevermind the box of porn under the bed...

		ah yes, ready or not - a real modern classic with

		spontanous combustion...dear me i liked that one alot,

		in some ways a sort of documentary i felt for myself

		as i sometimes believe my family has always been out

		to rub out or switch off my dream girl...maternal

		grandmother being the exception, i digress...not meaning

		to have such a word count here dear readers if i have

		any other dream to report you will find it here...

		please note - warner brothers/level is pulling the

		plug on two skinny girls...i could remove the 

		catalog now but why would i? so i am letting it happen

		so it will be on their heads not mine and re-uploading

		the songs after that point. hopefully there won't

		be much downtime but so you know it is not a glitch

		in the streaming services or outlets circa 18 november

		and beyond.
