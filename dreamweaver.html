		<p class="feature-intro">i get up to usual smoke nicotine, java
cup caffeine. <font color="lime"> dream said girl trying
to show me her body. like a dressing
room. i try to explain the blur...
how in my imagination it is the face.
partly by choice yet also by the
mailer fact of being aware of 
one's self after writing 
anything even remotely
worth the while...
how easy it is to become
a puppet for spies...
dylan said he saw his loved
ones turning into puppets...
i tune into past slow train
finding an infidels out take
and record it twice -
neither good yet great in
not having practiced or evev
heard it since years a go go...</p>
				<p>visions watching that film -
one of the houses reminds
me so keenly of a recent
photoshoot i felt uneasy over -
there is a hidden camera 
in the wall...
most likely hidden cameras
in every wall, two skinny
girls ricochet aint no walls,
laws like gender...
bender aunt dream i step
into hallway saying mother...
mother do you think they'll like 
this song oooh ah...
i can't find her and put on
a beret, sit on sofa with 
emilee as she teases me about
my messy hair...i cook in the
messy kitchen, i eat with pepsi
and memory of her...</p>
		<p class="feature-intro"> clean up, concerned over how
expensive basic materials can be
or become...i taxi to shop,
turtle neck girl i look
i look and she looks and we
dance at looking and looking
away until the cantonese 
woman slides up next to me
examining q-tips, she is wearing
a tee that reads most valuable
player, very friendly, at least
for a chinese woman...
i say a few words in my choppy
chinese and wave goodbye -
i think about them both
as i arrive to put away the
haul but more in terms of why
emilee wore a turtle neck
in california and the series
of t-shirts in recent post...</p>

		<p class="feature-intro"> long ago gave up on hoping
to make a friend in this town.
skirt eats fancy trout -
it is raining as the power
line explodes and the lights 
go out - i sigh, but it doesnt
take too long. i guess i;m
gearing up for new songs and
giving my readers a break
from from all the granting
although it is yet foremost
in my mind's worried eye...
i select a title and 
commit changes. <br></font color="lime">

thinking about you
know who...
it takes me four
hours to eat
all the desire...
i view sin takes
a holiday, there
is talk of putin
possibly accepting
a cease fire...
they call him
ironically a war
lord...i dont 
understand the
word unironically.

"FullsizeMugshotHandle"	
super size obituaries 
i log into x formerly 
twitter...
flirt with the idea
of a caleb carr post,
son of lucien said
the beatniks were
not child friendly
and they weren't 
i read alienest and
thought it was all right.
like an overnight stay
in jail.

i months late
laundry...
someone force me to
write emails and
do laundry...
i dont nkow
waht she meant,
but it is none of
my business...
i simply wait for
her even when she
is right in the middle
of my thoughts...
miss grant goes to the door,

eight minutes 1940s...
i close-up her hand
on screen place mine
atop and somehow do not
feel weird over it...
these wires love infused
with chaotic emotions i cut,
hang wet sheets randomly
the cat has trout and
then chicken but is ready
for more...
like me with cigarettes...
coffee... </font color="lime">

		<p class="feature-intro start">>>> saturday </p>

		<p class="feature-intro">staying up till nearly eleven
at night <font color="lime">i hadn't coded a page
in a while...still ongoing with what background
img to match the font...
awake about four, horny and exhausted.
all sorts of hurry and anxious throbbing 
worry wearing me as if i were their clothes
cupcake cloths the coffee...of course i'm 
thinking of her, once upon a time she said
something about anxiety and depression...
i try to go to sleep again at six,
but it is reconversion blues - 
scattered thoughts - a revolving door mind
so i get up again, i want to be nice
to charlotte and sofia yet i don't
want emilee to think i am being too nice -
i repeat the attempt to sleep some more
at eight but it's tuesday's just as bad
so i stormy monday into civil war -
no the windmills, add bread and onion
to left over steak which is smomehow
smokehouse delicious...i see the
stack of bodies but i don't feel
as i did with the wet version which
made me feel cheated, besides it's
dunst - this is kdk12 calling kdk1...
i was thrilled to see her and
and the film was pretty thought
provoking...it's one that i 
suspect a lot of people will watch
twice...in a power of the dog trance
i waltz around the early afternoon,
i've got rawhide phil, fill a thought
with that dog obit kabuso,
also a fruit i read; Citrus sphaerocarpa
sit us fears of coppers...
turquoise skies bright with light
porn dark with disasters yet 
in pouring myself away from the
sun and the sex i notice the name
candice demellza...
but i'm supposed to be writing
poetry not clearing 
the minefield of vulgarity
an impossible task in any case-
three thirty, why was i 
playing the suspended scale
in the fourth position alike
the blues version, should we
show them the blues? don't
let that out, these things take 
time. rhyme - devil's interval-
rubbing out the word, still
the word dust gathers...
emilee needs a butch vampire
in her life, but you could
also pick up something from
her esty shop 
Persimmon Hollow...
no wait, she is not estying now,
so ask @fairygoodfriends
