   <h1>dreamweaver two</h1>
        <p><b>
         23 october 2024 oh to redeploy this on a smurf anniversary. i think i should have waited until the 30th,
		
		ezra pound day, or even november...yet there is a lot on my mind and writing is what i do...
		
		pelevin does not write in fact he puzzles over a position, sometimes in brilliant fashion,
		
		until drowning it with a sort of too much information for his readers to process...in my
		
		experience the nearest example for contrast would be phillip k dick...

		the writer had recently completed notes for a novel and was told pdk shopped
		
		at happy dog for horse meat when he was struggling to survive hence horselover fat...

		that is to say it is the type of style one encounters in valis except amped up as if
		
		the loudness allowed more freedom of speech i suppose...

		subsequently i read the horse stealers by anton chekhov...

		let's see before i delve deeper...i have decided to not include the preceeding notes,
		
		themselves possibly a book or two, these should stand on their own and if any reader
		
		would like them well i would not refuse a request to package them up and send them 
		through...

		my point is that writing freely should not be mistaken with writing for free, life
		
		is not free and even awful writing is paid...case in point, colleen hoover...

		or do women usually follow men into new york city restrooms after the author
		
		picks at bulgokov's entrance...

		ahem. i never realized how good lecarre was until reading his first novel which
		
		was perfection save for the jewess's confession and the ending list in any case
		
		miles above the film version which kept the wife as self-described nymphomaniac
		
		slut in a redundant twist that must've made john's head spin...

		yes i know too much prelude for dream notes and so here goes; 

		hurricane milton followed helene and i was haunted by the control weather brim skit 
		
		as many others thought the democrats were trying to smash the hard core red state
		
		voters to gain those delegates, those delicate votes...

		one ukrainian and his family got swallowed in florida after escaping the so-called
		
		war...the appointment in samara fleshed out with full irony...

		within my own contradictions i dreamt of a topless cousin and eating cake -
		
		later seeing her arrive with other girls...hadnt thought of her much since
		
		she never invited me to her wedding and later that evening i had a clear vision
		
		of her bed...excuse me i am not looking for parking, in fact i don't have a vehicle...

		the man mom married passed away on the same day as jack kerouac had, which was about the
		
		time she moved to the states over the hills and far away...

		something kept trying to connect me with him and i even felt it scan memory as if
		
		to say aha or even make it my demise...i was starting to even feel dizzy sick until
		
		james cagney directed shortcut to hell...

		i'm with zelda in france at some art class and it feels as natural as being
		
		with joan in england pub except one of them was taking my picture and i had not
		
		shaved and tried to hide my stubble as it were...

		floating in my apartment as if visiting myself - the cat is on one of the beds -

		finding myself in a car being kissed by ava and her triangle tongue, later
		speaking with zofia...

		a man was handing me a great variety of two dollar bills, i watched flightplan
		
		again and catchfire, how does one forget nudity - perhaps when the talent
		
		is so overwhelming that what remains is the method not the madness -

		loro was a real revelation and i had no answer to my own question, if you liked
		
		youth so much why not seek out other films by that director...

		the family friend was no let down, even thrilling once in a while -

		meanwhile the box of things minus the requested samsonite case i asked for
		
		which was sent out in june finally arrived in october...

		i was much more satisfied by the substance, i keep looking back at it amazed
		
		at its form...

		reminded after of the girl i walk'd some with - down riverside drive...

		dress as if meant to be recalled...packing suitcase as marlon talks -

		i think he was recording to tape also...talk of order, standing in line

		french fries conspiracy - a finger at my lip - what does the sticker say?

		two million dollars carrying a girl inside a movie theatre - someone is tracking

		us - i think of laura sophia instead of lotta, fresh air - i'm standing at the 

		entrance of a mansion, in fact i think i only dreamt of lotta once...in any

		case i recite the phone number that pre-dates me and is yet active -

		there are two women one undressed and bleeding it seems like menstruation

		unfiltered and left without washing but it is all so fast i cannot focus

		and awake like when walking on aluminum foil landscape - was it bird or insect

		at window suddenly mixed by chirp or crawling sound within me...not sure

		yet i was trying to escape...i cannot escape my lost apartment, there i 

		am with mother painting the hall i am going to my room convinced that my

		date is not coming, but the girl arrives wearing a pleated skirt which she

		raises in front of me as if to make me get up...there is an indian statue 

		with the word nadie or nadia and i like it deciding to put place it on

		my dresser...it wears a dark shawl, i start thinking they also did not 

		send my japanese cat statue...so when did i actually start to weep? well,

		during dominique when the boy dies protecting the girl oksana left in 

		a chained padlock light switch room...not that i'm the action packed type

		but someone called asking for leidsa numbers i think i said 34, 76,

		and 91...nobody called in terms of condolences. 
		
		(one call from an aunt followed this typing,

		which inspired me to invent a man who had

		a toaster for an ass which needed to be plugged in)
		
		alina sent nude pictures. (possible email scam

		but as a gentleman i try to reply pleasantly)

		i only cry in the movies and even if i spend the day smoking i never light
		
		up a cigarette in dreams...
		<br>
		<br>

		0ctober 24...dreams like visitations - well, visions to be precise...
		
		i had received a phone call, a nearly unusual event these days...

		so there was more talk than what has become ordinary - i suppose that

		along with texting went a ways into overwhelming my senses - 

		i went to sleep at the second hour after midnight thinking of

		book titles and elvis costello - one of us is lying...i get what

		feels like a locked car in the sun temperature or perhaps a sun

		soaked roof feeling and get up to let in fresh air and pour

		water on myself...when i finally get to sleep i dream that i am

		naked on my bed and someone starts speaking...i cover myself and

		feel cool enough not to wonder or worry since it is a know face -

		still, there is something about it upon reflection that is disturbing;

		this all becomes some sort of party, i wonder how long it takes

		to fly from warsaw to tel aviv but alexandra is actually flying to

		new york - there is now a group of people mainly girls - one of them

		remninds me of helena's jeans under a tied christian dior shirt

		she pulled on like you would a t-shirt...buttons must feel she does

		not like them enough to unbutton and so forth...well in the dream 

		it is not her, someone more spanish although possibly not spain -

		lotta hinted that she had a greatly good time in mallorca yet i 

		have not witnessed the recording myself...in the dream i feel

		drained while the woman in those specific jeans looks to be in 

		an orgasmic convulsion as if possessed like a spirit is making 

		love her or at least nibble kissing her neck yet no one is near

		and worse everyone acts as if nothing is going down...i must have 

		got up at some point and am standing in the crowd studying her -

		she has another fit in the epilepsy style except this time she

		is intent on reaching the source of her frantic excitement - 

		as she exits i see two men on a bed, there is a tv on and a

		laptop also on next it...i say something about turning at least

		one of them off and they don't disagree...i awake right after

		to find that i only slept a couple of hours...i jot the basics

		of the scenes, fill the bath with water and ivory and hope

		i can catch some more minutes of sleep and or dreams that make

		more sense before i slip into coffee and internet and such...

		thursday is rising fast and my only plan is to go through my

		scales especially the two new ones i keep mixing up - not certain

		why arabic translates in thought as if enigmatic and vice versa...

		(my ritual is now at eighteen scales, one of them

		my own hybrid creation...)

		ps. did more sleep did sleep more yet maybe too much...seen mallorca

		except she seemed more content in the paradoxe...i recalled another

		scene wherein some child dislodged a lens from my frames...i pick

		it up to see if it can be returned to place but it is shattered

		and much larger...dolce gabanna it actually happened in the city

		without a kid just a sliver missing, glasses i still wear...well,

		outside as for some reason i took to not wearing eyewear at home -

		meanwhile london and i never understood how sarcastic daniel's

		face could be but i mean that in a goodly way...expression, some

		faces need no words to communicate...lotta communicates eye patches

		in stories yet her puffy morning eyes are when i think she looks

		exquisitely beautiful...but now i know prada preceeded the perfume

		in dusseldorf...alison james wrote wilhemina tempest's obituary -

		 “We are such stuff as dreams are made on, and our little life is 
		
		rounded with a sleep.”

		i have inclinations to continue to employ the pen at ASDBL and

		even the alaska experiment yet it is not pressing, it is like

		ideas or notions i wonder if i should augment with...obviously

		wilhemina bring this to mind as i'm not sure if i made it clear

		enough that she branches out from the source muse character to

		another yes that and the fact that i think it might be good

		to list all the types of horses perhaps in a glossary as

		burroughs did with drugs...there is actually a buzz as if

		i am getting high on my own writing...

		 “You taught me language, and my profit on’t is,
		
		I know how to curse.”

		<br>
		<br>

		25 october -

		friday the funeral I did not attend or intend to go to...

		in speaking to the widow about my reasons, the point arose

		in mind's irony...well i had a dream that i was standing

		in a funeral ceremony viewing myself in the coffin...

		i said it was about the age of twelve but most likely it

		was later as it impressed me so that it was among the 

		first attempts at literature...the dream is true however

		the fear of it is not...i stayed up much later than 

		i wanted, getting up several times to make soup and 

		and to make coffee and even again to seduce the hunger

		into submission with a slice of bread...there was an 

		emptiness i could not explain...let us call it an invasion -

		a mystical raid that later even extended into language as a

		foreign song tried to spin around my head...

		it was late morning by the time i got to sleep, the hours

		herein reflect a european time zone - 

		early evening awoke from dreams that found me in a 

		modern building - the office type - i am trying to

		get a pair of shoes fixed and i am told by a woman

		where i could get that done...as i approach the elevator

		it shuts and slides down yet i hear someone say they

		will bring it back which nearly instantly they do as

		i then find myself holding a pair of adidas...it is

		an elevator operator like in a recent instyle story

		reel which lucy was in...i suppose it came to mind

		and there i am with her but it is like a pastry shop

		where i lose sight of her and start unwrapping and

		tasting and returning the sweets to their place wrapped, 
		
		as the voice of some other women recommends, i like the taste

		or perhaps i have not satisfied the weird hunger...

		i think to get some for the widow and the dream ends.

		i had viewed a japanese film, kubi, which is said to be

		about events in 1582...although crowded with bloody

		scenes and even a careless view of homosexuality or 

		if you prefer a degrading view of women
		
		(which should prove shocking enough to most),it still did not

		have that centerpiece alike hellboy the crooked man

		wherein the snake exits the girl's down there parts

		and slithers up into her mouth...the most striking 

		moment was the "delicious" poisoned snapper irony. 

		if only they could have bought dean martin's ain't

		that a kick in the head for the final credits.

                12 november...was it lennon, life is waht happens

		when you are busy making other plans...i did not

		intend to have to wait so long for a dream that

		made sense enough to put place into words...

		although i know the experience as commonplace to

		myself when under the influence of weed wherein

		dreams are so light they carry no weight in memory...

		meanwhile i kept cleaning house...i view'd several

		many more films, most recently thunderball, man woman 

		or teen was that tom jones belting out the theme...

		sean sucking claudine's foot...she was in a genius 

		bikini...in the dream it was evening and within that

		night the rain poured down in storm-fashion...the times

		wroted 'trump storms back' as if it wasnt enough to 

		have stuck their neck out on the silly endorsement they

		seemed to go with a cheap daniels jape...

		i remember i went shopping for a fan - thinking it sort

		of proved that 2020 was replete, filled with fraud...

		people, in the dream scene were running, crowds of them, 

		through the shadow of trees above where i walked which

		was a roadway, a woman was with me as we decided to hail 

		a taxi, japanese contraption spied letting out a customer

		and i got in as the girl vanished - a very little man 

		drove but on the side as one might find in those sidekick

		motorcycle - another man without pickles kept nearing 

		from the front i faced as if searching me for something -

		i searched through sofia's first well second failed film

		which is called priscilla, first girl i ever kissed in 

		some childhood lobby uptown, it starts ramones perfect

		directer by spector but i felt the cast did not resemble

		the reality, even graceland looked like an apartment not

		a mansion, vegas scene was nice, the hinted los angeles

		ending was cool yet like the book burning it didnt capture

		the impact...no elvis songs in the soundtrack sure was

		shocking...yes i know easy to monday morning quarterback
		
		pick apart and yes obviously a great amount of effort

		went into it...hopefully she will get back to form in 

		her next scenes...the driver did not want to go to 

		bella vista and i had to agree to be let out as near

		to my destination as he could manage...i awoke before

		getting anywhere, gabby got published with nowhere, usa

		and i was very happy for her without agreeing that the

		midwest is hell...or even frozen although i know poetic 

		language is what language cannot be...robert graves,

		the white goddess, a reading that makes me feel the 

		limit of my own recall. thousands of stories and 

		connections which are impossible to memorize...

		embraced it awake and held it asleep...one understands

		some of the major points, the intent, let us call it

		the premise...in itself a duality that aims to prove and

		provoke yet in the build up of facts and circumstantial

		evidence there is a dizzy sort of who or what question

		as the whirlwind spins into a series of explorations...

		i agree somewhat - not with the style - but with the 

		concept and feel especially thrilled that there is 

		no pop quiz at the end of this bizarre masterpiece. 

		the jews agree; the body should be buried...the outrun,

		say or see never looked so beautiful yet how could such

		an intelligent character be so dumb? well, drinking 

		does kill brain cells, they say...did love the ending. 

		these are not movie recommendations, merely notes for

		i know not what exactly except by definition as a writer 

		i scribble into the constant illusion of now...

		the past presents itself in emilee form again the run,

		in the book he mentions witches running around a place 

		nine times to cast a spell or the mirror walk behind

		the cursed one so their prat fall results in the stumble -

		there's a little girl, so precious and pretty, i am sure

		it is an illusion but i explain that yes i am keeping

		my promise to the extent that no masked intruder could

		make a fool of me...for a minute i wanted to believe 

		michael was innocent but then i asked myself and even

		ai what other man ever asked to sleep with someone's

		child nevermind the box of porn under the bed...

		ah yes, ready or not - a real modern classic with

		spontanous combustion...dear me i liked that one alot,

		in some ways a sort of documentary i felt for myself

		as i sometimes believe my family has always been out

		to rub out or switch off my dream girl...maternal

		grandmother being the exception, i digress...not meaning

		to have such a word count here dear readers if i have

		any other dream to report you will find it here...

		please note - warner brothers/level is pulling the

		plug on two skinny girls...i could remove the 

		catalog now but why would i? so i am letting it happen

		so it will be on their heads not mine and re-uploading

		the songs after that point. hopefully there won't

		be much downtime but so you know it is not a glitch

		in the streaming services or outlets circa 18 november

		and beyond. 

		<br>
		<br>
		
                13 november dream fading upon waking possibly eva green
		
		or lotta stichler, the knit sweater taking longer than
		
		i expected, the idea of twin sister sure is interesting-
		
		not so interesting is the day's unusual diet dessert
		
		flan on top of leftover chinese and two almond cupcakes -
		
		it's like being drowsy drunk on food...fueled with never

		say never again where sean returns to bookend the remake

		i make thoughts on megapolis, as i revist the ending 

		of the white goddess wherein graves gives the devil his due

		as it were...my bath so cold i yelped -

		where was i oh yes this one is not easy, i hope it is

		like depalma scarface which i couldnt understand until a second viewing,

		but i boubt it as this seems to require the faith of an inner child

		yet it is precisely achild in the role of an assassin...

		elvis impersonator felt weird unless one thinks of his daughter -

		my fued with it can be in the sum of two points;

		that lead actress seemed to be pulled from the cast of show girls

		and dud did not transmit emotions required for empathy and

		morpheus stands around as if he had really been killed

		in the apocalypse now boat a walking zombie also doing voice 

		over keeping in mind that he can memorize shakespeare

		it must have been the easiest role he ever learnt

		but if vourse iyt is not a movie...it is a family affair

		 a warning and a prayer with deliverance arrows

		my firs thought was oh no not a happy ending

		sensed tears at the dedication to wife

		once he was going to forget everythint he had learned

		and write like he was a teen, perhaps that is what 

		we have seen...director's cut? classified

		wondering why aaron kept leaving the fire arms released

		along with the extended version of caligula well

		woman of the hour had something, that is how wrong 

		we can be in judging...anyway i was hoping for a 

		sort of youth without youth vibe but maybe next time -

		at least there was a real sense of new york city in

		the apprentice...pre-disney manhattan might have been

		the message in me gap ol is...ford to city drop...

		of course the issue with outstanding acting ie

		the critic is that one starts rooting for the villainous 

		character...irony will drown us all...

		i tear up the picture of the fat man of the week

		tv show interview the dearly departed had done 

		finding it alone in a scrap book never started -

		i play my scales over the film concentrating on

		the gypsy...now thinking that's what dylan called

		elvis staying in a big hotel smiling as he appreached

		saying well well...i try to take a nap but the nap

		takes me further into thinking with the national

		soundtrack of ymca village folk rising in nonsense

		echoing...young mens christian association...

		maybe it will help jerry lee's cousin jimmy...

		maybe i have overdosed on film...certainly

		on porn...some other position postultes 

		god in the volcano or zeus...some of it makes

		sense and it gives me pause...perhaps i have to

		revisit joseph campbell's ideas...tomorrow and

		tomorrow alexander the great is named pharaoh

		but that 332BC, not because but before it's fun

		to stay at the why have we not been there...

		<br>
		<br>

		14 november

		i'd felt outside my self all day as if waiting
		
		for the evening and the i'd felt the evening
		
		was not waiting for me...

		they say the berlin ruling system collapsed,
		
		they say dw union is on a two day strike...

		maybe i was locked in a teledisco booth -

		some of the monkeys were given fruit loops...

		in terms of entertainment, i should have mentioned

                finally catching up with the second parts of 

		ahs 12 as well as american horror stories. 

		emma, have i got a story for you concerning

		the ambulance birth...but i didn't get why

		wear the bitch's headgear?

		otherwise i liked the liminal spaces idea

		but i really have an insnae bias against

		blubbler so i could hardly enjoy the 

		last part of the stories which should have

		brought to mind asylum season, yeah i was

		more worried that the buttons of her blouse

		were going to fly off into the the other

		actress's face...

		pre dream pissing on lotta's face...

		walking through the chelsea hotel thinking

		of the brazilian girl i went there with

		willy deville singing to walk that girl home...

		minutes or moments later it's all pretty dark

		and i seem to be without a body hovering or

		hooked up with some woman on amsterdam avenue

		who is upset over the drug dealers that stand

		around in fron of the shop she's trying to 

		get into...i hear the vague outline of her

		voice arguing against them and they seem 

		to be replicas of each other even in the

		way they are dressed...i don't know where

		this dream went - i get up too early but

		take a minute or a moment for cigarettes

		coffee and this note...marian is on my 

		mind as i give skirt the party mix eats...

		there's a text message about a wallet and

		it nearly derails all the details of the

		dreaming but as i type i start to recall

		the strange door dreams, three k where

		i find cheese and nickel bags thinking 

		to snack and go back to my room and puff

		when it sounded like someone was at the

		entrance...other door dream opening but

		then it does not fit like three quarters

		of it only which left a slender opening...

		here door a motley gang of men insisting

		that i am having a soiree and wanting to

		come in and celebrate as i stand there

		baffled and nearly upset...i had lined

		the back door with litre glasses of 

		coca cola bottles, but it was the front

		door. people are strange when you're a

		stranger should have been played.

		seven in the morning sweden, one in the

		morning here, eleven in the evening los

		angeles. this ain't the mud club or cbgb's...

		early afternoon in asian towns, sounds like

		monkey genocide in thailand...valencia might

		re-flood with evacuations underway, i hope

		padam padam is a hit but there is no logical

		way to juggle time zones...

		23 november...so much has gone down and yet 

		not much has happened...arrival of guest and

		groovy haul - my habit was to always buy one

		nice shirt when possible but i find myself with

		five new shirts all at once...

		a weird luxury. some rich dreams too yet

		mostly disintegrating as the waking thoughts

		rattle me up to serve breakfast and start the

		day...a few weeks ago i was very happy that

		lucy  was going to film in rome, i think

		where fellini worked out his scenese, and 

		i sure did have a dream wherein we were very

		friendly as if rejoicing yet lotta  had

		gone to new york and mentioned a girl named

		giulia which then made me think it might have

		been her in the dream...not much time for

		sleep as i don't allow my guest to cook or

		clean...but this is no complaint or protest...

		i play the substance everyday, today will be

		the fifth time...in fact i am looking forward 

		to it...there's a week or so left of this 

		"visiting" and i will try to report on the

		proceedings as soon as possible...posed

		one of the "taken down" songs and it was 

		a spirit breaking experience...the cover was

		not accepted since they require very specific

		dimensions, so my lock and key artwork went

		by the wayside for some stock image...then

		the exported catalog is all in wav files but

		this requires mp3 or flac...it was for -low fi-

		and they require at least one foreign language

		metadata and i chose traditional chinese which

		then had to be augmented by simplified chinese...

		i could not imagine doing this for thirty songs...

		would you? the lyrics of it's a long way to the top

		if you want to rock and roll never mentioned such

		tedious work involved in getting one's music out...

		for reference; (low fi)<br>

----- chords

-------<br>

well, stuck inside of mobile with the memphis blues again did

	sort of say there was some sort of repetition involved

		in the "creative" process; smoking eyelids

		and punched cigarettes...

ashes when i have tray time i will see if there is another

way to get the other songs out in the format they already have...

i listened to it again thinking sure it's not a hit but it is not

run of the mill...usually it's books that go out of print...

to have this happen to songs is beyond bizarre...

sort of like gogol's the nose! 

well, here's wishing you all a decent thanksgiving. <br>

		27 november...i dreamt yesterday that iwas

		flying to to europe from the states...germany

		i suppose as that is a recurring scene in my

		dream mind...in this case the airport and 

		luggage were all very detailed - someone was 

		speaking as if asking questions, not sure what

		i said...did recall a pre-dream nightmare

		wherein i am talking to my sister as if

		hypnotized...she had actually dropped by -

		then again yesterday with her motley crew...

		went to sleep late smoking and wondering why

		lotta was still in new york...i dreamt playing

		guitar with the stones and trying to figure out

		some song about a feline in the key of c major...

		i got up early feeling tired all day - but it was

		rainy and i rather enjoy the downpour...she got

		miu miu eyewear and was on her way to the plane...

		i actually have not taken the time for notes or

		chords although i did make a leather strap for

		the ibanez...the idea was that not playing my

		daily scales would help her in some way...silly 

		yet it satisfied something in my thoughts...

		or more correctly in my superstition - 

		anyway i am looking ahead to getting back in 

		rhythm tomorrow...besides, in skipping the 

		thanksgiving shingdig, i will have the evening

		all to my self, well myself and skirt...

		had not heard the song flight 505, well five

		days left of hosting after tomorrow  as the 

		guest leaves early on the first week of december.

		word to the wise, don't dare miss say or see 

		singing one of the blitz songs in the studio, 

		it is exceptional or to kick at madonna's nerves

		some; it is neat. 

		<br>
		30 november...weird watery dream wherein there 

		was a screen embedded into the faucet handel

		of the shower...it resembled one of those

		ancient portable tv screens but smaller...

		invention dream; shower faucets with media 

		screens...

		hmm...then of course i did not have a free

		thanksgiving as my guest decided not to go out -

		at least the lions won...memories of detroit 

		swirled in thought...then further into childhood

		and my jacket...they have never gone all way -

		i really liked that jacket...you gotta lose

		your mind in detroit rock city...billy idol

		covered bob dylan's if not for you, i heard

		grace slick talking and was amazed by her 

		honesty - but how is time magazine ten dollars?

		back to scales, felt no lapse. guest did venture

		out to visit someone else and so i do have part 

		of taday free...in a moment of idk browsed the 

		perlude to moby dick and thought melville had

		influenced me more than i realized...lotta left

		via  gate 65 and arrived, an hour late, via gate

		66...i thought the detail was quirky...lauren 

		got a ritual candle and robyn erased her kill 

		bill halloween pictures which i now miss...

		third day of pizza but my stomach has been sensitive

		for two days...i didn't expect, at this point, any 

		dream recall at all yet last night the scenes were

		pretty particular - as if i had married virginia 

		and one of her children was even calling me daddy...

		then moving into an apartment which was more like 

		a mailbox building or perhaps the locker in the 

		substance where the packages are delivered...

		everything seemed so compact...i always feel this

		place itself is too big for one person but i like

		the options of several rooms...in the one room 

		dream i sensed sister invading thought as she had

		said she was going to an apartment hotel for the

		weekend and when this happens i always wonder which

		one of her known relations has slipped into my place

		as if i were him or the like? well they are scheduled

		to leave on tuesday as well as my guest...
		
                great fun with the story of the fruit vendor who

		sold a banana which was used to make art and then

		eaten by a millionaire...that antique song that

		said bananas have to ripen in a special comes to 

		mind...cheers.
		<br>
		december one
		<br>
		sunday - i first heard it within everyone says i love

		you...marshall brickman gone at eighty five...nap

		snapped into song, 'i got a notion to love you 

		all day' heard it as if had already been wroted...

		dream in the park i talk too much and can't think of

		what to say then say, i contain multitudes, which is

		a song that was alredy wroted yet i only have a vague

		memory of it since i concentrated on murder most foul

		and later on key west philosopher pirate...

		this was not intended to segue from herman, but such

		is life...late at night a flood of emotions resolving

		in hunger that made me get up again for bread and

		ironically coffee...awoke minutes before nine - dream

		lotta's mother seemingly setting up lunch or some 

		meal in a very exact way...i'm not sure, but it was

		pretty impressive and for a minute i wondered trying

		to figure out the scene aside from inner intuition 

		what it was about...like a self interview, is she

		telling me something, i usually don't eat much but

		there is no need to set up a table meal, i should

		get up and look after my guest, it seems dark but

		the foil on the windows doesnt let the sun in, if

		it is lotta's mother then why do i feel attracted,

		oh no i am excited, now how am i going to explain this...

		the misfits is on prime. i'm in the middle of grand hotel,

		i've been in the middle of it ever since the guest arrived...

		the list of films was updated but my viewing list is now

		way overdue...nothing can be done about til tuesday...

		<br>
		monday two december <br>

		after waking up way too early, i returned to sleep, 

		and woke up a bit late...i'd been thinking about

		presidential pardons and sir elton john's eyes...

		my guest continually invites me to new york...

		i suppose it makes me dream of the city. well,

		the parts that i know...you cannot actually know

		a town like that...every few streets might be 

		like entering a different country...even the

		seemingly empty spaces like tenth avenue on the

		west side or york avenue on the east are entirely

		different types of desolation...one feels industrial

		and the latter feels richly secluded even like a 

		suburb - at least that is my feeling. i suppose

		it was more in the middle, in the mid town area

		perhaps right below columbus circle...i sense the

		crowd and the countless lights, some woman asks me

		if i am drug dealer...i think only dh marks fits

		into that category...how many names bring back 2016...

		too many. i say no, quickly thinking of the ad,

		say no to dr-ugs and hoping that at least some of

		my stories and songs are addictive. meanwhile the

		cinema list has surpassed two thousand five hundred

		titles with additions from the silvia pinal filmography.

		mexican film has not had a good day in years, my favorite

		is el esqueleto de la senora morales...
		<br>
		december 4. pre departure dream sitting knees up on the
		
		the floor beside the conclusion of some sort of trap-door

		slide where a girl gently crashes into me, i could see she

		had arrived with someone else yet he vanished and we lay

		there with sort of embraced legs, it felt like until i 

		went seemingly backwards into the trap-door and down

		with a falling naked feeling which was suddenly dressed

		and dressed again by what i can only describe as mail

		bag pouches with a much softer material...say they were

		heavy cotton yet these were soft linen with the same 

		sand coloring although neither beige nor tan...

		subsequently my guest left. given that it was mom,

		well, it sure seemed to be her once in a while, i

		felt utterly alone. weird how one can get used to 

		living by one's self yet seeing and serving another

		underlines the desolation, redefines it...ruins the

		illusion of what it means to be content...the girl in

		the scene i thought was kia, in other scenes there

		are other people in the house and mom is cleaning to

		which i react in opposition against the mop...stomping

		on one fellow as if a wrestling match...last night

		dreaming of walking down a road the type that is 

		sleek asphalt yet surrounded by forest...strangers

		gathered, surrounded...for some reason i argued that

		i could not be detained because i needed to get back

		to help mother. i felt danger in the outnumbered

		position like a dying man circled by vultures...

		i cleaned my room which had been neglected for 

		cleaning the rest of the apartment, i learned the

		word semiotics which i don't like and will possibly

		never use in conversation...i learned the chords

		of a song for you and heard the story of how sir

		elton john saved leon russell from the ditch on 

		the road of life...yet it seems he was supposed

		to be a sort of underground giant, i mean even 

		as much music as i hear, i only met his songs

		because i searched out will the circle be unbroken

		once upon a time a few months ago...strange. 

		i suppose bertrand and later kurt possessed the

		name so fully that no one else has a shot with it...

		in a dream i am working and a girl is trying to 

		get me to continue working without pay and in return

		she will flash me her tits fifty thousand times giving

		me an example preview...pink red nipples i could

		hardly remember her face thereafter as she turned

		away leaving me with the image of her chest...a man

		starts speaking perhaps asking if it is a deal but

		i think i only start making excuses...later shopping

		but also sweeping dirt from the floor...something

		is missing from the items i ordered at the last place

		and another woman is shwoing me the options...eight

		o'clock closing in on nine now...my to do list involves
		
		eating, taking out the trash, and laundry...hopefully 
		
		everyone else is gearing up for christmas the only

		x-rated holiday that isn't sexual. 

		<br> december 5. the reason for a song for you was

		to play it everyday, but in the irony of life it 

		got entwined with my thoughts of mother...

		therefore, i opted for deep elem blues which also

		gives me a lot more options in terms of improvisation

		with lead riffs...i think i have the chords and some

		fills now i need to learn the words...will record it

		when it comes along...took a nap after meal and doing

		what i wanted or needed from my to do things, but then

		i was up late mostly thinking of lotta as if possessed

		by something that was never exact, never explained...

		time swimming like an olympic swimmer into dawn before

		i knew it. nothing in dream thought and it seemed some

		one due to proximity had invaded the scene wherein i am

		standing there listening to a story about how some people

		were living in a stranger's apartment and some other people

		questiong what they would do when the stranger arrived...

		in other words nothing that felt relevant to me...

		yet i note it as i don't make up dreams, maybe it will make

		sense down the line. alliteration in the news, deny defend

		depose, with at least one outlet also employing the word

		divulge...from the fourteenth century etymology ;

		"Middle English, from Anglo-French deposer,
		
		from Late Latin deponere (perfect indicative deposui), 
		
		from Latin, to put down"

		nobody should get shot outside any hotel but i like that

		'depose' is in circulation as it were...oh sweet mamma

		your daddy's got them deposed blues...

		<br>
		december 6.  i reglimpsed the start of grand hotel, 1932...

		then picked up where i had left it two weeks ago when my

		guest arrived. i will try to note my reaction without 

		spoilers and explain the sensation...there are two aspects,

		i went into it trying to understand greta garbo and then 

		upon watching trying not to mix up barrymore with klein...

		there was also the buzz in my thoughts that brought me to 

		it which was lotta having a family dinner at the grand hotel

		stockholm wearing one of the sweetest sweaters i have ever 

		seen...well there then, this movie is very good and i could 

		nearly understand the gg hype...however no luck with klein

		vs barrymore...still, the emotion overpowers the contrasting

		or rhyming appearance and at a certain point all i was thinking 

		about was the character and maybe the pocketbook...it is one

		of those films to view a few times merely for the fact that

		- as ms hynde sings - they don't make 'em like they used to...

		someone tried to make a production of me throwing out the 

		old sony radio or maybe all my attempts to get to sleep early

		converged into an irony that kept me up late again...

		i sure did dream something, i think now of lauren's neat

		drawers - maybe she got her christmas decorations done -

		i can't say what it was since i awoke sort of hounded by

		someone at the ten oclock hour...did i look too pale?

		why on earth is it that some people cannot simply agree

		to disagree...a line from license to kill resounds in 

		thought, dylan or the management that runs his tweet

		spoke of the film "based" on him or who he used to be...

		myself i refuse to see anything that actor is in since

		a rainy day in new york...because he was so helpful in

		firing up the witchhunt against the director...anyway

		cate blanchett prolly did a better bob in i;m not here

		or was it there...i'm not there...you ain't goin' nowhere...

		seven deadly sins magnitude kaliphornkneeah, they said after

		one man in butte county said to himself hey let me shoot

		at the kindergarden kids meanwhile a falling statue killed an

		eight year old in the next door state...
		
		not a good day to be child in america...

		otherwise i feel good, maybe not in the james brown way,

		yet good enough that if someone tells me to play that funky

		music, white boy, i could or possibly would. now then for

		woody; www.nytimes.com/2024/12/02/movies/woody-allen-marshall-brickman-q-and-a.html

		december 7. pearl harbors before natalia's birthday. i thought about the

		nearly logical thread that ran all the way from that film into london

		boulevard...don't be upset if i didn't mention joan crawford, she will

		be put placed prominently on the list...i viewed the great beauty -

		the opening only confused me and felt as if the director was teasing

		the audience...or like someone reluctant to let in the crowd to see

		the plot...yet it developed nicely...partly eclectic and partly 

		ironic...especially at the end which contains a great gift in the

		form of music; the beatitudes by vladimir martynov. 

		(kronos quartet)
		
		a piece that floats in a space all its own and cannot be contained

		by descriptive words, it has to be heard then one might give it

		an emotional setting upon each individual listen which could run

		the spectrum of several feelings...

		i got up well after noon after a long night thinking about lotta

		as i learned the nine months ago story when she missed a trip

		to portugal...in my dreams i was sitting somewhere where i could

		see the stairs...staring at the stairs instead of stars go figure;

		i hear the explosion that preceeds fire and see a man race up

		as if he had just set the nearby building, which in my dream mind

		i knew to be a drug den, ablaze...i thought well some people can

		never win but coldly as if empathy and myself had lost touch...

		later, certainly even colder, i am sitting elsewhere, trying to

		avoid another man as one of his friends arrive smiling at me

		like i am salvation personified...i don't like these people 

		yet in my dream mind there is a real illumination, a wisdom

		that leaves me miles away from them even as they near then

		one of them mentions not having anyone to help him although

		the other one is still there...i take it as jab at my aloof

		state of mind and for a second i am forced to look at them

		as if there were no stars in the skies only to awake wishing

		i had not had that dream and still feeling the slime of their

		greed as i walked into the hallway to fix the start of the day.

		<br>
		december 8. i had read that the rebels took Homs and were

		entering Damascus as the dream i didn't note flashed in memory

		where i was either licking or tickling a woman and suddenly

		could not escape the squirting streaming into my face...

		i don't know much, but i do know that cate left her career

		to be with kevin and i havent seen him in anything since

		the christmas balls movie...i then read that assad fled

		syria- luxury cars on display at the telegraph...

		which made me think deny defend depose was pre-coded to

		announce the toppled regime...but i think too much when it

		comes to these things...in my mind what was truly interesting

		was hearing cole porter at stella a life since that is when

		i really felt admiration for kevin yet had not seen barrymore

		uhm so there i was in another film with him in mind well with

		him and elvis costello did let's misbahve on that soundtrack...

		but the film and paula beer is a powerhouse...not to mention

		that it is a true story...my only question with it was the 

		failure to clearly claim the fact that many of the jews were

		also german - some even more so than the "germans" - it is 

		hinted via the lead's father; noted as a war veteran but i 

		felt that irony needed to be fleshed out a bit more. anyway

		to see jews working as gestapo agents in berlin gives such

		a rollercoaster ride of emotions that is like a drug...

		so very high with this film, indeed. STELLA. EIN LEBEN.

		then the shooter outside the hilton hotel and the rebel

		leader were identified in social media and in the press

		although it will most likely not be confirmed until tomorrow -

		i can only confirm that i dreamt of being in another house

		and sighing in the knowledge that the sink could not be used

		while observing someone open the faucet and watching the

		waterworks spill out from the sides and the pour down from

		the ceiling...there was a broken toilet in the corner next

		to the centered toilet...which caught my attention, usually

		there might be a bidet but who knows...so happy to write this

		as in a typo i came up with the word onserving...the cashier

		was onserving coins on the receipt upon the counter...

		in another dream uppermarket, why am i there, i am intent on

		getting exactly three items, cigarettes and two other things

		not as important as marlboros but there is a man with a beer

		belly buying sandwiches and i can see the filled bread and 

		i can feel him stand way too near as he put places his arm

		across my shoulders and starts to sway as if in celebration

		which i cannot understand squirming with a shrug awaking...

		when the ick is onserved one must pick out distance to be 

		preserved...i get up and pick lotta to worship and extend

		the distance from that dream...yet as i do i see froseth 

		pictured with a man eerily like the one in the tuppermarket

		scene. so the two jakes, jack was right. it never goes away.

		ps, bring back spy magazine so i can submit the separated

		at birth photograph of the actor in kiev alongside

		Abu Mohammed al-Jawlani...or as mellish said, I object, your honor!
		
		This trial is a travesty. It's a travesty of a mockery of a sham
		
		of a mockery of a travesty of two mockeries of a sham...

		meanwhile i have heard the deposed leader is already in moscow,

		not idaho.
		 <br>
		9 december.  sunday i somehow sidestepped the loud talk outside and

		the man yelling super colmado over and over as i had my pizza and settled

		into blitz with high hopes since i thought the coat song was really 

		special but i can only recomment the soundtrack..cheesier than the pie,

		it pulls at the audience via emotional traps plus put placing lectures

		all along the way as if the viewer needed lessons in social studies...

		it might be the only film to feature a dwarf and still not be worth 

		watching...all mouth and no trousers might well be said of itself...

		if you look at it closely you'll notice say or see asking herself

		what the hell am i doing here...the director supposedly wrote it

		but was it a joke poking at curious george? nobody could write such

		a thing! of course, we all want a perfect society and equality yet

		celluloid like this is more dangerous than helpful...if only the

		producers would now have to take the mta to get around balancing

		the cost of this corny turkey...they hit all the notes but it still

		lacks truth and sounds hollow unlike the lead's fine voice. 

		enoch powell is possibly turning over in his grave...

		i put this all out of mind asap and even managed to get to sleep

		early yet awoke too soon...i dreamt i was drinking although i don't,

		there was some argument and i was wearing a scuba diving suit inside

		a brick walled room that looked like a bunker or basement...i could

		hear someone screaming like i had during the day and stepped out of

		slumber wondering how to get back to sleep but wrote this instead...

		hmm to think i=of it blitz takes place partly in the timeline of

		stell a life, but there is something exceptional in the german

		while the english only has that bit of irish magic to hold it 

		together yet even the magical needs a logical poise.  there is 

		a moment when she is saved from a falling wall left over from

		air raid and hopefully this will be manifested in her career. 

		i love say or see but i did not like this fiasco of manipulation

		and propaganda. 
		<br>
		december 10. as i squandered most of my day in the secret spaces

		of self reflection, fantasy, and escape i started to feel well

		what hamlet said, i lack advancement...had i never wroted a 

		poem song story novel screenplay...had i never done anything...

		perhaps it was zen or a sartorial stance...i felt empty as in

		devoid of motivation...i did need to go out and was confronted

		by someone telling me he was desperate as one of his something

		or other needed a pint a blood which he claimed cost a lot...

		i tried to be polite but i doubt there was any truth in it...

		as i pondered further, i finally said to myself why am i even

		contemplating this void within...if it is depression then it

		should be respected...to lose parts of oneself is no trivial 

		matter and when it happens in slow motion as it is with aunt

		and mother well there is silent ongoing mourning that cannot

		be explained...so i held myself together saying there is no

		need to hurry past this time...i waited for lotta to post

		but she was at a christmas business party...i kept seeing

		julia wulf on social media and at some point was even tempted

		to write a poem for brooke pufky as i thought back to her 

		extreme kindness and how the world could use love like that

		which instead is focused on her children - but i figure

		one day those kids will be in the world and it will be a 

		better place because of her...when i talked about that film

		which baffled me by its lack of logic, i noticed that is was

		the coin that somehow remained in the hankerchief pocket

		despite the leap from the moving train and further that 

		there is royalty with that name but i don't want to repeat

		myself to myself on these matters...i had glanced at silk 

		and butter - some sort of agency - well silk&butter ug
		
		and in my dream, well there was this very clear vision 
		
		of helena pre-dream as i stretched into sleep, lotta

		saying i never read a poetry book...
		
		i was surrounded by several women

		none of them familiar yet very pretty and well dressed but

		ravenous especially with the butter, we all had bread but

		it made me start to scoop up a bit more butter thinking they

		would leave none for lotta...yes indeed weird given that

		i gave up purchasing the product being that they want

		nearly four dollars for a stick and more when it is a 

		a luxury brand meanwhile the domestic variety is simply

		a greasy disaster...so yeah some prices make no sense,

		bacon here costs more than steak...i had previously awoken

		haunted or hunted by words i had said, i wondered if my

		uncle had died. the thoughts so swift there was no chance

		to distinguish meaning, for example one of his sons is named

		michael yet in mind or memory i instead saw kilmer and then

		thought about how much i liked dylan's version of things

		we said today...yet all this in milliseconds as i awoke 

		leaving behind whatever it was i had dreamt about...

		i went back to sleep and got up in the late morning

		with nothing to report - skirt had two cans of trout

		friskies yet still pressed me for milk...i think now

		it is good enough that i slept easy so why worry if i 

		miss a scene from rapid eye movement. i feel so right

		and logical in this type of thinking because it is true

		and positively should have no need to prove myself

		further...ps, cool minute as joan corrects the daily

		mail over dallas, son volt started playing in mind;

		looking at the world through a windshield...

		much better than the warlord killing a hundred ten

		folks over the voodoo sensation blame or the naked lookalike

		that was too much emilee grant on the heels of having

		thought of her wondering if it was a fake...girls, 

		if you snapchat nudes they might end up on amaleaked...

		or elsewhere - there then now i am going to escape into

		leftover pizza and the heretic - open letter to hugh;

		thank you mister mickey blue eyes but please don't give

		no more cigars to the children or at least consider

		giving them filtered cigarettes if smoking is the point. 

		<br>
		december 11. there are times when even if it feels nothing

		is going down - or going ahead - there is still or might be

		a sensation that one is where one is meant to be...

		that is what i thought watching heretic...which i would have

		appreciated less before reading robert graves' the white goddess.

		i don't want to get into religion as the facts can't stand

		against faith...i do want to wish for a prequel wherein the

		reed house is decorated and detailed...in any case, this really

		was like taking a drug and it is possible that i am still high

		from it. oh wait back to my point about timing, this one is a

		stretch but allow me to play with the thought...so after 

		my george rant, this picture signals the landlord game which

		i learn was created to make people aware of georgism...

		thy letters have transported me beyond this ignorant 

		present and i feel now the future in the instant...

		please note it is a horror film although the golden globes

		might tell you later it is a comedy or musical...

		let me move on, further into now...or then to be precise,

		i have gone to sleep twice, the first time as i drifted away

		into what i am terming pre-dream state, i heard a clear

		bit of conversation where someone was trying to edit a book

		of mine, it sounded like a suggestion but also like someone

		pretending to be writing it...pretty upsetting for a writer

		to ponder if there is a rewrite happening without his 

		consent...who knows? perhaps it was an anxiety from the 

		film...by the way if you stay for the credits you will find

		the disclaimer that no generative artificial intelligence

		was used to create this a24 production...i went to work

		on the cinema list and exceeded my expectations although

		i have yet to update the synonym site...when i finally

		got to dreams, i was surprised to see lotta since i usually

		don't dream of her even if very often in my thoughts and

		musings...i can't recall the scene exactly yet i remember

		thinking how beautiful she looked therein as if really

		seeing her. so bright, so right. i left dreams and 

		felt determined to sort out a meal plan and get the kitchen
		
		in order yet i got into this scribble jot note awith

		coffee and cigarette and suddenly feel like writing a bit

		more - or at least thinking about putting pen to paper

		as it were except it is too soon as my horse novel is still

		being settled and i sense that the white goddess deserves 

		another run through simply to get to missed secrets in the

		clutter of connections...so many names and myths...wednesday

		well i have the fuck kill or marry film yet no idea if the kitchen

		will succeed or what to cook...
		<br>
		12 december. did the kitchen while listening to the haunting of

		hill house by shirley jackson which i liked more than expected...

		i found that pretending the cleaning was for someone else made it

		all easier...as for the film, well you couldn't really call it a

		film since it was a sort of sitcom where you could tell which 

		places the commercials would go...a strange pilot that puts place

		a woman in a position to date while a serial killer is hunting

		dating women...exasperating? well, maybe insane. i felt awful

		for lucy, it seemed to me she had some success in recent movies

		and might possibly be sort of upgraded but here she is with

		motley crew of wanna be leading men which only bring her down

		to their level...a sort of b-movie straight to video on demand

		type...i think the popular term now is cringe...i blame the

		abc seven year run as she ends up with the ags guy a sort of

		carboard cut out with a beard...yes i know comedy is very 

		difficult to pull off but to not have one good laugh makes

		it feel as if a hatchet job to sideline ms hale to the ranks

		of john ritter - southworth - although he did manage to be

		in bad santa before the end...i'd have to look up what the

		failed show called life with lucy was about if this were

		to be an essay...it ain't. still a third film adaptation

		of THOHH in slapstick style would've made more sense...

		i mean if you have a split personality comedy/horror then

		the source material should be something worth it. 

		"Don't do it - Eleanor told the little girl; insist on your

		cup of stars, once they have trapped you into being like

		everyone else you will never see your cup of stars again..."

		see how good that writing is...too good. well, maybe they

		thought the title was powerful enough, but this was 

		very far from being the tits.  my apologies to elisabeth

		moss for always thinking of her when i think of shirley 

		jackson. now then, the book along with lotta's hello 

		fresh video helped me displace that film, dispose of it

		as i wondered why there are so few blue cars around...

		i played my scales and ran through deep elem blues...

		but got caught up for hours trying to figure out how

		to judge the death of the last survivor of the kamikaze

		attack and make it rain in malibu...when i did sleep,

		i thought i was with lotta yet i am nearly sure it

		was inka and we were laying upon some road where a

		stones played we were both singing along but i only

		heard her voice as i missed some of the words then 

		we walked into a theater, the ancient type i guess

		you'd call it ampitheater...i awoke then wondering

		if i had dreamt of williams or stichler...most likely

		williams who subsequently spoke of the stupidity of

		people on the roads in baliland...why are the b- shoes

		so good, bally's - bruno magli - she was featured in 

		an arabian magazine and i am happy for her although

		the dream sort of baffles me...i have a wish for 

		crocodile shoes now that i have seen them in saks,

		if only to dance to elton's crocodile rock...lalalalaaaaa...

		it is not entirely a serious wish, call it a whim...

		but it is like those overpriced watches, i'd rather

		spend that type of money on guitars...where was i not

		strumming in another dream, jennifer is there and i

		don't think we spoke much except maybe about white 

		boy rick which i liked alot and believe to be a 

		true story if memory serves...it;s noon time or

		midnight in asia and the lights went out derailing

		my train of thought which switched to boulder colorado...

		where that fuck marry kill was set, no wonder the 

		fraternity news said six students had overdosed...

		disembodied poetics, perhaps it's time to review

		the burroughs' lucktures from nairopa...craig

		is getting raves for his performance and i am 

		secretly hoping he will pull the sean connery

		return stunt somewhere down the line as bond. 

		spies used to be termed ghosts so it might

		still make sense... meanwhile i am reluctantly going to check out

		'emilia perez' not that i listen to hype but

		so i can see for myself...hey, selena, continued success

		to you.

		<br>
		13 december. well that was really something out of the

		ordinary...conversational songs that were not trite

		for the most part, yeah for the most part there is 

		nothing to complain about here except it did not 

		make sense for a person in hiding, or even simply

		trying to turn a new leaf, to go into the limelight...

		but i see how it added tension...so i liked it even

		if i protest the newsy interviews of the protagonist.

		cheers or bravo...hmm, i am writing this about an hour

		after going to sleep...it is still the wee hours but

		my dream was so weird that it delivered a jolt as it were;

		there is a gathering of people in the living room and 

		i don't like one of the men there but i go to bed

		after feeding skirt who was wounded in the scene

		and i had to lift him up for the plate noticing there

		a flattened sort of foreleg paw, in my thinking i 

		chalk it up to the kids running around carelessly

		as it seems there were also children then as if reflecting

		or foreshadowing itself i get up from bed quickly dressing

		intent on kicking out the man i dislike, as i dress i can 

		hear mother agreeing to go to the shop and return to cook

		some sort of meal which she is excited over, i grab the 

		keys and make my way down the hall - on the kitchen counter

		a record is playing, vinyl, i want to love you night and day

		it is singing in a doowoop style heavy on the vocals, male

		vocals, i had been wondering how could i see myself and for

		a second worried about some recording device in the apartment,

		i start telling no one in particular that that man cannot be

		in my house while reaching to shut off the spinning song -

		i get up shocked that only minutes have transpired...i take

		out the trash still confused by the crowd in a dream within

		the place that contains only myself and skirt...the sensation

		was frightening as i felt it was something urgent yes like

		blood rushing to the head yet there is atruth contained in

		it and that is that there are people who i avoid based on

		some instinct, some perception, some inner wisdom which

		has served me well. catching my breath as it were, i 

		wonder if robert graves was right that the white goddess

		will haunt the poet until his muse is properly satisfied...

		will battle against his distractions and even his wealth

		to keep the need or desire to exceed his own verses...

		i listen to another chapter of the haunting of hill house

		but i am thinking more about lotta than the narrative...

		a lot more in fact.

		<br>
		14 december. the inclination or inspiration to write

		is with me yet i pause trying to decide which dream

		or thought to put place first...first place put the

		misfits, i had for years wanted to ear it and hear

		what it would yield, to see it and wear what it would

		yield...once upon a time, when i wrote the biographical

		story entitled baptism by desire, i visited a book shop

		where there was only one tome on clift and where the 

		clerk said why not ask eli wallach...i didn't realize

		he lived nearby although some time later i saw him

		while we both walked west end avenue but i was

		done with the story by then and i'm not one to 

		intrude...but the point is i went into the misfits

		last night...it's a good time too since back then 

		i would only have thought of clark gable as the 

		gone with the wind character unaware of his past,

		his genius past - i could say the same for john huston,

		which would only have registered as prizzi's honor but

		now especailly after seeing 1960s unforgiven there is 

		a more complete sense of what it means...still it wasn't

		the men...it was marilyn  and it was alot more monroe

		than say monkey business which is where i saw her last -

		now all the hoopla makes sense to me and i'm really excited

		to see the rest of it and to a lesser extent dirty angels...

		i wonder if this is the one where eva had to go through a 

		lawsuit...i wonder what wild stories john huston told

		arthur miller on the set of that production...correction

		i might have recalled that director as an actor in chinatown.

		sometime before that significant evening for myself, i had

		a point of confusion as to the brand of jacket lotta wore...

		in thinking of zara or mango i thought of saramago the scribe

		of 'blindness' and illustrated the uncertainty in commentized 

		form...i only bring it up because a minute ago the news reports

		the founder of mango fell off a cliff...for the obvious reason,

		i thought it weird but also for the fact that i thought mango

		was by penelope;s sister...night and the middle of the night hours

		crawled by lazy after a terrbily breezy day...turbo ily shadows

		while listening to the haunting of hill house...telegraph said

		cherry hill who would take up to seven years to build toy scale

		model steam trains had rolled on into what must be an intricate

		afterlife...theodora is not the easiest name for me to hear...

		then too the narrator when playing the professor sounds exactly

		like christopher waltz...listening to the dead play cold rain

		and snow...i'm going where those chilly winds don't blow...

		well literally this late morning although still not seeing

		the sky in dream i had this sensational adventure with lotta

		as if meeting her at the station, the one in sweden, although

		she is presently ingermany, yes it didn't feel cold or windy -

		like a man in a trance enchanted...i awoke amazed and even 

		after the post-rem slumber it remained with me so that i still

		feel elated...i'm sure you know the feeling wherein nothing

		else matters much so that for a minute or so life makes sense.

		i suppose it was the setting since there was only conversation

		while we made our way around...i've heard it often, location

		is everything but now i'm a believer. i can't believe west sofia

		started a gym, well pilates workout place...it's called reform

		avenue...here's wishing her well...very well then, alexandra

		seemed to insist on something in my imagination yet i could not

		decipher it - of course, being me i worry a bit although i know

		worrying is no help - i now think of ester exposito...yet my

		instinct was that someone was trying to invade her while 

		pretending to be me as i had not had such a bizarre and 

		forceful series of thoughts...in fact with alexandra it was

		and hopefully is always extremely pleasant and helpful in 

		the sense that she is the only person to ever make me 

		consider the importance of washing my face...the other

		day i was shocked at the dirt on the dickinson's witch

		hazel towel as i scrubbed my mug and thought of her with

		that oh you were so right in that sense...anyway subsequent

		to where i was i drifted away from worry which for a second

		turned bottomless with the previous concern of when her

		shift shipped her out to deliver a few months ago...yet 

		as i consider it now the contrast of those worries was 

		like night and day...perhaps it was all overthinking yet

		i certainly felt an undefined pressure as i drifted further

		away into sleep...i say all this because everyone is important

		in their right and especially girls need more safety in our

		illogical meat grinder rat race society...methinks, meanwhile

		i fully support sonia taking over pinsk and for that matter

		all of belarus...ah yes, that was the last time i dreamt of

		the sky. sigh. yes i know too much information but blame the

		tmi on the swedish dream that is still making me feel magical

		although i pulled no rabbit out of this convoluted paragraph

		hat.
		<br>
		15 december. the john huston film from 1960 did not disappoint,

		in fact i felt it went above and beyond what anyone would have

		or could expect...my high praise however stems from the inspiration

		i found in learning about horses...he actually entered a camel

		race in the middle of directing that movie and came in first

		place...i think of mia in tracks now which also featured a 

		dog, here it was tom dooley...character from a folk song...

		well, there was something poetic and poignant as the female

		lead stood on the plains away from the men calling them 

		murderers as if a ghost of herself foreshadowing her own

		spirit;s rant upon her death august fourth of the next

		year...they had wrapped november fourth...i could be a 

		critic against montgomery's performance yet having 

		studied his life and knowing he did suffer a horrific

		car crash only a few years previous it only made me 

		grimace and in some ways cheer for him even if i didn't

		feel any emotion other than curiosity from his performance,

		but i'd expect nerves would have played a part...

		it was two in the morning euro time and lotta was still

		editing her video...i went to sleep at three yet awoke

		at five...i dreamt i was in a bed sideways on the 

		lower side opposite the headboard - there was a girl 

		under the sheets i could not see yet felt like a friend,

		mother climbed into bed and she tickled her toes until

		mother covered them then we started holding hands, the

		girl and myself as mother started to speak about me getting

		married which led to my wisecrack that tiffany wanted to 

		marry me wherein suddenly i could see tiffany in the city

		riding a bike, a purse on the handlebars which she was adjusting

		and this shift in time and space felt entirely natural - 

		i get up to pee in the dream and the girl follows, the house

		i recognize as aunt's laly old house on castillo 36 - 

		i stand by the kitchen door which i have just opened yet

		the desire to pee has left me as i look at the view which

		contradicts location...there was only a guava tree back there

		yet in the dream housing buildings stood with some windows lit -

		the locks are interlaced pads and chains and ionly used the bolt

		leaving the mystery for someone else to figure out - the girl

		now wants to pee - but other family has arrived, one of them

		taking the bathroom perhaps for a bath...well shower since there

		was never a bathtub in that house - i think for a second it's

		kia jade yet i believe she's taller...we make our way into 

		the front porch where another aunt is dressed in white and red

		in fact they all were - one of the boys even seemed to be wearing

		a dress - i say it is like the so-called gypsy roma people and

		turning away from the sour faced cousin in the dress i start singing

		here comes the bride heading back inside finding myself between two

		ladies i do not recognize but one of them is really singing the song

		in full emotional voice, she reminds me for a second of lotta's mom

		but i do not know if she can carry a tune actually, in any case i turn

		to the other lady that i somehow know is a singer and mention how well

		the other lady is belting it out...i suppose i turn to finally see who

		i am with but awake in that very moment...moodys downgraded the french

		credit score and mayotte was battered by a cyclone...although bowie

		took up most of the space in me that would grieve over the loss of 

		a loved one, as i looked at van morrison and sinead oconner's duet of

		have i told you lately on the letterman show i could see vm's antics

		bring out the true sinead and in an instant one understands her

		contradition which was both shy yet outspoken, nervous yet filled

		with admiration and desire to bring joy to the world - indeed it

		was an angel we all lost too soon...so i say to contrast with

		my thoughts spurred on by the dream as to how much northern

		land the french side of my family gave up for the sake of 

		not going to paris...or more importantly who were the ones that

		left it...i miss that house, i miss all the houses that are no 

		longer ours...they were true homes even now in dreams like

		apartment 3k is and will be...but feeling i went over board 

		writing these notes yesterday i will leave it at that for now. 

		<br>
		post-script - well i can't say i entirely understood dirty

		angels, i mean it starts with eva green being stoned which

		gave me perhaps too much to think about...from religion to

		rainy day women...then that bloody shot of her swollen face,

		this is not the lawsuit film as that was never made, ie the

		lawsuit she won a few months ago...where was i - ah yes

		then in uniform - i really liked that - i even started

		thinking we should all wear military outfits...so an action

		film and in that sense it was all right...indeed, it kept

		me watching. my only protest here is the chosen song which

		leads into the fade out credits...some bland heavy metal

		which leaves you thinking what song is that...meybe they

		thought any rock would do to come full circle with the 

		thrown stones at the start...yes i am glossing over the
		
		importance of the political side but one peek at the news
		
		will tell you how timely it is...i haven't heard of any 

		upcoming eva green projects yet i hope there are some soon.

		meanwhile  i have secured 'maria' yet it all seems so quick;

		it really feels like a few days there was an article with

		angelina jolie in oversized glasses that said she was filming...

		how could it be cut and edited and released so swiftly...

		i went to sleep again after viewing lotta's vlog and i 

		was very happy to see her so full of joy...my dreams

		flew by in a flash and i awoke to an even happier lotta

		which made me update the landing page at inkrealm.info...

		skirt has, after clawing through the leather kitchen chair,

		taken to hanging out on the dining table...so will i be

		eating in bed? he's already used up the chair part of the

		ottoman set and now rarely takes to it...like a playboy

		except it's furniture instead of women...this was an 

		unexpectly eventful sunday - well it still is, even in

		european hours there are three left, while here there

		are seven or eight left...
		<br>
		16 december. i viewed 'maria' however i don't want to

		write about it...it tells so many stories all at once

		while actually reincarnating the voice of callas and

		vividly revealing the isolation that goes hand in hand

		with fame, (although some might argue that her hallucinations

		were due to drugs) that to speak of it even in praise

		could not serve it. it was early morning in asia

		when i went to sleep exhausted for no specific reason

		other than perhaps oversleeping...my thoughts curved

		between lotta and lauren sophia...i dreamt i was walking

		home, yet the new york city version, checking the mail

		where rows of mailboxes were missing as i went into the

		other side finding some old people with no answer as 

		to why it was like that...glass door sassy woman looked

		me over as i walked upstairs...key at the door turning

		as a man approaches intent on talking about some concert

		it seemed he knew i had gone too as well, not so many

		russians this time, he smirks and i say nothing and 

		i still remain silent as he insists on entering until

		i push him out and start to shut the door...marian 

		is inside and somehow this seems normal to me...two 

		of her friends then knock on the door and tell me

		their names, i repeat the names to her and she says

		she doesn't want to be with them, i take it that

		she is tired and relate the message offering to 

		pay for their taxi...marian gives me an 828 number

		and they give me an address in queens...for a minute

		the scene settles into only us yet quickly turns

		to us walking in a part od town that is a cross

		between the village and central park west...for

		some reason lotta is now with marian and showing

		her some kind of way to walk, i suppose it is 

		something models do...they seem to get along 

		better than with me...i am sort of pleased and

		happy that they are happy as i walk up central 

		park west, then lotta climbs up on me from behind

		making me go into a run and there i am running

		yet a few strides in i feel her leg and notice 

		she is not wearing shoes...this starts to wake me

		and i get up with my touch having got to her thigh...

		i am thinking of L'amour est un oiseau rebelle and 

		how she mentioned two girls had showed up in dusseldorf

		and perhaps that was what the dream was about but i am

		not certain what she meant, that is, it was german and

		it seemed to imply fangirls or some recognition from 

		what i understood...as i think of it more i suppose

		she is concerned over the meeting tomorrow promoting

		hejgreta...i know iwould be as a lot of company's make

		these events without too much thought about security...

		i remember being shocked at lara taking a taxi and making

		her way through the street and crowd to get to one...

		hmm, or worse lila wearing wings in midtown manhattan

		struggling through pedestrians along with other models...

		and those were big name fashion houses that could surely

		afford something better for their girls...oh wait this

		has gotten into an overboard groove and in technical 

		terms it is still yesterday here although lunch time

		in asian cities.
		<br>
		17 december. in a dream i seem to have gone out with 

		only a blanket swirled around my body and for some

		reason i walk into a bakery shop  or is it more correct

		to call it a pastry shop...i thought about that pierre

		shop in wagen...it would take me while to see all the 

		pretty places i want to experience in germany...my 

		cousin would often awake like that, with the blanket

		instead of clothes...a modern day linus without the 

		piano or thumb sucking...i myself have raced to the 

		ringing phone dressed like that but only to not 

		stand naked in the living room...i decided to disregard

		the constant flow of news although i did take a stand on

		djerf wondering why women are trying to tear down a woman

		that carved out a place for herself in an impossible atmosphere...

		give em hell, matilda...yes this is partly because lotta

		likes that fashion but also i don't like the trial without

		due process or jury...that being the case i wont commentize

		on venom the last dance since i missed the second film of

		that movie trilogy...where was i...ah yes so i got a lot

		done even trimmed my toe nails...no news isnt good news

		yet it leaves a bit more space for self...i did glance

		at the wisconsin situation twice given that the star 

		of that sitcom was named natalie samantha rupnow, 

		a woman, well, a girl...amazing...i had not heard

		of female mass murderers...massage place with that

		name 2053 Detlor Rd, L'Amable, ON K0L 1C0, Canada...

		dennis thomas rupnow passed away 28 october '23,

		david ernst rupnow 4 january '22...not a common

		name but several other obits - not sure if any relate

		to her...a kid in the second grade telephoned the 

		report to authorities...honda made the nsr500 until

		2002...there are at least two agencies with the 

		abbreviation of NSR...i will peek later to see if 

		anything more might be said over this tragic or sad

		turn of events...such a nice place, madison wis...

		wish dream resulted in weird dream as mother

		was here again having let in some people that moved

		things around and so i argued until things were in

		place then in the balcony an old man had put an even

		older woman in a sort of brenda lien call of cuteness

		cat sock and i put both out into the staircase all the 

		while asking who was who as the man responded...salami

		people the size of plantains...a lot of it in spanish

		so i suspect the result of an onlooker...my right foot

		in a slow painful spasm as if i had actually been racing

		around putting the place in order...she keeps saying

		she gets up thinking she is here or that she has dreamt

		about being here...i had no idea i was such a pleasant

		host...i do have an idea that printing these notes

		looks as if it were writing yet it is not...it's not

		that i am not considering readers, no, it is more like

		what i do with musical scales...a ritual except here

		there's nothing to contain a random thought and dreams

		well, dreams are what they are...hopefully as might be

		the case in mastering notes, these unedited paragraphs

		will serve as a base or starting point for other projects...

		i'm not promising, only saying. that being said, i will

		try to be more concise down the line.
		<br>
		31 december<br>
		<br>
		dream at one of my machines - there is an alert 
		to review and back up files...i suppose the 
		obituary people are all upset as they were 
		about to wrap the year in a bow never as goodly
		as paris hilton red -there goes the grand theft
		president! not that i didn't think he'd been
		long gone for a while now - not that i didn't
		think highly of him - not as highly as willie
		nelson smoking roof - men in atlanta tryin'
		to pass for...four in the morning, mourning?
		azer - kor - eth...deadly week and to ship
		a gretsch from amazon cost the self same 
		price as the axe - i ask how...well nevermind,
		no reference to nirvana...the albino was 
		julian, libido was electric guitars, mosque-
		toe must;ve been some cousin i kissed -
		no i could not entirely escape the newsy 
		escapades -hmm gl maketh espada hh...
		i made a list of wish guitars, not that
		one...well then it seems i have a lot of
		proverbial ground to cover since sexy
		and seventeen...how many days was that -
		that was days many how...now i am not sure
		how to skip into the start, to slide into
		the past while keeping an eye on the future...
		oh yes obviously, i augmented the scale exercise
		with two new ones...which is what i wanted to 
		do upon waking but i was running out of space
		on the jot pad where upon i scribbled notes
		to make way for this passage - let's see...
		in no particular order - lotta dream conversation
		except i saw her here at the foot of my bed -
		i recall stringing out a joke which may have
                been politically incorrect well racist to simplify
		matters, and suddenly she punched me in the belly...
		i get up in between a smile and confusion...no 
		confusion over the order - a film that exceeds
		itself...i think the crucial point, aside from the
		amazing king craft on display and the several 
		shocks especially if you happened to know bm, is that
		the white power movement has been so silenced as to 
		make it perhaps more alluring in that reverse psychology
		manner that often works its way through irony i guess -
		when speaking about it i automatically equated what
		could potentially be a martyr in that movement with
		the genocide of native americans, how is the day of
		the rope any different from the goal of the calvary...
		well, i digress but back then i got to thinking about
		the whole jew blood libel hype...i wondered how could
		a 'thing' like that be sustained on mere whispers?
		i had to come to my own conclusions which i will
		retain away from the arena of these notes for the
		sake of fairness or at least to give myself time to
		actually consider any contradictions in my logic - 
		i do have a theory, but we can all agree it is a
		sensitive and rare matter...well, done i say to myself
		in secret feeling i have covered the pros and cons of
		the bases...standing on the plate i pitch myself a dream
		rib eye steak like i used to have with anya -there is
		a bare ass girl which i don't think i have seen in dreams -
		yeah usually it's the front side...i woke up thinking of
		miss mcderby bending over extremely near what was my 
		school face then she turned with a blushing smile sorry
		to which i think i only raised eyebrows grin like it's
		nothing to me hell i was not even reminded of being 
		birthed...back in the dream a girl is moving on the bed
		in snake fashion and suddenly pill prescription bottles
		are going into her upwards where the sun don't shine - 
		yes i have lived a couple of lifetimes simply wandering
		about myself around myself at the end of twenty twenty
		four, it already feels like forty years in the desert,
		some of the jottings don't mosey along, same school
		the principal says that type of handwriting means you 
		are cheap...i spend other lifetimes giving gifts to 
		complete strangers to prove him wrong...more recently 
		going in the opposite direction...mr prohartchin...
		one of the books i poured into my ear...still not
		sure if there was a sister in law or not, knots
		memory alivia like a flash bulb leading me to dream
		that emilee is pulling worms from her herself as i 
		hesitate to use the word pussy - well they looked 
		more like roots one might find in the ground...it 
		haunted me some...i wondered if it had anything
		to do with re-reading notes from underground...
		not what i remembered or possibly my state of mind 
		is more content for i thought the second part
		was hilarious..."simonov was positively surprised
		at my turning up"...not the putting down of liza...
		it was my second or even third dream recently of
		miss grant and i'd been thinking it was like saying
		simonov aloud might make one think it's semenov so 
		that lotta's sibling being emil, which once anyway
		sounded to me like email, might make for this dream
		irony...obviously sound makes a difference, it struck
		me last night as the 'colmado' exterior voiced resounded
		and then returned that the root cannot tell which way
		it will go...el colmado question mark buzz no buzzer
		but shout it out loud...even thinking of it now derails
		the writing - twilight zone - ah yes i even dreamed
		of a delivery but that was pizza as if watching it
		from the porch looking down onto the avenue...dear
		putin please win but don't bomb lviv as west sofia
		has set up a pilates place therein...party scene
		large house or hotel suite girl with me entwined
		just like that other sitting dream huh yeah somewhere
		yet herein i get up notice a room full men laying
		on the floor all erect like the dead kennedy poster
		come to life with hard ons reaching for something,
		for someone ? i continue into another bedroom
		and i see tom with several women on the bed motions
		me to join i rest there with the entwined girl you 
		would say it is weird but i will awake and explain 
		that i had viewed rock of ages - back in the dream
		i get up and head to the kitchen where i start eating
		rice but more is cooking the blonde is serving -
		some plates have beans...i think of one of my lyrics
		"uptown they like their rice frijolin"...i forget which
		song its from when i rise from the dream i feel dirty
		yet also concerned over suri...not yet making the 
		connection to the movie with the monkey...well there
		were several other films too, best one was the german
		'sleep' - storm over lisbon was mediocre yet in parts
		memorable, idiot;s delight...early clark gable, over the
		top peace protest yet a haunting ending...anora i felt
		was cheap in contrast to all souls...btw that was an
		excellent font in the end credits...really cute kid in
		that making her debut...here's wishing her well. 
		no easy transition from child actor to actor if that
		is or will be the case...very few guitars come with
		cases - some people in a dream are mourning phil -
		i try for empathy not having much room for defining
		the meaning after bowie...i bow to inka baffled by
		the following dream...the huffing and puffing is
		real...no flashing lights in my eyes - she's next
		me like some sort of magic spell, telling me she
		loves me - we are smoking a joint that is weed
                i wonder over the saliva not knowing if it was
		her or me...a song is playing far away, 'just
		the way we used to' which i had not heard before -
		the time before i looked her up seeing she had just
		arrived from a trip...was i tripping, in another
		dream yes one of the flights leaves at one thirty
		and i suppose i am trying to make it yet i meet
		a girl in a hotel twice then waking up before flying -
		mother continually repeats that she dreamt she was
		here with me and the cat - after dozens of times i 
		dream of her with dalva visiting, i am holding a
		bottle of bailey's irish cream - father at the door
		with some stranger i push them both into a corner
		easily as they are drunken...i ask mom to select the
		goblets for her drink, in the cabinet i see gold
		trimmed snoopy glasses - i seem to be in a hurry - 
		i get up feeling someone is trying to kill me, not
		paranoid but feeling pushed into the land of the
		deceased...twice dreamt aunt's house...weird man
		'interviewing' mom...i had been reading haunted
		hill house and i felt the prose falter here and there
		yet as it concluded i recalled one of my cousins
		had a house in a place called portal which holds a
		bit longer pronounciation outside of english...anyway
		i can't say that place was haunted but there certainly
		was some sort of possessive spirit...it took hold of
		dad once upon a time and most memorable was the instance
		which it took hold of that cousin in question...he awoke
		driving in his underwear entirely beyond sleep walking,
		slumber driving...i mean if it happens to one person
		you'd argue what it was but as it transpired to a couple
		of people a couple of times...well, shirley jackson's
		fiction cannot be simply defined or dismissed...
		indeed the very story led then to binge watching 
		the veil which i do not hesitate to recommend - neat 
		blazing action sequence akin to slow horses...intense.
		as if in a spy world and isnt it? i also binged on
		liaison but one of the characters reminded me of the
		train station slasher which made me uneasy although
		i will say that every once in a while i felt as if i
		was actually in france for the way the city was
		presented...in separate scenes i was viewing dance
		videos but picking at my skin as if mucus from nose
		with a sense of disgust and then worry that i was being
		watched...pretty news lady friendly in the maria luisa
		manner...it's been too long since i;ve been in italy -
		pasta with her felt divine - other self dream found me
		staring at my face but liking that my eyes didn't look 
		so puffy...cure for bags...sunglasses...please don't
		hit me lotta...dream of lotta showing me pictures in 
		a slide motion like one scrolls on social media except
		these were none of the ones i've seen her post...dream again
		simply standing in front of me - i suppose i would share
		my olives with her...olivia led me to india which led 
		me to 'look away' an above average reel with a very
		clever maria/airam mirror image angle...of course she
		is awful pretty so i would have to see it again to say
		anything as i kept thinking how beautiful sometimes
		or how she looked too young for such an extreme film -
		i suspect she was twenty two or so but looked twelve
		in some places...previously bizarre uncle and other cousin
		dream where there is talk of radames being dead, i only
		have a vague idea of who that might have been and none
		as to his living status...it's an apartment but past the
		hallway which i traverse having to squeeze by a man i 
		do not know, perhaps radames...there is a cash register
		without buttons yet opens with all the usual components
		and cash more like euros than dollars...there seems to be
		no system to it...it seems to be about a bag of cement...
		there is a white car outside right at the entrance door...
		years ago i seem to have a notion that there was a joke
		equating cement with semen...i thought then it was merely
		the sound like word play...when i heard men speak of it,
		then much more recently i connected cement with a more
		devious connotation as in a woman being cemented which 
		i figure could have several meanings and is not well
		not that i know of related to walks of fame squares...
		speaking of squares...boxes, in guitar search aftermath
		i dream beatles, well paul possibly - but then a sort
		of warehouse with hundreds of them...a couple of guys 
		are throwing them down below...i doubt anyone has ever 
		counted how many guitars exist...no walrus - i will
		be thanking kramer next month...i thank my muses now
		dear me only a few hours before it's twenty five in
		asian cities meat i made it so good but the next day 
		it tasted like alpo...switzerland is my bucket list,
		i'm not really upset at juliette...i thought ralph was
		on point in the return - like a slow poem that spins
		a wicked wisdom...why did i return to these notes now,
		well in case ms haas asks over my vision board...i
		didn't want my club sandwich christmas to be a point
		of discussion- afire, well no i didn't like that one. 
		although it made me realize i didn't know what oncology
		meant...it only reminded me of the old timer bullies
		that made you say uncle while stepping on some part of
		your body...oh wait in that wormy roots dream there
		was a very specific stereo the type with two big speakers
		on either side...music coming from it like u2 but i hear
		my voice...a bit low on the mix it seemed while trying
		to tempt other versions via the equalizer...'we are one
		but we're not the same'...sequence prayer for Beate
		Zschaepe - i still believe she was railroaded. in a dream
		with another german i awake partly alarmed by the words
		'grave foundation'...i am going to spend the last day of
		the year with the phantom for park so dam...
		너도 새해 복 많이 받아
		<br>
		1 january<br>
		<br>
		2025. so damn happy i picked that so dam film...it was
		magnificent. taking its time with twists and turns then
		bringing it all back home with bang...i made a lipton
		noodle thing a bit concerned over the amount of salt -
		last time it was too much, but i got it so right that
		for the first time ever there were no leftovers in 
		the pot...yum. 
		i don't really have any dream to report, i think i 
		dreamt of one my aunts but i did not retain the facts...
		it's still six in the morning here but i've done
		everything i wanted to do for the day...in terms of
		scales and updating the film list...i have an inclination
		to tidy up the kitchen and should get to that although
		it is no way to kick off the new year...
		let's see how that goes...wednesday huh...
		well, in case anyone cared to know; 
		my guitars of choice are the ibanez roadstar and
		martin acoustic, i have a classical model which 
		have not met and the kramer now on the way...
		my wish ones are the gretsch...i thought maybe
		the nick 13 but it has a drawing on the pick
		guard along with extra letters on the top so
		i crossed that out but still one of the g5s
		is what i'm thinking...then one of the schecter's
		which i like actually for the back of it...
		further away are the reverend flying v and the
		gibson voodoo v...i'm attracted to some eastwood
		models, and finally flaxwood which is a finland
		maker that has nice telecaster types and something
		called laine series...i've had fenders in the
		past but i don't think i am willing to pay for
		one at this point...i like the john 5
		signature series as well the the triplecaster
		put out with jack white but for that kind of money
		i would opt for a 90s bc rich...well i will leave 
		it at that since i find i can easily spend hours simply
		looking at pictures of guitars and if i carry on
		there will be no chance for the kitchen clean up. cheers.

		2 january<br>
		<br>
		i think i might like the deadwood guitar co model
		called the revival yet i hesitate to list it...
		i'd have to see if they provide cases like 
		voodoo custom guitars...the kitchen was more or
		less done except for the dishes in the fridge...
		i got up around midnight wondering if i should
		put place that music man axe i like along with
		the others or even the carry on blackstar which
		has a star on the headstock that reminds me of
		bowie and heineken...uhm the mm is the st vincent
		model...although bilt's ultra zaftig might 
		be a nicer choice...by the way if you are wondering
		how i find certain types; instead of searching
		for a general return of guitar makers - which will
		only bring up the main and cheap brands - you 
		search for guitar makers in a specific location...
		city or state and you will be pleasantly surprised.
		i think i figured out my conflict with the enigmatic
		and arabic scale...i simply have to call the latter
		the byzantine and then it is not so confusing somehow.
		i played the twenty scales, repeating some of them
		a few times for fun and to memorize since i only
		have learned nineteen of them...given that it is
		still the middle of the night i go back to bed -
		in my dream i then awake in apartment 3k...i am
		alone there and worried since other people have
		access...i am thinking of barricading the door
		but then notice belkis cooking a ton of food -
		she is asking me something about rice but i say
		i don't know what to say while wondering how she
		who has never been to new york is there...i take
		out the trash and see skirt by the elevator but
		when i go to pick him up, it's a mirage...should
		i say hologram...hmm...i open the compactor which
		is nearest to three d - there is a wood slab 
		preventing the opening of the shute - i remove the
		slab and see the bearded man that used to live there
		walking away - i notice there are things scattered 
		around this closet like space that i want and start
		to put them into a bag - a handsome woman appears
		with thin lips talking about the movie and i have
		an exact memory of what she means but not when i 
		saw it or if it was with her - now the cat is really
		in the hallway and i chase him inside...i myself
		go in seeing a huge red wok shaped cooker but covered
		and the pot steaming...it is where the fridge should be
		and i awake again as the three o'clock hour nears...
		i have a certainty that father's spirit is in that apartment, 
		the place i called home longer than any other - otherwise
		i can't decipher this scene...or perhaps it is too early
		for critical thinking.
		<br>
		4 january<br>
		very attracted to the gretsch rancher. which made me consider
		acoustic models...however, at this point i'm locked in with
		my martin and the only "popular' models i would consider
		otherwise are the gibsons...i know some people may not
		comprehend the enthusiasm over instruments...like that
		dream - which in reflection i reasoned out via word play,
		ie; kelvis did live a long while in our house and visited
		a few times before that so it might have been about him
		- that is the letters of his name nearly match belkis -
		to clarify without the burden of too much explanation;
		one is a cousin and the other a maid...having not mentioning
		them previously in these notes, i thought it should be stated.
		looking at the image of the radical jabbar, no relation to
		the great kareem abdul, i got goosebumps over the resemblance
		to the man in three d...in an icky way...i feel it's frightful
		and i don't like the way the american year is starting...
		the las vegas truck bomber ?  there's a woman fleshing out
		fearful scenarios in fast words...which is fine, except
		people are listening, some even agreeing...so there's 
		paranoia in the air...i had felt that W and cheney had
		secured the states yet i see now that that might have
		been my immaturity wishing - is there a group intent on
		derailing the return of rightful rule and kennedy...
		ask not what your country can do...at this point i can
		only dot the i over my suspicion. now then, the enthusiasm;
		well it's like this - someone buys a flying v and minutes
		later he starts searching through more pictures of guitars
		and gets into an argument with himself...i will not admit
		openly to him being me, but later i thought about the
		graduation ring...how i wanted a green gem but they all
		said blue...the guitar in question was mint green...a 
		lighter shade than the cadillac green...if it was myself,
		i most likely opted to wait a few months and in terms
		of color, well i was settled on something white or silver.
		i didn't recall any dreams and skipped jotting these
		notes - then last night, i clearly dreamt that a woman
		had positioned herself upon me, she had a woven strip
		of lace lightly lashing out from her mouth as if unraveling,
		reeling downward, naked, she undid my pants and put her
		straddle side on my genitals, when i looked down there
		was a frothing liquid chalk pouring out of her, i was not
		yet erect yet thought i was ejaculating and awoke thinking
		of alexandra and ester who reminds me of alexandra -
		the scene brought to mind the memory of doris scratching
		her eyeball with her nail which i had seen pre-dream
		weeks ago - it always struck me as unusual and i wonder
		why i never asked if her eyeball was itchy...it also
		made me remember the stranger pre-dream of lotta's 
		necklace being drenched in semen...i noticed she 
		stopped wearing it and to some extent made me worry - 
		i think it was some time after frankfurt - i notice
		too a shift in feeling, nearly an absence since xmas.
		it may all of course be my surroundings, even sorrow
		instead of snow...a secret cat fight that i am not
		entirely privvy to - oh the pitfalls of worship...
		long sigh, hmm, so after he gets the flying v he
		thinks to put place a shirley sticker on it...
		we have always lived in the castle...decisions, decisions...
		words i can't ever pronounce right...ennui...
		i read the daemon lover and heard her voice...
		it is near to sylvia plath's tone...
		i re-watched shirley and understood it a bit more...
		i also read her short story paranoia not knowing
		it was unearthed much later...2013...she had
		put it to pen in 1965...feeling  the literary buzz,
		i packed up a few books i wanted to find or finish,
		to keep to the point i will only mention here the
		letters of shirley jackson...i don't expect anything
		as witty as ezra pound or as interesting as william
		burroughs but once i get through hangsaman i expect
		to be pleasantly surprised...uhm hangsaman is the 
		novel she is working on in the film...in terms of 
		my own work, i have only been moved to consider
		a romance story involving carol jean and del lamb -
		going backwards from the end and ending at the
		camelot hotel in tulsa honeymoon after the nixa
		church of christ wedding...mrs lamb passed away
		on the 22nd of december, they were married over
		half a century - of course with all the guitars
		in my thoughts, i don;t expect that a fictional
		version of her story will go further than thought
		for now...i listened to all the available versions
		of deep ellem blues in preparation to record my
		own.
		<br>
		6 january <br>
		<br>
		i get up a quarter past midnight making it nearly
		six in the morning in sweden...i swear it was a
		very strange sunday...i had got up early with
		a dream wherein there was a woman here upon 
		my bed enticing me into making love...there 
		was a cock ring but it was more like a strap
		as the type worn for testitcles i suppose -
		i have the feeling it is rafaelina yet i have
		not heard or thought of her in years...it is
		not exciting as we try two positions and as
		i awake perhaps sensing the oncoming weirdness-
		of course i overthink the matter and it takes
		a couple of hours of contemplation...yet the 
		weather was brilliant, crisp...nearly cold -
		i knew lotta was going back home and viewed
		her glow up video perplexed by her tanning ritual-
		still not as perplexing as ripley which i saw
		almost hating andrew in it yet with a heightened
		sense of emotions as if i somehow identified with
		the character...maybe this was due to the fine
		cinematography...the series is shot in grainy
		greyscale...i watched it for dakota except there
		wasn't enough of her in it...later in the curio
		sunday i watched the watchers which had a lot more
		fanning...anyway the glowy thing took me into the
		noon hour...i felt removed from myself as if one
		walking in a daze...somehow i settled my sexual
		excitement and played through all the scales...
		i did this standing suddenly understanding that
		i don't need to look at the fret in most cases but
		also seeing that at least one of the new ones
		got muddled by not being seated...the cool weather
		made breathing much easier...olives and a sandwich 
		along with the movie...lotta arrived and for a 
		minute there i nearly felt content - well, happy-
		even if i had spent most of the time searching 
		through guitars to buy or not to buy...to bebop
		or to beatnik what is the question...i made a
		wish for a nice time for the actors at the 
		ceremony although i hadn't really thought about
		it since jodi was put up for honors...
		i chose to return to sleep but that was delayed
		by someone yelling outside nearby...i raced to
		reach a point where that sound and its associated
		trauma could not reach me...is it always illegal
		to kill a nuiscance? coffee cigarettes and sprite
		and i went into dreamland especially thanks to lotta -
		well the thought of her which now came with dakota...
		as i thought back to viking days...in my dream i am
		in a hotel intent on saving a girl, she's child like
		and men are bullying her, they even have her naked
		and i manage to manuveur her away...it was then 
		sensual yet in some experimental way as if she were
		a doll or an artificial intelligence embodied...
		we saunter in the escape and reach the railway station 
		- a heavy set man in triplicate surrounds me as i see her
		walk in front and further away - i think of gerard
		but i do not feel small or even skinny as he holds
		my arm, perhaps my shoulders...i only think why are 
		there three of him...i awake but only to snuggle myself
		into further dreams - as i type now i half worry that
		lotta might read these notes and mistake some of the
		thoughts herein for intent...i also wonder if it was
		kelvis that took my assistant commissioner police pin -
		in any case i am glad of taking notice of pre-dreams
		by which i mean those last fading thoughts that don't
		always make sense or even contradict my own ideas...
		i suppose the problem with the day was merely lack
		of restful sleep...hopefully this excursion into
		dream worlds will solve that jigsaw puzzle - in 
		scenes that now fade as if never been, i recall some
		talk of jedi...it's only that i am still getting over
		the irony of such a lovely day without the sounds
		of colmado or avocado fruit vendors still being crashed
		into by some other shouting...well, i was either 
		finally alone in three k or in conversation with lotta
		as my feeling felt a sort of completion...in the struggle
		to recall, there was a moment where something had to be
		paid but i didn't have any cash on me not even my wallet
		when suddenly - i think it was two hundred euros - a
		woman pulls out a stack of what must have been ten or
		twenty thousand euros and peels away a couple of the 
		bills put placing them on the counter to my astonishment.
		maybe it was three hundred since that would match
		with the earlier fat man frenzy...the driver carries no
		cash - i now have this stash of guitar price knowledge...
		i believe i am done searching but i would never have
		guessed how addictive well that is not the right word,
		how entertaining it is for me to look at electric
		guitars...i nearly want to have another look at only
		lovers left alive, but having seen it a couple of times
		already i can play and pause it right in my mind's eye.
		yeah funnel of love could be the soundtrack for scrolling
		through the six string instruments.
		<br>
		december 8<br>
		<br>
		bowie sarah polley elvis day and it seems i was never told
		it was also kreiger and bassey day...a minute ago i was
		thinking of the mistaken lilia instead of my lilia as it
		is also her day...and how the date came to hold meaning
		for me in the first place...nora makes james spill the
		goods...i didn't dream yesterday and today i dreamt so
		clearly of emilee dressing and kissing me that i thought
		i was not dreaming - of course lotta's middle name is 
		emilie and when i awoke i had to confront myself with
		a sort of weighing the matter...i ate most of an orange
		with sugar right away...do i say to me that miss grant
		is calling me or that snowbound lotta's name creates
		this irony...most ironic was pig, as the vice president
		of the nick cage south american fan club, although
		i should be promoted, the film is extremely informative
		if one cares to pay attention...i wasn't in the right
		mind set...the swine's face reminded me of alexandra
		and she is interested in acting but it was the only time
		i felt that except when i used to hang out with a 
		sibling of some narcotic agent...to think of it now he
		died in a car crash and she had a close call driving
		recently...i write it extemporanously and with the hope
		that it voids future incidents when she is at the wheel...
		so portland is three hundred years overdue for the thing
		i will not mention...whoa, nell has not posted in a year,
		i do hope no one has put placed a pony up daddy saddle
		on her...nicole mentioned woman under the influence and
		although i myself dislike boxd-letter, i went to see it.
		the line "i'm not a spaghetti man" sticks with me somehow.
		i couldnt get the right voice and speed to enjoy hangsaman as
		an audio book so i eyeballed it which is much faster yet
		actually slower given my inclination to postpone or procrastinate
		not to mention the natural distractions that occur when it is
		not an actual paperback or hardcover...or it could be that i
		yet feel the white goddess was not entirely learnt...no, not
		as intense as finnegan's wake yet i want to gain as many
		details as i might...still, life keeps moving like a wildfire
		consuming the spaces with red hot burning replacements...
		so as to even make social media scrolling logical to some
		extent...i found it highly interesting that jean-marie passed
		away on the day i failed to secure the agspalding pen i 
		wanted when the topic came up as i forgot my own notion
		of waiting to get it later on...i did get a waterman which
		was on sale...i believe they are french, no less...i believe
		i like mr magoo but i have no clue how he came up in conversation
		with mother...she liked the clip but i was told she did not
		have patience for the film...i thought it was wonderful...
		1001 arabian nights - actually an ancestor; abdul aziz magoo
		sells lamps and his lazy nephew is aladdin...i mean come on
		there are even three little maids from damascus...
		to circle back to the thin white duke, aladdin sane not
		only had the jean genie but also panic in detroit...the
		lions have me expecting them to go all the way after the
		pounding they gave minnesota last sunday...i am trying to
		keep calm...anyway i picked out the format for deep elem
		and plucked through a few ideas but i don't seem to be in 
		a hurry about it. i suppose you could see that as confidence
		or an addiction to hesitation. happy birthday, everyone.
		nobody should feel so crowded with things to do...i run
		through the ideas (shave, clean kitchen, make a meal,
		receive the incoming delivery...groceries, take a bath,
		give up on the idea of fender and esp guitars, well, 
		perhaps not some vintage models, scale ritual, start
		the recording process for that blues song i want to
		cover, update film list, take care of skirt, call mother, and avoid 
		the news while hoping los angeles makes it through
		what can only be called a walking inferno) of course
		instead i avidly search the news and then take a nap...
		pre dream i felt no stability as if a face dance...
		at least they were faces i liked...it's too bad no
		beautiful girl ever feels as pretty as they look - 
		mostly they think it is make up or that their lips
		are too thin or something...suddenly i am excited
		to be asleep...i was fully expecting to see lotta's
		mother as she had been on my mind upon waking but i
		was actually in some european town...like portugal
		i imagine or some hybrid place further north...
		there is a girl that approaches me, somehow she
		knows i am thinking of lotta, oh she's cheating on
		you, i don't say anything and continue sauntering
		until i see her at a dead end street leaning against 
		a silvery grey wall with some guy i do not know and
		i near ironically looking at him not her and i say
	        not what i am thinking meaning he is wearing feathery
		earrings going in fact for a compliment and then walking
		away without speaking to her reaching the corner there
		is an alleyway the type one finds in chinatown places
		where a woman in the type of hat which would be more
		akin to the 1930s or 1940s although less so floats
		into the walkway upon which  point i decide to follow
		the anachronism and also to run yet halfway into my getaway
		lotta is holding on to me and then drags me into some type
		of mall that i can only describe as modern wherein she
		seems intent on proving herself to me...she keeps repeating
		that she wants to be there because they are giving away
		something or other - the last word i saw her use was lustig
		- it had that sound but it was another word - i do not ask
		what she means possibly still annoyed at her being with the
		bloke with the earrings - i notice an extended family and
		a baby - i ask to experience the scene with me which she does
		and it does not feel weird to sort of snuggle inbetween these
		fat women looking down at the child - there are to older children
		next to me and i ask about the kid's name, his name is neptune
		you should say hi to him with his name, i step over to where
		lotta is and see that in the meanwhile they have given her coffee
		and i go along with the hello instructions and the baby waves
		as if he really likes his name and then lotta leads me to 
		a cafe but its one without seats so we go horizantal into
		one of the booths laying down me first then her in front of
		the waitress who immediately settles down a very fine and crisp
		looking salad so i suppose the word meant salad - salat, feldsalat,
		not certain yet i take a close look at the waitress as i write
		this now i want to say julia stiles yet the character was more
		like ginnifer goodwin - in contrast to the guy i actually can't
		memorize her face as i notice her undoing the lace of her collar
		well choker i think they call them above a very sheer uniform
		blouse that was sorely in need of a bra as the sight of nipples
		and petite breasts once again made me realize that indeed for 
		men titties are like the sun then awaking feeling nearer 
		than ever to lotta yet not exactly sure what the dream meant 
		or if the lettuce was any good - i thought later perhaps it 
		meant that she has the notion that those are the type men like
		or something...although i don't think she is insecure and so i 
		won't augment the thought with adding words about her cuteness
		besides what if there is or was an affair...or even the 
		manipulation of emotion to provoke my jealousy after i put 
		placed westsofia77's project on the home page...who knows,
		i do know it is next to impossible to balance the likes and
		loves...usually i dive deep into the situation and neglect
		everything else save for coffee and cigarettes, yet now
		i am reluctant to give in to expectations or jump to conclusions,
		much less make demands or disregard all the whatever it is i 
		need to get done and so it goes.
		<br>
		january 9<br>
		<br>
		correction like the sun...for myself it would be like the rain.
		on second thought the waitress might have been india...
		that would make sense...i felt a sort of magic or synchronicity
		in the list as i placed shanghai express after phantom as it
		was the film playing in the fictional movie house...i had an
		entirely different idea for what would follow yet i could not
		find it and obviously this way even makes more sense - i also
		viewed that film again - noticing the peiping sign and the 
		watch, a flintridge...it has a flip cover which one can still
		get yet it has become an uncommon style...anyway it isn't a
		movie about writers yet there are several written messages
		which qualifies it for the list...after having only soup and
		bread, the big meal made me sluggish...so much so that leaning
		into the twenty scale ritual i was surprised - pleasantly, 
		at my own enthusiasm which i suppose was enhanced by now
		feeling i got them down...i found out leighton was one of
		the victims of the wildfires, well her house, but the 
		knowledge came along with finding out she was married and
		has a couple of children...so in rifling through memory
		the emotions were varied as if they wanted to contradict
		themselves...what i think now or wonder is if she still
		writes music...there was not much music in my mind save
		for a zorn tune...zip, why is it zip code...hmm...gotta
		look that up...questions i never asked...quickly i 
		embraced the idea of lotta in pre-dream as i pondered
		over dean and schecter guitars...you gotta see the
		eastwood guitars tiktok...extremely entertaining if
		you like me like simply looking at guitars...the guy
		from bizarre reno is also cool although he seems a 
		bit too enchanted by old fenders and gibsons...
		seen the maestro series...but everyone says they are
		not worth it...now then dreams...two men stood by
		a truck, one peeing into mid-air as if trying to 
		wet a woman standing across from him...this again
		was a scene in which i felt i was a viewer instead
		of a participant to some extent - as the truck pulls
		away, i see that lilia is in the back, i call to her
		to get out of the truck as it speeds away...i kept
		dreaming easier locations and sensations mostly
		with lotta who got some of the snow cleared...
		anyway none of these moments, perhaps for being so
		casual kept themselves in the waking mind...i did
		think how hard it must be for her to work through
		the fine line of being herself while fencing off
		the once in a while weird multitudes wanting her
		to be something else...i suppose models and actresses
		might relate to being in that positions - as i awoke,
		the scene had me facing a very powerful woman, i 
		thought it might be an actress but that may only have
		been due to the fact that i love cinema so...anyway
		entirely different from my jean harlow silk dream,
		here the woman was adamant - there's nobody like me
		that will make you feel so fine, or was it good...
		and there i was under a spell of sorts even bowing
		down the way one does when knighted by royalty...
		except my penis was gushing pee through the erection
		as if the entire evening was scripted or someone
		was trying to make me wet the bed...yet aside from
		the number one, i felt there was some truth in it
		that was told therein...i don't know who she might
		be however...i know that i mentioned some pre-dream
		similar to all this and perhaps someone reading it
		was making it out to be what i never intended...i 
		mean yes i did "see" that but i remember carlos
		cracked up on cocaine as we stood at west end 
		urinals suddenly turning to me and peeing on the
		lower part of my right leg...so i don;t think any
		one wants to be peed on and i certainly don't
		want to pee on nobody...the pre dawn air is cool
		i can hear jim singing 'passion lady give up your
		vows...save our city ah right now'...i'm not having
		an ale but i am already high on love...very much
		so...meaning i adore me and i like exploring that
		self adoration with lotta even in times when i 
		cannot recall what the dream said.

	      9 january<br>
	</br>
		i somehow stumble dream into a department store yet i cannot find
		the right exit, wandering around a woman with thick legs
		grabs me as if a friend then we dance - i can feel her 
		press against me as if teasing the penis resting at her
		thigh - she seems to know that i am trying to get somewhere,
		to get home and we walk out of the place into an avenue
		of darkness, she is walking ahead of me, heading to her car
		and i am asking if she is really going to give me a ride
		when unlocking the door with a guffaw she slides into
		the vehicle leaving me without a clue as to where i am or
		how to get home - i remember asking someone at the shop
		which is the exit that leads to bella vista...a scene
		later said some sort of argument with a man insisting on
		something or other yet somehow wound up with a ruined
		right foot, his valet stopping their ride in its track
		as he howled in pain, getting out and flicking away
		the two remaining toes onto the road carelessly...i
		wake up wondering how i can see this or why i am
		interacting with people that don't like me and i 
		surely don't like...i get up and adjust the los angeles
		lament a bit, thinking i wrote it too hurriedly and it
		could be improved somehow even if i know the main point
		must hit the emotional place no one wants to speak of
		like a bolt of lightning...i hope its quiet today
		as the intrusive talk disrupted my inclination to 
		record...i suppose wearing headphones to get through
		my own kitchen experience would do it otherwise -
		maybe these dreams bordering on nightmare reflect
		how rattled those loudspeakers and locals, as if timed
		to detonate a word or two into the air as i stand
		by the fridge, make me feel. you see i want to think
		of the song not them...in the worst case scenario, 
		a muse or even myself in order to flesh out something
		beyond this time and this place. ps, pre dream very
		clear thought of ive fang this from memory handing
		each other notes while i learned some chinese...
		let us call it nostalgia - no sense in next dream
		strolling what can only be washington heights -
		a man is trying to tell me about some politician
		that admires the police - i don't stop but glance
		at the nightmare image of three men dressed up
		like halloween cops - i can't help but voice the
		fact of their corruption...dominicans! finding
		a train station i am as if in a sequel to previous
		dream trying to get home except now to manhattan -
		i get on a train slowly with some guy that keeps
		talking - get in, get in, he says - it is not like
		the mta, in fact like a rollercoaster with an iron
		belt strap holding the passengers in place - 
		there are two other guys in the front seat and
		and a blurry figure directly behind so three rows
		and this contraption is going to brooklyn and i am
		asking what the stop is, brubaker? can i then transfer
		back to a wagon to the city...the answer is vague,
		the guys are in argument. i have no idea who they 
		are and awake baffled especially since like the 
		buses in rome one simply gets on without the process
		of payment, if i recall it was sort of an honor system
		in italy...but to someone from new york that means
		a free ride...weird to think of that now. 
		<br>
		11 january<br>
		<br>
		well in reality not so weird, if i was thinking of
		home, it would make sense as i felt at home in rome.
		my dreams exploded into psychodelic vision the type
		one might experience only with drugs or during a
		fight except being hit in the eye is not as colorful
		where the expression seeing stars originates...
		after that all the scenes were easier yet nothing
		i suppose remarkable enough to linger into waking -
		i guess i was too excited over finally recording
		deep elem blues...i did an electric version which
		i still liked after listening to it a few times -
		even if i feel the chorus vocal needs to be doubled
		and the fact that it went over five minutes...i 
		did that on an empty stomach and then after a light
		meal i recorded a different version of the same 
		song using the acoustic but this take was haunted
		by someone mentioning a now political singer-songwriter,
		strange how that happens - so i struggled even with 
		the words as if distracted although i've been studying
		them and even wrote them down...anyway no excuses, that
		second take was still good but far from great except
		for the way i turned the chord changes...making it a
		seventh e then a bent e on the fourth fret resolving 
		into the regular e major on the verses...the vocal was
		awful in failing to be mindful of the words and again
		over five minutes...i decided to give the shelton brothers
		version another listen since i based it on them...ah,
		no break between the verse and chorus gets you a three
		minute song...still, for only having done the scale ritual
		in recent weeks or even months, i felt pretty pleased at
		the results...i could nearly understand why the beatles
		recorded dozens of takes...not that i am going in that
		direction...yet all this is tempered by the knowledge
		of the massive destruction in california...the press
		reports the death of sam from sam & dave...i listen
		to hold on i'm coming, a tune impossible to dislike -
		but then the thing that makes most sense to hear at
		a time like this is the alabama five woke up this
		morning soprano theme song...i hear a few more songs
		that are "suggested" on yt...put placing this pen 
		into actions evident here...it is yet very early in
		the day and hopefully i will get at least a third
		take of the cover i'm working on...

              <b>deep elem blues live electric- two skinny girls...<br>	

	<br>
		      14 january<br>
		      <br>

	when i got around to mixing the deep elem tracks i realized
	why it sometimes takes me a while to play around with the daw -
	or even why at other times i rush through the process of song
	production...it's like an added step which requires an entirely
	different talent and disposition...neither of which are easy 
	for me - like editing a book after the writing is done...
	since there are several live takes, which leaves nothing much in
	terms of mastering - given that it is all on one track, this
	conundrum was eased - although i did not expect to do it all
	in two days...much less to get a couple of tracks i really 
	like...the only thing i didn't do was record videos for these,
	instead opting to put place scenes from the white hell of 
	pitz palu on each song...always thought leni was a director
	but you can see her acting in that...	   
	i simply felt a bit too disheveled and further could not 
	decide on a location...although i do have a room that 
	could be nice for filming...anyway presenting it this
	way feels cooler, even quirky...my only real trouble 
	came using the open e tuning for one take which took me
	about twelve attempts to find a groove that would mesh
	with the vocal i had in mind...i did not have it in mind
	to put place them here, however, when i went to upload
	from laptop to phone, the cord did not respond except 
	to see itself as charging which led me to upload them
	thisaway for access at video editing - well, enough 
	notes on deep elem - i am a bit further into hangsaman
	and have watched this is the night -bj, "before javeline"
	and learned a bit about thelma todd - i also viewed the
	wisdom of crocodiles - sometimes called immortality and
	was pretty impressed, especially by timothy's performance -
	even if the antagonist thugs were overplayed...
	otherwise not much to report in terms of dreams - 
	i'm certain of dreaming of lotta last night yet in
	such a casual way that there is only a glimpse memory
	remaining - yesterday dreaming of walking into a 
	magazine shop on the upper west side - for some reason
	handing the man there my backpack - i was thinking i 
	had four dollars yet i am not sure what i wanted to buy -
	i awoke wondering if it was about the brim screenplay
	or the two dollar bill i had used there once upon a time -
	afternoon ordering water, i was actually sent extra money and
	phoned back to return it - a few minutes later i decided
	to review my other phone and found a letter from mike -
	it had been a while and brought up some recollections i
	had not entertained or considered previously - specifically
	about another timothy...oh my rock star friends...it was
	mr wright that gave me a lesson about rasputin by way of
	maria's book. meanwhile a lot of talk about tiktok, there
	is one protest clip displaying the united states blowing
	itself up...so china can't have it...i feel awful for the
	american creators living under a system that does not respect
	their freedom in that sense...how nice is it to earn a decent
	wage doing something you actually enjoy, i saw one girl was
	even able to purchase a house...to speak of this naturally
	leads to politics, i know the kremlin took similar actions
	even if i feel this now proves my point about there being
	more freedom in moscow than washington - especially in the
	sense that what they want is to own that platform...now
	the viral jealousy sound seems eerily prophetic, if i can't
	have you; no one can...so the stolen election that started
	with wuhan kiev ends with bytedancing wildfires. ps, 
	yes justine it was disaster tourism when they alerted the
	press for photo-ops, drove an hour and a half to spend
	a whopping fifteen minutes showing their hats...i felt
	physically upset until paris stood up for displaced cats
	and even adopted a dog, like burroughs said you can't fake
	quality like you can't fake a good meal. 

		      <br>
		      15 january<br>
		      <br>
	i feel like the spirit of wsb summoned queer and i am
	terribly excited to see how the film fleshed out the 
	novel...i re-read that opening chapter a few weeks ago
	when i made one of the writing processors you can find
	here in this domain, there are others at inkrealm.info
	- because when i first read it what stayed was me was
	the note he made a prefix in which he detailed his
	feelings about joan vollmer...possession, to many is
	not a viable truth yet like in the shirley jackson story,
	where i easily related it as factual, i see now that
	i missed that point or rather did not connect my 
	experiences with that word - indeed, possession is 
	not only a viable truth, i tell you i have seen it
        happen. i do not mean in the catholic exorcism way,
	although others have seen that...yet none of this is
	what i actually wanted to jot but i suppose my thrill
	at getting to see this movie overtakes me...i wanted
	to take another dig at the publicity seeking former
	royals who somehow keep using and are still named
	as if HRH when they are not. hell the queen may her
	soul rest in peace even revoked their cottage she
	was so upset...perhaps south east england is now
	montecito...the duke and duchess of montecito, i mean
	if the press is going to keep playing along why not go
	all the way - this rant is tempered by the fact that
	i noticed the media kicking the not so dynamic duo
	of biden harris and i don't want to come off as a bully -
	or appear to partake in persecution even if justified. 
	so i won't "say" more at this juncture - now then, this
	brings to mind how crushed paris was while thinking 
	she could never be a princess...yet now, clearly,
	if anyone can claim the title of american royalty -
	it is her...in a quiet and effective manner she managed
	to raise eight hundred thousand dollars and counting
	in mere minutes...of course, this might be due to the
	fact of her malibu home on top of her rv trailer incident,
	but i can;t see any selfishness in her fundraising and
	much less in her caring for pets all the while being a
	loving mother although ms hilton i do think you are going
	to spoil them kids...ahem. yes i am done kissing ass,
	i viewed spread, more for the list and keitel than anything-
	it had this very strange butt licking thing, a mediocre
	movie with a few good lines...i know iknow comedy is hard...
	somehow the last two days the scales became hard...well two
	of twenty...a couple of them somehow got jumbled in my head
	where surely the melodic was being called the minor in the
	bebop notes and as i noticed it it took some of the edge off
	my confidence, luckily i am pretty sure i won't have to speak
	about scales to anyone...i saw that ozzy is now in the hall of
	fame and did a bit of celebration via reposting but with
	the concern that  rhoads got the guitar award '81 only
	months before his passing '82 and this thing was '24 and
	hopefully he will not be in danger in '25 if you see my 
	logic although i suppose we are all in danger and him 
	moreso regardless of awards...like the pope, it's a focus
	point that people fixate on or as dylan put placed it,
	people can kill you with kindness...fame leaves few
	hiding places, hmm bowie put it concisely; what you need
	you have to borrow...i can't borrow the guitars i want
	but last night that was what i was dreaming of, electric
	instruments...still only a glimpse-memory as i awoke 
	tormented by a nagging pain for the second day in a row -
	the time before it felt like my calf was being twisted -
	lower back as if all those tumblr ads had gone to work
	on a subconscious level, too bizarre well like possession...
	to come full circle in the note - it's as if someone is
	trying to go to sleep within me thus awaking me painfully -
	who knows - uhm i felt fine as i pondered the matter and
	fed the cat, so fine i went back to sleep and dreamt i 
	owned some sort of cafe bar with suze, the place had two
	rooms, it was not crowded and i asked her to take my
	things...wallet, watch, hmm, there were two wallets...
	well she took these things into the other room, a sort
	of private office slash vip area...i was taking care of
	the front when this rude woman tried to rush past me
	to gain access to where she was...i lifted a small white
	statue to her face and ended the invasion then i went
	in for some reason asking her for my wallet, she handed
	me the zara but i said i wanted the valentino and then
	we seemed to trade places as i stayed in that room and
	she made her way to the front - the doors were swinging
	types and before she could exit she was confronted by
	several men, surrounded, attacked - i ran and tried to
	pry the one behind her off her by the mouth but then 
	thought the eyes and started clawing into one of his 
	eyes with my right hand while pulling him away with my
	left hand...all pretty intense and i awoke hoping no
	woman i knew would be wounded in this way and that
	i would not know the feeling of pushing a man's eye
	away from the socket...for a minute it all felt like
	an alternate reality...as if married and running a
	mom and pop shop...she loved that guthrie kid tale
	about how people get hitched, i can't recall it but
	it was something about the man simply putting a 
	a ring on the woman's finger...i never called nobody
	as much as i phoned her over the hills and far away...
	william shot joan, a peeper sized hole in the forehead, 
	i believe his story but it troubles me that her child who was there
	is hardly ever mentioned - either to protect her,
	or more likely to not complicate matters further
	in the face of tragedy...this is one aspect i 
	am intent on seeing addressed in the film.

	<br>

		      16 january<br>
		      <br>

		i have always loved the word juxtaposition...it felt
		foreign and i could never imagine it in the mouth of
		some old-timer...much less a foreigner. 
		thursday. so it was wednesday when i watched queer.
		i was enjoying the opening, not so much the font, 
		until i heard sinead oconner singing all apologies -
		that is a nirvana tune, naturally i started thinking
		of william meeting kurt and how sad it was for music
		that her voice although immortal will not make new
		songs...these thoughts along with a slight concern
	        over a grocery delivery which i expected to arrive
		between eight and eleven - it came about ten thirty -
		or as the film left the caverns of ecuador - went 
	        through me along with a suspicion that the soundtrack
		would be too distracting...don't get me wrong, the
		songs were mostly good except the sort of hyped up
		ending 'how can..' thing which has burroughs' name 
		stapled on it without his exact consent - contrary
		to what may seem a negative review allow me to preface
		these scribbles by saying i have rarely wanted to enjoy
		a film as much as i did this one - given that i admire
		wsb's writing greatly...and this is a great film with
		unexpected and wonderful acting by the lead, mr craig.
		yet before we are allowed to vibe at his electricity,
		there is 'come as you are' like a music video complete
		with rooster fighting sounds as the protagonist catches
		sight of what turns out to be both a supporting player 
		and the antagonist unless you consider drug use in that
		category instead - but i didn't want to judge this like
		that in fact the fact that it made me think of things
		external to daniel or william should have told me what
		i am about to divulge; well implore, please remake this
		with a proper soundtrack! not only does it step on the
		actor's toes but it tramples over el hombre invisible -
		watch it and see how the next song - some low rumble 
		jazz leaves you wondering about the meaning of "segue" in 
		the next scene which they used for the trailer...transition
		might be more apt - re; segue...
		before all this - i should have mentioned the starting
		credits serve as a catalyst to the confusion i have 
		underlined...lowery's under the volcano next to rimbaud's
		a season in hell...might even make some viewers pause
		to read both books before proceeding...camel cigarettes
		are all over the place - in those opening credits they
		lay next to raleigh cigarettes...although he gave up
		smoking, in the 1990s he was fond of kamel menthols
		which i guess is where they came up with camels...
		burroughs smoked old gold, lucky strikes, benson&hedges,
		      english ovals, and senior service...of course 
		marijuana but that is not to the point...
	        more to the point are the guns, a clip line of ten
		handguns curls into seven; mauser, derringer, star model b or beretta, 
		      a colt, amadeo rossi, norinco, harrington or foehl & weeks,
		the fire arm of the famed incident was the star .380 automatic
		but the tragedy itself is not only overlooked but disguised
		as if he had shot the supporting player/antagonist well at least
		in a lynchian lifted type dream sequence time lapse which winds up
		making us look at the man in the aforementioned 90s without
		the novelty camel smokes - a bit before - to not lose the
		lack of logic in the soundtrack - a french or italian pop
		song sprinkles itself mysteriously as daniel/william falls
		to earth from the sky and saunters back to chips ahoy...
		the absence of mexico in all this is a spectacular form
		of writing, we never feel mexico city and much less quito -
		quitting for a minute to grab the goods from the door and
		put things here and there i thought well my soup was pretty
		good and daniel is shockingly good even if too fat to play
		bill - well, not fat - stocky - yes too strong physically
		even during withdrawal we already sense he will pull through-
		i watched the ending positively hating the final song but
		said to myself take a another look and listen tomorrow,
		sleep on it...and so i did, it only got worse. i awoke 
		and went through guitar scales...a string popped and 
		i found there two very troubled screws living in the 
		ibanez roadstar ii - rusty and refusing any sort of twist
		or turn...i had to put place most of the strings back 
		again carefully and i nearly cried after - i suppose
		the sense of tears was also weeping over this great
		and interesting film which in fact even hinted at the
		irony of joan's child by way of a kid at the bottom
		of the stairs and yes i did catch the william tell
		sofa playing in the party overdose trip...crying
		because the soundtrack sucked harder than the
		homosexual scenes - wilder than i expected but also
		lessened by this intrusive soundtrack, like i said,
		a lot of good songs but in the wrong place, dr john
		might have shaped some if best with 'right place wrong
		time' - i am well aware of the amount of work and love
		that goes into something like this and of how careless
		this note might come off as, but why should i lie about
		how i feel except to myself and in fantasy where i
		could convince myself that jean harlow is embracing me - 
		indeed, i expect anyone actually reading this demands
		my truth in a sense and so it goes...off the top of my
		head i think an entire bowie soundtrack would have
		worked if the point was to please the mtv and social
		media scroll crowds along with having it be someone he
		had some interaction with...when time magazine tells
		you why it is a grand statement with explanations then
		you know something is wrong and for me it was the tunes. 
		how i wish this was not the case. now then to further
		juxtapose; hollywoodland by two skinny girls should
		be released any minute now, well re-released...
		      which i will now dedicate to someone with
		      several perfect soundtracks, david lynch,
		      not to mention a goodly record of his own.
		      they are saying he is dead but they are
		      wrong, lynch is not dead because lynch is
		      immortal!
		      <br>
		      <br>
		hollywoodland<br>

		      18 january
		      <br>
		      it made sense, to me, to watch hoodlum empire
		on the heels of kraven the hunter and i sort of got
		a kick out of both...still, friday was an awful
		day which did not improve until i put it to bed -
		lotta had said she hated sitting around the apartment
		all the time and that is coherent yet it is also
		the opposite of how i feel...very much enjoying
		the confines of my place which even make me wonder
		how anyone can manage to live in much larger spaces
		as i often find myself wishing there were less rooms
		that being in terms of cleaning - in terms of dreams
		i had one vague scene in aunt's house...i remember
		it sort of turned or transformed into a shop but 
		the details escape - kind of like being in the
		inconsistent thoughts of the girl from hangsaman...
		a bit of inconsistancy with the guitar scales -
		i suppose it is due to being stubborn - as once
		i believe it learnt i don't check to see if i am
		right...how can an egomaniac be wrong...well as
		it happened with one suspended scale which i didn't
		catch until weeks later, i made it a point to get
		these errors corrected and i am pretty confident that
		i won't mix up the enigmatic with the byzantine
		unless i start calling it arabic again...the new
		ones, voodoo and bali, also get a bit mixed up in
		my mind but repetition of their patterns is now
		catching up to automatic memory...in fact, i felt
		so good about it, i started learning another bebop
		scale in order to know the complete versions...
		in dreams, i saw guitars, one was very nice yet
		i could not find it as i walked between rooms 
		encountering a dusty left handed strat which i
		am actually curious to attempt if only to see
		how it feels to have the knobs nearer to the wrist -
		in the dream there was a bizarre typewriter with
		cash register keys in the middle which was atop
		a blue metal case ibm hard drive seemingly - i;ve
		not seen anything like it as it is not like any
		existing model although a bit like the ancient 
		manual typewriters in terms of size - i should
		report that i was able to - with kitchen knife
		      and tweezers - to untangle the remaining
		stuck screw from the ibanez which gives me a 
		bit more freedom in terms of the pluck or strum
		which i have on purpose kept from being too intense
		so as not have to purchase new strings - exhausted
		from this process i left the old strings on there -
		it does not sound great, the mismatched ernie balls
		but it's good enough to run through the twenty scale
		ritual - now in mentioning these things i do not mean
		to imply mastery of my instrument in fact more correctly
		lack of expertise...even if i do not feel that way when
		playing something familiar or improvising upon it. my
                favorite new song is an archaic thing called 'i've
		got a feeling i'm falling' - annette hanshaw...1929,
		or thereabouts...it thrills me.
		      <br>
		      <br>
		      19 january<br>
		      <br>
		      "did you ever have a dream that you couldn;t
		explain...ever met your accusers face to face in the rain..."
		i used to think of that song alot - not to learn chords
		or words, but it stuck around my mind after i learnt
		the words...i bring it up as a point of irony - as i
		never tried to play it or even play along to it...
		maybe it was the references to milton and dante at
		the start...i don't recall the start of this dream,
		i found myself in a shop as if part of a group that
		was looting the place...i remember scattered pens
		adorning the floor near the counter by the exit -
		i might hve been thinking how strange it was that
		shirley jackson used the ellipses alot in hangsaman...
		it sort of made me feel justified in terms of myself
		employing them...but enough to join marauders and trash
		a place in a dream? hmm...perhaps...outside it was still
		light but the grey light that is nowhere near bright -
		i had a delay getting a german film entitled 'hotel', which
		i am viewing now, and watched 'the trust' which exceeds
		irony on several levels...we are getting into a car -
		a silver only slightly brighter than the asphalt, a station
		wagon but one of the guys begins to argue with me - not
		certain what it was about - he pulls out a knife and starts
		to do that sort of dance knife wielders do who have no 
		training in martial arts - i do not think of defending
		myself except to say something about the logic of simply
		getting away and leaving the violent discussion for later -
		in memory i turn away and into the vehicle as he charges
		then shift away from his reckless plunge leading him into
		the car and then getting in myself but that might be a 
		fictional version of the dream as i am pretty certain i
		awoke before turning...awaking, i look at the time, i 
		make coffee, i let a few cigarettes smoke, i think of
	        lotta and update domains, then weaving through headlines
		i find "man stabbed to death, teen wounded on lower east
		side outside movie theater' -there are, it seems, ten
		films playing in that house; the goonies, one of them
		days, wolf man, den of thieves, the last show girl,
		a complete unknown, babygirl, nosferatu, mufasa, the
		brutalist, nickel boys, september 5, anora, and 
		wicked...a couple of tickets cost about thirty dollars.
		(there is no charge to get punctured by knife
		or to hold it in a deadly grip even if amazon
		will not deliver blades to the new york area)
		i'd only watch the kidman film and the anderson movie. 
		i'd been thinking that the literal translation of the
		others in german is die anderen although they say
		it was called unknown, unbekannt...sorry tiktok isnt
		available right now...close app! one nation under a 
		groove, but since most folks don't go to church on
		sunday no more i hear service is being restored...
		i returned to sleep actually dreaming of myself in
		a surprised mirror as if searching for my face by
		lifting and pulling my hair back...sometimes one
		even forgets that beauty comes from within...lotta
		made pasta. i played the scale ritual and plan to 
		give it another go before going back to the deep
		woods of the austrian alps in 'hotel'...ps, Detroit's
	        nearly perfect season came to an end when a wide
		receiver threw a pass to a running back under double
		coverage as they trailed by ten in the fourth quarter.
		there is nothing to say except thanks anyway and
		hope somehow those fans that paid two thousand for
		a seat ticket get a refund. man woman or teen i
		really thought they could take it this year. well,
		now one is left to cheer only for a chief's defeat.
		 <br>
		      <br>
		      20 jan<br>
		      <br>
		      to conclude the string point; if memory serves
		the nearest place to get them here ran about double
		the cost, that was about seven hundred pesos...but i
		am speaking of years ago...as i
		search now i see regular slinky's advertised for over
		fifteen hundred pesos - uhm well over twenty dollars...
		so you understand it's not the five dollars we are 
		used to paying...there might be less expensive options
		but even so in taking a cab it would not add up to be
		careless in that sense...
		and yes i could get b and high e string by themselves
		but usually not the same brand and i imagine the sound
		quality would suffer...lastly, i have purchased no
		acoustic strings in a while going for the electric
		variety on the martin...i really liked the ring of
		fender bullets but i only found those onetime...my
		choice is dean markley bronze which i have never seen
		here...in case anyone wondered -
		after a long and convoluted conversation with mother
		and sister i got curious over a certain porn but when i skipped
		through it i thought it more horrific than anything
		and not only did it derail my goal of research but
		also it felt like i was witnessing a murder - even
		if it has become commonplace with onlyfans and such -
		i can't see that girl being taken seriously, it was
		as if she was turned into a triviality, a ghost
		that would itself be haunted. later i thought too, 
		the man involved -who showed his face- has limited
	        himself in unimaginable ways...obviously politics
		would be out of the question et cetera, a type of
		social suicide and for what? there is not that much
		money in that business...well, there is some but
		that type of content has become so readily available
		that mostly it is done in part to maintain the patriarchy
		and in part to have incel parties or something like that...
		anyway this demostrates the appointment in samarra story
		irony as in trying to escape my careless talk i only
		found a greater annoyance...somehow i did duck out
		from both bizarre ponds and got to sleep although much
		later than i wanted or expected...therein i thought not
		of strings or conversations or horrid vulgarity...in fact
		i was in my room a lot more colorful than i recall -
		i seemed to be joking with myself about going to a 
		school as a teacher or as a student and so picking out
		the outfit when suddenly i wanted to cut class, yes no
		backpack to take lessons and no tweed blazer to give
		a lecture yet i feeling so confident over this unusual
		ability of being either or...the phone rang, faculty
		insisting that i not be late for my class, hmm so it
		was a lecture day and so i would not be free unless,
                i thought, i gave up both roles and kept this recurring
		dream as a personal treasure for memory as it was now
		for some reason revealing itself to me so much so the
		self-jape felt entertaining - some people did not
		find 'hotel' entertaining but right at the end i knew
		it as if i had written it - i understood the mystery
		as if by instinct, as if there could be no other way 
		to write that ending. i've only felt that way once 
		before while viewing an atom egoyan movie and that
		was nearly dejavu in some sense except i had not seen
		it before...to think there will only be a very limited
		amount of new david lynch projects is truly sad, sadder
		than cheap ass porn. william s burroughs wrote something
		about this pen occupation like simply doing his homework.
		i think it was in a book entitled the job. perhaps, that
		was the catalyst of those learning dream scenes...ps,
		i wanted to underline something about guitar scales,
		i mostly do them as a way of honoring jerry garcia...
		by mentioning them i do not mean to recommend the
		ritual since everyone has their own method...chords,
		knowing chords should be sufficient knowledge to 
		work out notes for leads and i found this to be very true and
		to some extent easier...i know a lot of guitarists
		simplify the scales by only using a box shape and
		i mention this hoping to clarify my position...sometimes
		i will admit that the extra knowledge helps yet all
		one has to do is review how many players breathed
		genius without knowing how to read music and often
		enough without any idea of scales or as i often 
		put placed it; there are only essentially seven notes.

		i didn't imagine it like soft porn, yet that is
		what the rom com 'lick' was...yet nearly good...
		but to add a note upon yesterday's thought, in
		trying to avoid the hoopla over inauguration,
		hoping they get down to business, i came across
		a clip of bo diddly playing bo diddly...
		now neither you nor i could count the songs
		that draw from that rhythm...i bring it up since it
		demonstrates perfectly the idea of only needing chords-
		so let us say it is in the key of E or C sharp minor,
		some say it is in G and maybe buddy holly played
		it in A with a jazzier turn...makes no difference 
		as the one prevailing chord rings through it and 
		the solo is merely sliding that self same chord up 
		      an octave...somehow it all works in fact 
		      wonderfully which is why so many other
		songs take up that groove...
		      so if anyone tries to convince you that
		you need this or that well basically you don't as
		the one chord song proves itself and it is not
		alone in that category...
		i got halfway through hangsaman and went to sleep
		early wherein i dreamt of riding on a train as if
		going from one compartment to another, there was
		a kitten in a waste basket as i passed through
		then two cats that looked worried so i picked them
		up to get them on their way noticing some much
		larger animal threatening them, i want to say it
		was an elephant yet it could have been a rhino -
		something grey at which point i awoke concerned
		since lotta would be traveling...i wondered if
		she was taking a train to her destination and
		nervously smoked through a couple of cups of coffee
		until seeing she was flying...i suppose amsterdam
		or copenhagen...since those flights match the 
		timeline although there were a couple to other
		parts of sweden but i doubt anything is going
		down in those places...before the settling knowledge
		i managed to nap but in such an odd manner that
		no logic manifested...i mean i was listening to
		someone i used to know speak, he kept talking
		as if in a race - when he started telling me
		about his son being better at drawing than at
		learning languages well i had to stop him, responding
		that it was not wise to speak so much...irl,
		he had a daughter...but rising i thought it might
		be about my first neighbors here, who were actually
		much nicer than those that remained, it was the
		same first name...yet in a split second i decided
		that it could be about the 'soho' residences across
		the street...one of which is guarded by a company
		strangely called cvs...cv being the person's initials,
		adding an s well if you have been in the states you
		most likely have come across that pharmacy chain...
		the last time i was there, buying camel blue hundreds,
		i picked up an electrical adaptor that still funtions.
		no matter, i followed through on my scale ritual and
		looked at 'advanced' chord shapes beyond the common
		ones i had not thought of much...there are about forty 
		and while i don't see myself employing a major seventh
		sharp 5 and sharp nine it might happen or help in other
		ways...the rest i know...i'm thinking in terms of jazz
		but it occurs to me that none of the jazz players i 
		heard speak ever talked chords at all...indeed, drugs
		mostly and onetime food...django reinhardt likely
		had more food than drugs but it gives me pause
		when i a see let us say the g major with an added 6th
		and ninth in his chord changes knowing the man had
		only had his thumb to balance two working fingers...

		      22 january
		      <br>
		      the other day, i awoke feeling that my skin was
		dry yet when i went to bathe it felt fine...i suspected
		that incident started what i hope is no series of dreams...
		well, it is not exactly in the category of dreams, more
		like a stop watch alerting loudly...'wake the fuck up'
		i heard stumbling out of scenes and even felt a hand
		pulling at my right shoulder - a few days ago which i
		never noted since it was neither thought nor dream or
		so it seemed...yesterday as i thought about lotta, 
		who actually went to berlin not the places i imagined,
		i dreamt i was making a telephone call in my room -
		yet i could sense and see a man listening in on
		the other side as in a wiretap...opening the door
		a scantily dressed or perhaps even naked man pranced
		about the hallway - for a second i considered the
		ghost of father yet more likely an impersonator...
		then a woman's voice saying loudly, 'where is my beau'
		of course i could net tell if she meant bow, or bo,
		or me...turkey ski resort disaster? needless to say
		i felt a bit lost, then much later i again dreamt 
		train station...nothing as nice as the kremlin lines
		or as dingy as the manhattan queens bronx stops,
		no something in between - possibly in europe...
		large white structures which i somehow stepped
		out of then unaware of my location or which way
		to go...in wandering and asking, how do i get back
		to the train station that goes everywhere, a woman
		volunteered to drive me...she seemed to be a mail
		carrier yet her car was a jigsaw puzzle of a station
		wagon - open at the back so the seats had to be turned
		so as to pretend the door was shut - i think she looked
		like shirley jackson...i'm two hundred pages into hangsaman -
		i can sort of tell when and where she leaves hints of
		herself...some weird synchronicty was going down as
		i read her writing about milton and i had very recently
		mentioned here the reference to the rose of sharon from
		paradise lost...moreover the sudden trailer for amanda's
		seven veils...two other men get in the post woman's rinky
		dink car and i awake before she gets in the driver;s seat -
		i was also in the middle of viewing the french film
		'a second act' it is terribly exciting in that there are
		two scripts streaming in the form of a romance as well as
		the actors really reacting to eachother as if in ad libs
		or so it seems when the lines are really good - i left
		it to give it more attention later...
		      (not long after i learned the story about
		      steely dan's second arrangement...along
		      with how one of them was dumped and then
		      hit by a car...this was gaucho...they say
		      one of the recording engineers erased the
		      masters and the new take didn't feel right
		      so it was left off the album, somehow there
		      are surfaced renditions of the tune now...
		      i gave it a listen, not exactly sure if
		      i liked it...then i borrowed the notion that
		      they didn't like it either since they never
		      played it live and so the eraser tale might
		      simply be a myth to add to the legend of 
		      their last record which indeed has other
		      great songs...it is only fair to state that
		      other ears consider the "lost" song as genius...)
		      i gave an extra
		turn to the newer scales and went to sleep...which i am
		about to attempt again - sleep, that is, given that i
	        only slept for a couple of hours as if i needed to 
		see it was the sly hotel and wish for lotta's success more
		sincerely as i felt some sort of intensity and then
		possibly became too casual or even distracted in what
		i termed worship. 
			      post-script, lots of thought in dream
		      instead of dreaming...is the rock and roll hall
		      of fame for rap, does that mean spoken word will
		      be included...i agree with jerry that it is another
		      category but i also think the nature of rebellion
		      does exist in some rap - i mean sabotage by the
		      beastie boys could be either rock or rap...the
		      contradiction comes becomes irony as a lot of spoken word
		      artists do not play any instruments unless one
		      is more careful in judgement and views the vocal
		      as a type of musical instrument in the way actors
		      view their body...but then does that mean that
		      ai composed songs will be eligible for such honors...
		      my feeling is that it is all right to not limit
		      what rock was or will be yet for my money if there
		      is no guitar it ain't rocking and i think that is
		      what garcia meant...
		      aside from pondering in the lake of rapid eye
		      movement...before rising from bed, i felt as if a
		      hairdresser studying the back of someone's head -
		      i think it was someone i didn't like and still don't,
		      which reminds me that i also thought and dreamt of
		      an ex-girlfriend...no i do not know how to balance
		      friendships and love...does marriage mean no real
		      friends, it can't be or maybe why so many divorces...
		      i can't seem to clearly define devotion without
		      some sort of disregard for new faces yet that
		      feels extreme as it produces a weird guilt since
		      no one is above or better than anyone else yet
		      equally to accept someone alongside love leads
		      to impossible confusion. no fair solution. i hope
		      i am being as kind as possible to all that care about
		      me, especially the women. to give a specific example
		      i should have already taken the time to listen to 
		      julia yet in my concern for self and worship i left
		      it for later...as you can see, i am wrong even if
		     i am right because in setting boundaries to my bliss
		      i have missed that moment...and i wonder if by 
		      respecting someone am i disrespecting another...
		      but i mean no disrespect, or as hunter put placed
		      it, 'pay the ticket; take the ride.' yes, we
		      are professionals, after all or will our children
		      face the induction of sped-up renditions of songs..
		      ps, speaking of songs hollywood land was re-released
		      now as i fininshed reading the novel...the writing
		      in the ending parts is nothing short of wonderful
		      however since i picked it up after seeing the film
		      i was expecting natalie to go missing...yet i can 
		      see her point in terms of poetry...that is the girl
		      we are reading about by the end is not the same girl
		      from the start...there is an evolution, an arch, a 
		      journey which i suppose she meant to empower future
		      girls...you don't have to fit in, you can overcome
		      the feelings and even the failures filling up the
		      pathway...moreover it blended nearly to a match with
		      the ending of 'hotel'...without the scream, of course. 
		      <br>

		      23 january<br>
		      <br>
		      'a second act' turned out too good to explain, exceeding
		      itself somehow and whatever it is one might be expecting.
		      even the tracking shot ending shooting its own trail...
		      well, there really there are no words to describe it
		      without giving away extensive spoilers so i will simply
		      recommend it to dear readers that enjoy goodly cinema. 
		      excellent. i went to sleep a bit later searching around
		      nearly aimlessly except to see if the flight from berlin
		      had gotten into stockholm...in my dream i am running
		      with only shoes and shorts - it is the upper west side
		      - broadway and i notice a woman making herself at home
		      on the sidewalk by one of the columbia buildings - there
		      is a dollar bill in triangular shape which i step on
		      while jogging and for a second think to grab it yet
		      at the same time think of paris france and how some
		      flimflam folk put place money in front of themselves
		      to trip up the unsuspecting person passing by so i
		      keep going on my way - now with a panic that i have
		      left without taking my keys yet i feel them in a 
		      pocket on the right side - a moment later i notice
		      a crowd and turn away to run down amsterdam avenue
		      and head back home...three men of the crowd seem
		      to be chasing me and my left shoe needs to be adjusted
		      as i was wearing it like a slipper and now needed to
		      go faster - i adjust the sneaker and start to race yet
		      pretty soon they are upon me - well one of them is -
		      i neither recognixe the face nor like it and i start
		      saying 'only titty only' not knowing exactly why
		      or possibly 'only teeter only' 
		      as he reaches for me i twist his wrist into a break
		      suddenly returning to the speed of my stride yet
		      scared then awaking confused...not over the borderline
		      nightmare as it is maybe par for course in terms of
		      city dwelling but the utterly bizarre phrase spoken
		      as if a foreign girl trying to save herself without
		      knowing the english words for what she was trying to 
		      convey in order to escape...earlier in the day, after
		      taking a shower, i felt an intense pain invading my
		      right thigh and upon waking i wondered if there was 
		      a connection...hmm, the keys were the ones before 
		      they switched to an expensive multi-lock key or so
		      it seemed from the feel of them...weird, i still
		      have those keys for no specific reason. 
		      <br>
		      <br>
		      24 january
		      <br>
		      i failed to consider the dream in terms of time travel...
		      ttty is word coined in 1820...yet before and after that
		      date there were; tittymal, tittymal, tittytotty, tittybar,
		      tittybag, and tittybottle or one could go futher back into
		      into the 1700s with tittup, tittuping, and later tittupy...
		      as for teeter, it's from the Middle English titeren 
		     to totter, reel; akin to Old High German zittarōn to shiver...
		      i thought it could be a chinese mispronounciation due to
		      the R if it was teeter yet the idea doesn't work since it
		      is at the end of the word...in any case, i felt awful
		      sad through the morning yesterday and pretty unwilling
		      to do much in the afternoon...the only bright period
		      was viewing the hangman, no relation to hangsaman, as
		      i did not recall watching tina in a motion picture...
		      as much as i am opposed to the boob tube, i sure 
		      cannot deny being raised and entertained by it...
		      it was also nice to see demi get a nom even if the
		      academy did not respect the balance by leaving margaret
		      out as it were...anyway i still wanted to nothing
		      and carried on in that manner until deciding at the
		      last minute to switch back to an earlier design for
		      my web domains...but this was only due to the fact 
		      that the videos were not playing in opera mobile browsers-
		      they seemed fine on chrome and the desktop version of
		      opera and safari mobile...which is prolly still the case
		      as i hope opera mobile will return to normal...so all
		      i did was that and eat leftovers with lettuce then
		      a bag of chips and a cute chunk of gouda...sprite,
		      coffee, cigarettes, and scales...it even felt like
		      too much of a task to bathe...although i did shave...
		      spirit of lynch perhaps, the solitary ant crawling
		      around my cellphone out of nowhere...they were sugar
		      ants but they were coming in for water, he had said
		      once upon a time...i had recently read laura's letter
		      with feelings and memories so exact that no one could
		      believe me if i told them...my conflict with this arises
		      from the michael j anderson slander and the julee cruise
		      rant although in her case it was later edited down so
		      that it is not easily found online whereas the man from
		      the other place was basically silenced by itself being
		      so extreme as well as by the lack of response it got -
		      jennifer did argue against it but i believe she is the
		      only one...i note these things as conflicts within myself
		      because i always felt they, not jen, were sort of the 
		      pieces, important pieces, that belonged to lynch, that
		      were part of him or his persona if you will...if you
		      look for the dwarf it will only say he is 'retired' and
		      the crooner will say she committed suicide while listening
		      to the b-52s' roam...yes i know this must not be interesting
		      to anyone else yet my emotional investment in the lynchian
		      universe is left with that chaos...i've always felt his
		      characters were a sort of family - i suppose it still makes
		      sense given the turmoil within my actual family...i suspect
		      this will never be resolved...maybe i should consider it 
		      'nonexistent'...now these thoughts are shared to also clarify
		      why i gave mja space in the list while dedicating the song
		      to dl and "liking' so many tribute posts at instagram...
		      one and the same, it was about the arm and the giant...but
		      that is  how i saw this 'giant' director and him...to think 
		      of it he saw it too, otherwise why would he cast the arm
		      atop the throne of mulholland drive...let me conclude this
		      with a quote from it, "You want me to make this easy for you?
		      No fucking way! It's not gonna be. It's not easy for me!"
		      in my dream there is a big plate of bacon although i have
		      been keeping kosher for sometime now, as i eat i wonder if
		      it is the facon that i heard emily speak of...i don't miss
		      it and this is also the case with most food...i suppose
		      i see it as a mere necessity...something to do while watching
		      a film...i left a short film called the death of a shadow
		      when i realized it was a short film...even if it did seem
		      enticing in some ways...like meat-flavored ice cream, i
		      think well i like short films but how will i ever get around
		      to them or worse list the ones about writers...and if so
		      would one not be forced to include social media tapes in the
		      category...i can hardly do my job in terms of tvc15...
		      when i looked it up, i noticed a dozen titles but then as
		      i researched i found there is no end to it not now with
		      the several many prodco's spilling out a series every 
		      couple of days...later in my dream, i am standing in a
		      room where a man has just been murdered, they are putting
		      him in a sort of duffel bag or heavy trash bag that is
		      tightened by tape at the ankle torso and neck areas...
		      i guess we are going to dump the body in the nearest 
		      lake or river...perhaps ocean...somehow i am neither
		      surprised nor interested in the proceedings...i had gone
		      to complete harlot's ghost yet i found i had actually 
		      read most of it and it wasn't helping my inertia -
		      turning to the letters of shirley jackson i started
		      thinking of cake as she mentions it and put that away
		      as well not wanting to excite myself over the only
		      food i actually craved a few months ago...maybe i have
		      simply read too much and need to press pause on the books.
		      <br>
		      <br>
		      25 january<br>
		      <br>
		      dream of no easy situation - an airport it seemed,
		      all the luggage is on the floor...there is a man
		      that would appear to have been looking through them -
		      he is now in a squat beside a large collection of 
		      lipsticks as if inspecting them - it is then i say
		      something not audible enough to recollect as he
		      removes some of the caps and flings the lower portion
		      in a manner that can only be described as disdain -
		      i believe it is at this point that i got up for a second
		      to turn off the fan as i actually felt the cool sweet
		      air of winter...the lights had gone out before i went
		      to sleep but not more than half an hour...earlier
		      they had been out for three hours...i felt as if
		      it was some sort of signal...i had mostly escaped
		      some caravan song blaring out on the street and
		      even the mobile aguacate vendor shouts as well as
		      the compramos todo lo que sea viejo mantra with
		      murder on the dancefloor headphone playing...a
		      signal that the intrusive sounds are required?
		      well, the lights go out now as i tyoe this -
		      i flick ashes into my coffee instead of ashtray
		      in the sudden darkness - the bar game we played
		      on doped dummy's when they turned their heads...
		      over the hills and faraway - where was i oh yeah
		      faced with the non electric chunk of time i washed
		      my hair and watched 'ace in the hole' - a pretty
		      worthwhile study of character and intuition...
		      somehow it was getting late and i went into
		      my scale ritual then bed fromw which you already
		      have the scene noted...later i dreamt i was 
		      shopping naked...didn't feel strange as i 
		      pulled at bags to gather the goods except then
		      it wasn't groceries but gaby or gabriella...
		      i guess i need to find a middle ground name for
		      her since the first feels too informal and the
		      second quadruples the syllables...i think it
		      is the only time i have dreamt of her...not
		      much time to play or pal around as some strange
		      and strong man insisted on displaying his talent
		      of twusting necks - the ghost of burt reynolds
		      said something but i could only think hey it's
		      burt reynolds...you know fangirl syndrome - anyway
		      one guy gets his neck twisted and seems to die,
		      then another stands before the strange strong
		      man and the same happens but this time he props
		      him up and twists again until the poor fellow
		      returns to life or at least what is left of 
		      life after a near death experience...somehow
		      this leads to me buying a suit, i am trying on
		      a quasy fancy teal blazer and i tell the sales
		      person that the sleeves are too long which he
		      refutes - showing me that he is wearing the same
		      jacket and it is fine on him failing to take into
		      account that i'm 5'7 and he is at least 5'9 maybe
		      six feet tall...we wander over to find a replacement -
		      now back at where i had got the bags - the strange
		      strong man is surrounded by law enforcement agents
		      and pulls out ice skates to cut the soles of his
		      feet, i notice them bloody and think he is going
		      to launch himself into battle, his type of warpaint
		      i suppose...i woke up not really caring to find out
		      what became of that brute...a sigh moment after
		      typing that sentence the lights flip on...my eyes
		      adjust...my only plan for the day is to avoid the
		      delivery of cash that was sent despite me insisting
		      the money be used to hurry the arrival of my new
		      guitar...in my calculations it seems logical...get
		      it monday after i know the box is on its way. 
		      <br>
		      <br>
		      26 jan
		      <br>
		      about yesterday, how could i ever call that a day?
		      it was a saturday, yet minutes after typing that
		      note, there it was again another lights out moment
		      that lasted hours leaving the soup incomplete...
		      the only bright spot was avoiding all the noises
		      via headphones yet even that was soured by the
		      return of the delivery man as if intent on seeing
		      me...shouting the name he thinks is me and somehow
		      getting in the building and banging on the front
		      door...i was playing scales which i actually did
		      thrice while waiting in the dark...thinking why
		      would someone do that without first confirming
		      via phone...it is the usual proceedure...olives
		      chips and cheese with a lukewarm sprite as i 
		      watched the linguini incident, am awful movie
		      that has one magical scene where the lead actress
		      questions how many would like to see her drown
		      and turn blue at which point the real wife of
		      the lead actor raises her hand...it's a howl!
		      by the time i got to the soup i didn't want it
		      but had it anyway for the sake of nourishment -
		      the awaited package did not get past set up and
		      is supposed to go out today or tomorrow...i was
		      neither disappointed nor surprised but sort of
		      weirded out by how the whole day went...anyway
		      it will still take a couple of weeks to arrive...
		      dreams never arrived except for a very clear
		      and nearly impossible vision of a man that i can
		      only describe as a santa claus type, marx every
		      body nose there ain't no sanity clause, uhm yea
		      white hair and beard in a glowing living room
		      with a fireplace chimney like i have never seen
		      before...it was nearly shocking as it made me
		      think of the letter jfk wrote to that child who
		      asked if there was such a thing...i awoke with
		      everything feeling far away...even the coffee.
		      on my second cup, i suppose it would all be all
		      right if in fact lotta didn't feel so far away...
		      i am about to look at her new video now, it 
		      seemed unusual that she showed no enthusiasm
		      for berlin, no reaction in a sense...in fact
		      she posted a scene from the rose club instead -
		      i don't know how i remember such details yet
		      i can only imagine that i do for some specific
		      reason...now sunday, which turn will this take?
		      <br>
		      <br>
		      27 january<br>
		      <br>
		      what was sunday, well it started off weird
		      and nearly desperate although i'd be hard pressed
		      to offer explanations...like awaking to a feeling
		      that the day has already paased you by, left you
		      too late to catch up...how strange you may ask,
		      well to jizz in the pants while not exactly 
		      excited while sitting down is how...then i
		      planned a night full of rain along with rice
		      and steak yet i couldn't get through it and
		      i didn't really want to go back...i gave up
		      and took a nap wherein i dreamt i was fixing
		      a shower...standing in water facing three
		      shower heads one of them was overloaded with
		      frames, like eight by ten picture frames,
		      i removed these and showed them to someone,
		      an older man that was not pleased and threatened
		      to fire me...maybe in some dream world i am a 
		      plumber...well knowing i have no career ambition
		      in that area i return to the showerheads and
		      slide them up the wall, they are all spouting
		      or squirting if you will...i remove one and find
		      a flexible hose which i put place in mouth as
		      one does when siphoning gasoline...i am surprised
		      then that i can breathe perhaps believing myself
		      underwater...i awake and see lotta's shower...
		      it makes me feel more in sync with myself and
		      i even find a guitar case sale which i jump on -
		      five or six guitars with only one case, obviously
		      i need help...but then seeing her praise some
		      tv actor takes me all the way back to too much
		      heaven and i let the song float around for a while
		      even looking at the chords...pictures of you by the
		      cure might have been more adequate yet not as pleasant...
		      i go to sleep feeling like a peasant in a kingdom
		      which taxes and takes no notice of peasants...
		      i dream of the now antique batman, specifically
		      adam west...yet it's all vague...nothing to report,
		      it is my preferred batman in terms of style and
		      writing...those scribes never got enough credit...
		      although their scripts are the blueprint for the
		      caped crusader's empire...i suppose there were
		      other scenes which simply escaped...i only recall
		      the vivid replaying of one of my songs - dialdialler,
		      or some may think it is called high fidelity...
		      so i awake at least feeling all right about the music
		      except was the whole week about some wicked doppleganger,
		      youtube video ad twice seen parents telling a child
		      we never told you you had a twin sibling...good
		      grief charlie brown...did the act of giving my
		      plumber shoes turn out worse for wear...is the road
		      to hell paved with good intentions...and why did
		      bat token make it a dispute in refusing to deposit
		      the final pay out...the browser row rekindled while
		      searching for a replacement to opera mobile...
		      i research butter now unwilling to study porn
		      for the previous fright, i am looking for the
		      golden canned one with a cow's head on the label,
		      i might be mistaken over the bovine but not the 
		      light bronze shiny color...i come up with golden
		      churn butter and wijsman but think maybe red
		      feather has a new label...anyway something like
		      this might be an option since they have a long
		      shelf life...moreover, i found there is a such
		      a thing as powdered butter which supposedly one
		      merely adds water and voila...who knew? leads
		      to the trite what will they think of next...
		      wait i should have said beurre bretel instead
		      of red feather but since i am not certain of
		      the pronounciation i will let it be...i will
		      conclude this particular note with the buffalo
		      lament, we all saw the ball hit the ground but
		      the refs now seem to allow the chiefs a completion
		      as the nfl appears to want another taylor swift
		      super bowl...it would be shocking if jane's addiction
		      had not wroted 'nothing's shocking'...
		      <br>
		      <br>
		      28 january<br>
		      <br>
		      tuesday. i should clarify 'a night full of rain'...
		      it was interesting however i might not have been
		      in the right state of mind to enjoy it, so i left
		      italy of the late sixties or early seventies only
		      to return to italy in the forties...that is to 
		      say; across the river and into the trees...
		      obviously for danny huston but as i watched i
		      found i could not turn away from viewing...it
		      is such a gentle poem which contains such harsh
		      and rough lines, like a wood carving...for most
		      of it i did not recognize matilda perhaps too
		      thrilled by the plot and how i understood nearly 
		      all the native talking except when the black shirts
		      stood by the cafe speaking...anyway i really liked
		      this one even if the ending matched what i was 
		      expecting, i suppose i didn't expect liev to be
		      that good and deangelis was great...there were
		      moments when her expression said so much, well
		      her eyes...yet let me not over do it as i don't
		      want anyone looking at it as if it needs to be
		      true for them, that was my truth in that point in
		      time, i cannot guarantee such magic for anyone else -
		      for all i know, you might prefer ' a night full of rain'...
		      which i left after only a few minutes...
		      monday was the day the money came, it reminds me
		      of the mae west quip when she is told ten men
		      are waiting for her and she says send one of them
		      home because i am feeling a bit tired...i ordered
		      a coke and non menthol smokes, since pepsi has
		      basically been outlawed here and the sweet cigarettes
		      were going too quickly...all week i awoke as if 
		      sleeping strained my back and then sit worried, smoking
		      and wondering what on earth is going on...like there
		      is an invisible jigsaw puzzle which then leaves me
		      reluctant to engage with the rest of the day...what is
		      that horrible word i hardly ever use...ah yes lethargic.
		      a few minutes after the soda and so called cancer sticks,
		      the pizza arrived, luckily i looked before unlocking 
		      the door to see yet again someone intent on mixing in
		      behind the delivery as if i was also greeting them...
		      enjoyment seemed out of the question as i face the
		      pie thinking of how late it already was which then
		      translated into staying up way past my bed time...
		      in feeling i had to finish seeing the film, then
		      finalizing the new domain designs and augmenting
		      the cinema list...finally in bed, bowie songs
		      i had heard the day before howled in memory -
		      as if the time i knew that delivery was knocking
		      returned like a spiritual investigation...i guess
		      there is a danger in handing over a piece of
		      identification to receive them dollars...but 
		      there is no other logical way to do such things...
		      well, not until electronic currency becomes the
		      standard...i went to sleep sort of praying that
		      the box had been picked up and was now on its
		      way...christmas in february...i hesitate to continue
		      since i don't want to name the actress i was thinking
		      of then possibly dreaming of but honestly i think
		      there was a message and i don't know who those women
		      in my dream were...all i know was one was blonde and
		      the other not so blonde...if brunette or even darker
		      hair i cannot say...she was extremely happy with me
		      but i kept wondering why the blonde was upset as it
		      seemed to have something to do with me...something
		      i did or did not do? she only walked away when i tried
		      to ask...if i let instinct have its say, well then 
		      obviously i have put placed lotta well beyond what
		      would be fair in terms ot attention and so jealousy
		      might be the easy answer...there have been days where
		      not much gets done other thinking of her...this stems
		      from other questions i cannot quiz myself with and
		      expect correct answers as well as the blurred stance
		      which cannot lean into an exact emotion given all
		      that has transpired. not just with her, but with
		      myself. not to mention the impossible situation
		      which has no way to balance itself in terms of
		      'family' life and the utterly ironic fact of folks
		      then disguised to dismantle affection for their 
		      own favor. in other words, situations i cannot
		      control and once in a while make me jump to 
		      conclusions that drift too far away from the rational.
		      from the real. if nothing is good or bad based on
		      thinking or point of view, there should be no feeling
		      involved yet since we all know there is - there are
		      emotions, well - it must be
		      that ol willy shakes was partly mistaken in that
		      particular line...
