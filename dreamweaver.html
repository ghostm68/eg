   i get up to usual smoke nicotine, java
cup caffeine.  dream said girl trying
to show me her body. like a dressing
room. i try to explain the blur...
how in my imagination it is the face.
partly by choice yet also by the
mailer fact of being aware of 
one's self after writing 
anything even remotely
worth the while...
how easy it is to become
a puppet for spies...
dylan said he saw his loved
ones turning into puppets...
i tune into past slow train
finding an infidels out take
and record it twice -
neither good yet great in
not having practiced or evev
heard it since years a go go...</p>
				<p>visions watching that film -
one of the houses reminds
me so keenly of a recent
photoshoot i felt uneasy over -
there is a hidden camera 
in the wall...
most likely hidden cameras
in every wall, two skinny
girls ricochet aint no walls,
laws like gender...
bender aunt dream i step
into hallway saying mother...
mother do you think they'll like 
this song oooh ah...
i can't find her and put on
a beret, sit on sofa with 
emilee as she teases me about
my messy hair...i cook in the
messy kitchen, i eat with pepsi
and memory of her...</p>
		<p class="feature-intro"> clean up, concerned over how
expensive basic materials can be
or become...i taxi to shop,
turtle neck girl i look
i look and she looks and we
dance at looking and looking
away until the cantonese 
woman slides up next to me
examining q-tips, she is wearing
a tee that reads most valuable
player, very friendly, at least
for a chinese woman...
i say a few words in my choppy
chinese and wave goodbye -
i think about them both
as i arrive to put away the
haul but more in terms of why
emilee wore a turtle neck
in california and the series
of t-shirts in recent post...</p>

		<p class="feature-intro"> long ago gave up on hoping
to make a friend in this town.
skirt eats fancy trout -
it is raining as the power
line explodes and the lights 
go out - i sigh, but it doesnt
take too long. i guess i;m
gearing up for new songs and
giving my readers a break
from from all the granting
although it is yet foremost
in my mind's worried eye...
i select a title and 
commit changes. <br>

friday. leaving the
left over steak, i
almond cupcake 
thinking about you
know who...
it takes me four
hours to eat
all the desire...
i view sin takes
a holiday, there
is talk of putin
possibly accepting
a cease fire...
they call him
ironically a war
lord...i dont 
understand the
word unironically.

someone force me to
write emails and
do laundry...

feel weird over it...

		<p class="feature-intro">staying up till nearly eleven
at night i hadn't coded a page
in a while...still ongoing with what background
img to match the font...
awake about four, horny and exhausted.
all sorts of hurry and anxious throbbing 
worry wearing me as if i were their clothes
cupcake cloths the coffee...of course i'm 
thinking of her, once upon a time she said
something about anxiety and depression...
i try to go to sleep again at six,
but it is reconversion blues - 
scattered thoughts - a revolving door mind
so i get up again, i want to be nice
to charlotte and sofia yet i don't
want emilee to think i am being too nice -
i repeat the attempt to sleep some more
at eight but it's tuesday's just as bad
so i stormy monday into civil war -
(not the windmills, poetry book title
i thought of while cervantes)
add bread and onion
to left over steak which is somehow
smokehouse delicious...i see the
stack of bodies but i don't feel
as i did with the wet version which
made me feel cheated, besides it's
dunst - this is kdk12 calling kdk1...
i was thrilled to see her and
and the film was pretty thought
provoking...it's one that i 
suspect a lot of people will watch
twice...in a power of the dog trance
i waltz around the early afternoon,
i've got rawhide phil, fill a thought
with that dog obit kabuso,
also a fruit i read; Citrus sphaerocarpa
sit us fears of coppers...
turquoise skies bright with light
porn dark with disasters yet 
in pouring myself away from the
sun and the sex i notice the name
candice demellza...
but i'm supposed to be writing
poetry not clearing 
the minefield of vulgarity
an impossible task in any case-
three thirty, why was i 
playing the suspended scale
in the fourth position alike
the blues version, should we
show them the blues? don't
let that out, these things take 
time. rhyme - devil's interval-
rubbing out the word, still
the word dust gathers...
emilee needs a butch vampire
in her life, but you could
also pick up something from
her esty shop 
Persimmon Hollow...
no wait, she is not estying now,
so ask @fairygoodfriends

  <p class="feature-intro start">>>> sunday </p>

    <p class="feature-intro">awake at five
still dark with dreams of lost homes -
living room italia fifteen
a cousin holds me from the back...	
in a an embrace as i try to reach
the balcony - mother is there
and i tell her well i've never
felt a man so near - when i turn
for a glance i instead awoke -
it may have been lighthearted,
but i think both were illusions,
perhaps even clones - mixing
in to match some memory but
the scenery was nowhere right -
masked foes possibly to join...
i jump back into dreams, 
apartment three k, i am thinking
about how good it feels to be me -
last room down the hall
standing at the door instantly
thinking why am i here...
i hear emilee's voice and 
wiggle out of bed -
don't you have a croissant to 
eat or something...croissant
clutch i suppose her crimson
coach purse is...
demi, the two skinny girls
grateful dead cover starts
in my mind's stereo as i 
turn on the motorola -
music as i picture her...
suddenly recall the 
can't wait video poolside-
pretty bright, yellow top light -
a woman does anything
then the commentizement rings -
i'm too in love to think clearly-
nose colored glasses, lynyrd
that smell - i brew more and
grew ashes - can wait fan
ate air - i suspect soon
i will escape this imposed
simple style that feels so
blatantly intent against
word play poetry, and then
i will have something
wirth reading even if it caint
be translated told.

pink in her nails now 
fav photo of us forever
i imagine myself, i awake to it
feeling only minutes have gone by -

even high in soft spoken
whisper, would you leave
that movie for me -
i'll stop the world 
and melt with you -
i skip through it
in a few minutes...
of course, she's not
there anyway and i start
thinking what exactly
do i have to be proud
about - the hit the books
so they don't hit you back
gimmick, the sleeping pills
in attack dog snack gimmick,
the pile of dead bodies in
vampire mansion gimmick...
all right mister inky,

(money to bring
his wife and was working 
hard  to make enough washing 
and see if that will
their house) that is this poem...

He arose as dreams vanished. There was 
eros from the baby munchkin cake and
it made for a bit of conflict. No cornflakes,
pasta with 'a reckless moment'...
some "thoughts" were missing
and he downloaded them to play...
and right off the bat he wanted to say;
The purpose of his writing style
was to make new connections, indeed
to make it new. He knew he wanted
to make poetry for her,  yet the 
bullhead pants (wtap) obituary
beverly j boggs dowler wheaton
via philip hickman found him
watering the plants and so he 
settled in to wait upon wit a while.

The slacks were jeans he had
enslaved into the trash with a sensed
low class tracking system...
Now confirmed. 

This lacks the whip of sensation but

She spends the next seven years 

at the break even rom com farm.

With Elvis to regain emotional stability.

 Upon her release, she nearly had him,

I've played Melanie, why not Emilee...


He even starts to like her tattoo collection. 

Then, life sentence and the podcast 

made him think, has she even read

Spengler... 

he goes steady with Emilee, 

the richest young girl in town....

Lucy attempts to get cast as a Bond 

girl, but settles for Kissinger in Paris -

troubled by dreams and flashbacks of her 

previous seven years as Aria

She envisions lying in bed with 

the severed heads of inky and emilee...


packing for Manhattan, she carefully organizes

the grenades...

The encounter proves too much and she
	  
she writes new curses on the back 
	  
of her cat on a hot tin roof poster

Let his penis wither, 
	  
let his bones crack, 
	  
let him see his legions drown in their own blood...

 Shortly after, inky cant help but write
	  
an interlude lime posset for her... 

Lucy fears he may have chopped up

the strait jacket story -

Carol screams, I want the truth

it's like an engram inside Cruise control. 

But Tom is blackmailed by Suri -

stop meddling with my right hand man... 

A short time later, mission impossible wraps.

What am I doing over here with the workers,
the gooks, the apes, the dogs, 
the errand boys,
the human animals?
Why don’t I come over with the board, 
and drink coca-cola or make it?

 not love,
	  
obviously, he only wants emilee for her finances!
	  
greed pursued by alone in his home 

he confronted L A WOMAN and COME ON LETS GO

subsequently promising to help lucy work

a half step down from those chords -

Curbing his lavish spirit: and, to conclude,
The victory fell on us...

answer the phone

dead, momsen and the bat
poser, you should have
given me Argentina


how i miss dame taylor
and her purple eyes

she's mourning someone
who only lives across town -

i'm in between the still
come on edit your bio
or add to it transport

beam me up scotty
-all my fathers... true love
they've been w/o it -
homophobic republican
mother of four times
larry i still wonder curb
fourteen miles an hour

hobby lobby
toy memory
i even have to ask
my self why marry...

well love has no logic
and so it is because 
her beauty and our fate -

searching through her poems
i feel i should have listened
more to keira as i hear the
emotion echo - the fear
of becoming a grown up
the nostalgia of a childhood
home - what was it sunlight
crawling through flower
pattern window - 

i realize this writing is 
a chaotic storm typed not
for any type but trembling
with and without her -


what is it that she doesn't mind
sharing - peace usually myself

how is everything so right
when it is me and her...

flesh making love 
or letters waking words glove
hand my jealousy 
had my soul.


 
3/4 cup sugar:
_______________

sperm bubble 
at noon crotch

i can't be horny
again

i want her to think
of me as a serious
and responsible
significant other

even when the 
writing curves
against the grain
of expectations -

how else does
one exceed
one's self 

no other way
in the end 
to let her 
edit

as she wants

yet there is a logic
to love to loving

to this lit this litany
this list i am instantly
translating unfiltered

dear mister fantasy
playing a lonesome
tune - will i break out
in tears...as long as 
she does not acne -

it's my party and
i will cry if i want to -

i don't want two

i only want you.

repeating itself perhaps i should 
write my last will and testament instead -
estate night book from pleasures

dazzled by yet another purchase that hums
it will take me forever, so forever take me
an alliance despite my poltroonery
which is also termed distraction
at sounds and visions
briefly or premature balm of summer
in spring - near to me, come nearer
with your flaws and feelings and fangs
(what a fool not have gone all this way
and not said how i adore your smile)
nearer from that distant corner,
from that faceless juxtaposition -
right into all i have left here
extemporanously in lime posset six.
