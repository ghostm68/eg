   <h1>dreamweaver three</h1>
        <p><b>
         hmm...14 July 2025.<br>
		i dedicated June to not much at all -<br>
		it felt as if i had wroted a novel<br>
		instead of dream notes...i kept<br>
		wondering over the puzzle of the<br>
		last penned dream herein...it <br>
		was too vivid, maybe too much...<br>
		i only knew that i had to end<br>
		the notes there in order to <br>
		start over...it was an estimated<br>
		three hundred pages if double spaced -<br>
		well, i've put those away and here<br>
		goes...monday, daria called her<br>
		puppy her soulmate...i felt in <br>
		a daze...on the fifth of july,<br>
		i happend to see a picture of<br>
		two friends, children...i kept <br>
		wishing i hadnt seen it, but<br>
		even as cut off as i am from <br>
		most folks and i suppose even <br>
		some of my own emotions, that<br>
		scene really got to me...<br>
		i was in the middle of writing<br>
		some new songs and wrote four<br>
		verses...the fourth was left out<br>
		when it came to recording - <br>
		it took a couple of days to settle <br>
		into it...when i finally escaped<br>
		noisy distractions, the sudden phone<br>
		calls insisting on either hanging up or<br>
		pointless trivia, the strange hound<br>
		seemingly in search of boy-vagina,<br>
		and an insane argument about the beach...<br>
		(what else could it be except madness when<br>
		i have no inclination or desire to sit in the sun)<br>
		oh yes and the bizarre 'no input' mystery<br>
		which i suppose is all part of the process, like<br>
		pound might say...<br>indeed, when i finally escaped<br>
		nothing mattered but the work at hand...i called<br>
		it 'the fifth of july' and put it out for release<br>
		with these lyrics;<br>
		<BR>
		I KNEW LILA WAS DEAD <br>
		- HOPED ELOISE WOULD SURVIVE;<br>
		SHE LOVED HER PUPPY DOG, <br>
		SHE HADNT EVER BEEN WED.<br>
<br>
		A HOUSE DANCED <br>
		ON A RIVER'S SONG AS IT PLAYED<br>
		LONE STAR STATE OF TEXAS <br>
		YEAH SOMEHOW STAYED...<br>
<br>
		I COULDNT TELL HANNAH AND REBECCA APART<br>
		- THEY WERE TWINS LIKE<br>
		FLOWERS IN A FIELD'S GARDEN <br>
		- IT'D BEEN THAT WAY RIGHT FROM THE START<br>
		<br>
		A HOUSE DANCED<br>
		UPON A RIVER <br>
		(A RIVER'S SONG AS IT PLAYED)<br>
		LONE STAR STATE OF TEXAS<br>
		WE SOMEHOW STAYED...<br>
		<BR>
		LITTLE BLAIR COULDNT UNDERSTAND <br>
		- SHE WEPT SHE CRIED;<br>
		LITTLE BROOKE COVERED HER <br>
		SAYING COME ON GIRL HOLD MY HAND<br>
		
		<br>
		A HOUSE DANCED <br>
		UPON A RIVER'S SONG AS IT PLAYED<br>
		LONE STAR STATE OF TEXAS<br>
		WE SOMEHOW STAYED...<br>
		<BR>
		
		A HOUSE DANCED <br>
		UPON A RIVER <br>
		(A RIVER'S SONG AS IT PLAYED)<br>
		LONE STAR STATE OF TEXAS <br>
		WE SOMEHOW STAYED...<br>
		<BR>         
		      
		      i'd put placed all four verses on vsco from <br>
		handwritten notes photographed along with the chords<br>
		which remained the same...save for an added note<br>
                musical note. <br>
		as i glance through recollections, wondering why julia<br>
		mecey and joey king enjoy love island, wondering if<br>
		charles bukowski actually dropped a man at the race track<br>
		as in the italic section of factum or even why sylvia<br>
		plath's ghost doesnt haunt the hell out of matt haig...<br>
		i remember that night, the fourth of july...<br>
		i dreamt something like a bridge or a dam where the water<br>
		was red, crimson, but in that nearly dried blood brown color<br>
		and i couldn't see where i was but i saw a man holding a shotgun<br>
		and he did not move or speak, the motionless image against the <br>
		waves were etched in my mind the following day...i thought it<br>
		was about a guitar that had been slow to arrive and that<br>
		possibly it had suffered in transit yet by the time i went to<br>
		sleep again it felt revealed...well, decyphered...neither spirit<br>
		nor worry could save these lives from the devastation waltz<br>
		winding its way in what they call flash flood alley...<br>
		i was certain it was william s burroughs, a man who knew<br>
		about loss in an intimate way...aside from the wife, his only<br>
		son had perished and even in the afterlife i suppose some<br>
		emotions keep, all you can do is stand there and bear witness<br>
		i learned also that gabrielle's mother and my own share<br>
		a birthdate as it were...<br>
		i don't want to write anymore about these things as in<br> 
		typing i might not reflect how much i felt and much less<br>
		how it all still hurts and will continue to hurt so many...<br>
		so i re-order that guitar and continue to wait...<br>
		i have a few dreams to jot, but those will be done<br>
		at some other point in time when i can turn my minimalist<br>
		writing into an even more concise style so as to not end<br>
		up with a book-length manuscript that might only serve<br>
		self-references...<br>
		
		<br>
		<br>
		16 july 2025<br>
		<br>
		i consider yesterday notable even if i don't<br>
		fully examine it here...<br>
		learning another side of the camp story...<br>
		what was her name, hayden...well she spoke<br>
		kinda like how i speak...<br>
		the second axe was shipped on the 11th<br>
		and arrived on the 15th<br>
		it felt as if my writing had manifested it...<br>
		reminds me of the telecaster except it <br>
		has a decided rock and roll tone<br>
		(no single coil pick ups)<br>
		i decorated it while listening to mustang sally<br>
		for a minute, everything else took a back seat<br>
		meaning it was thrilling...<br>
		i'm thinking now of a dream i had in may<br>
		i'd been with lotta in my old apartment<br>
		she kissed me and it was magical<br>
		we lay there talking about what the next meal<br>
		should be when a man with gun started shooting<br>
		at me and i ran into another room<br>
		there is a bookend dream to this scene which<br>
		i will jot later...<br>
		she's watching the summer i turned pretty<br>
		which i looked at but found revolting<br>
		i'm wearing a snake ring on my middle finger<br>
		instead of my stainless steel spoon since<br>
		some sort of rust invaded it...<br>
		anyway i awoke with a racing heart and <br>
		the realization of how much she means to me<br>
		hmm...when i said not much in june i meant movies too<br>
		although i did watch most of the secret life <br>
		of the american teenager<br>
		well, this was more than i intended to note...<br>
		let's leave it at that - for now -<br>
		here are two outtakes of the song i mentioned<br>
		i had the intent to adjust my release for one of<br>
		these but i couldn't figure out how to do that<br>
		and i am aware that this sort of takes the<br>
		expectation away from the single but i want <br>
		to share these as a way of saying it is<br>
		not about streams or whatever, it is what it is.<br>

		      correction, the mustang only sounded like
		      that through the boss amp...at the fender,
		      it was much nicer...yes i was fender-reluctant,
		      but since i don't much use pedals, the champ
		      amp was only logical...as for the guitar,
		      i kept hearing a line from blind willie mctell
		      when i would go window shopping for axes until
		      finally i didn't want to be haunted by it...
		      it is a step up from the ancient mustang i 
		      had which hardly ever stayed in tune but it
		      is not for big hands, even mine feel it to 
		      be a task going up the fret as if i had to
		      abbreviate my fingers which is the exact 
		      opposite of the jackson wherein my hands
		      sense and appropiate the space...
		      at least i feel a sort of bulgari vibe with
		      my new ring...still, all this goes against
		      my attempt at brevity and i have yet to
		      jot the dream note...hmm, notes..
		      connie francis died and her song had
		      recently become a hit again...even a parody
		      emerged, "you can touch my pussy..." which might
		      have been the cause of her demise...but
		      many several poets also passed away
		      and i had the evil urge to make a list
		      of all the writers that had perished
		      after 'the tortured poets depart-ment'
		      hmm...but what really worries me is
		      the grammar when gender is made illogical-
		      andrea is called 'they' instead of she -
		      here is quote/example:
		      "Their father, Mark, worked for a post office
		      and their mother, Shirley, was a secretary at a 
		      technical college. They have one sister, Laura."
		      this plural form makes language more of a virus
		      than it needs to be, indeed and why? 
		      where was i...ah yeah, i find 
		      lately that i go to sleep only to awake 
		      an hour or so later simply to wander
		      around in confusion...that was the case
		      last night, but first the bookend thing;
		      i had walked into a shop with julia and
		      told her to get something to drink, there
		      were only cans of coors in the fridge...
		      we walked out and there and then several
		      men harassed us, one of them with a stick
		      that knocked the hat off my head...it had
		      been a goodly time until then...weeks later
		      i learned that she had lost her red baseball cap -
		      cut to yesterady, i'm in the bath and the bath
		      is overflowing, i am trying without luck to 
		      shut off the water as somehow there are more
		      knobs than i care to count, i say the words
		      julia help but as i do i find the right knob
		      then we are on a bed where a cat climbs up,
		      i remark that it is not skirt and i think of
		      hedwig who it resembles but as a kitten - 
		      the cat speaks and i wonder if we have all gone
		      crazy...i awake and can't get back to sleep until
		      half a pack of cigarettes and coffee argue with
		      melatonin...i kept seeing romy mars although i 
		      only 'met' her at some far away chanel thing...
		      i like her especially since she positively proves
		      my point that sofia was and is pretty...the only 
		      thing is it makes mayhem of my fantasy life...
		      love her ego song - so catchy...
		      she had a bad scene at some hotel, in my dream
		      which i thought was about michael madsen, another
		      poet, i was in the elevator trying to get to the
		      twenty ninth floor - there was no 29 button,
		      someone pressed all the buttons and i got out
		      on seventeen determined to navigate the stairs -
		      1920s elegance surrounded me, someone with a 
		      glass case of coins, collectables, and aritfacts
		      was set up like a cigarette girl might be and 
		      i stopped for a glance there and then noticing 
		      a man seemingly having a heart attack nearby,
		      i kept walking after thinking about it all for 
		      a minute - as i contemplate it now it was like
		      the waldorf astoria...a minute ago having a grand
		      re-birth...i'd been there once upon a late night
		      frenzy...but i don't remember any stairs...not even 
		      much walking as yellow cabs did the work...miss
		      morin was at the chelsea hotel, i took a peek at 
		      how upscale 23rd street is now...i think it's where i 
		      bought that other mustang...i think it's still
		      there unlike music row on 48th...anyway, yes poets
		      are supposed to die like everyone else while
		      a few songs and verses live on but is it time
		      to advocate for protection of the scribes...
		      well, i dunno, but if someone whats to protect
		      me - please do but get Daria safe before that...

		      <br>
		      not sure what to call this...an update? an
		      explanation...well whatever it is, the thing
		      is that last month i decided to make these
		      notes wait until the song was released, which
		      i expected to be a matter of days or a week...
		      there are several many dreams on the backlog...
		      but maybe this will help me make it all more
		      concise...still, i don't want anyone thinking
		      that i have been putting the dreamweaver page
		      on the backburner...on the offchance that
		      new visitors arrive or that i have upset
		      followers, i am put-placing the earlier notes
		      back in some sort of extra html box...meanwhile,
		      i still expect the track to be released any minute
		      now...i am reading charlotte bronte's villete,
		      i had more of a party than i expected with charles
		      bukowski's hollywood...nearly as lavish as pulp,
		      now i am in the middle of a cheesy slasher ride
		      called graduation day - this after viewing
		      red sun and wondering who would find the sword
		      left hanging there on the train wires...i think
		      i have entered into the veritas guitar giveaway
		      and i will be beside myself if i happen to win -
		      hmm i was thinking about love letters from a portuguese
		      nun as i wondered why it had such an impact on me...i couldn't
		      figure it out, as i looked at it again everyone seemed
		      to differ from my recollection but i saw why or partly
		      why kia attracted me...there is a similarity between
		      her and susan hemingway...it was then that robyn disappeared
		      and i viewed ballerina which i felt was too much into
		      developing the backstory and training only to be clumsy
		      but it came through in the end with some help from
		      keanu and a flamethrower...being maria was extremely
		      hard to get through, as i think highly of LTIP yet
		      this never gives you a way to care for ms schneider - 
		      the element of spoiled brat never leaves...despite
		      the stories, she and brando remained friends although
		      it is true that the same cannot be said for bertolucci -
		      you see there is no way to win, obviously i can't dismiss
		      a woman's suffering but i cannot badmouth bertolucci as
		      the only director that ever mailed me directly as if 
		      i were on his level...well, some situations have no
		      distinct resolution...let's see i also took a look at
		      meghan 2.0 but the wonder of the first has worn off in 
		      this sequel - didn't they see the fabulous potential
		      of the opening story with an ai model gone beserk...
		      dude, that was the movie and then end it with the 
		      promise of meghan being re-built for a third film...well,
		      it didnt leave a bad taste yet mostly that's the way i
		      saw it...like they threw everything at the audience hoping
		      something would stick...finally, cold sweat was all right
		      but here too they purposely posed the little girl to 
		      give men upskirt panty shots...no reason at all unless there 
		      is something about bastille day they haven't told me...
		      yeah, dream notes will return when the song is out.

				  9 august 2025
		     the fifth of july was released on the eighth of august, i was
				  immersed in establishing a balance in terms of of music
				  software that is to say uninstalling this and installing
				  that...mostly this involved native instruments...it felt
				  as if had been suddenly rewarded for my efforts which 
				  was an all nighter that went past noon given that the
				  second laptop requested an update that was slow and 
				  resulted in me foolishly deleting the onedrive documents
				  folder which turned out to be the actual and only document
				  container...it wasnt in the live trash to restore and it
				  seems to have took the restore points too...so there was
				  the matter to checklist the missing things and get as many 
				  back as possible except i don't know what was there exactly
				  or why it took up so much space since i only use that for music -
				  reminds me to double check if anything else needs to be put placed
				  therein again...in any case, i felt good and sensed it as a turning
				  point although part of me wished to go back to typewriters
				  and tape recorders...in my dream there was some sort of 
				  discussion, could some beds be countries...the other afternoon
				  i awoke to a vision of a chinese letter or note which dissolved
				  into dots as if translated morse code...i say it is a vision since
				  it was there at the moment i awoke and vanished while i got up -
				  daria returned from sicily and wore a revealing red dress, i was
				  pretty surprised when she said she was switching schools as she
				  counted her shoes...i freaked out over julia presenting her
				  neighbor as a best friend while worried that it would in turn
				  give my own next door upstairs or downstairs an entrance...
				  ironically i have never felt so attracted to the other julia...
				  well lets get irony out of the way - lotta said she broke up
				  with someone that she had gone to mallorca and taken home...
				  i hesitate to spell out my suspicion that is was her manager,
				  but it is only logical to consider being that she specificied
				  him as a companion during her first trip to france...i sensed
				  it then but there may be more to the story than meets the eye
				  and it is nobody's business, i only mention it in passing to 
				  show myself how foolish i can still be...but what will i do
				  with these feelings and these memorized imprints within the
				  mind's eye...germany suspends military aid to israel...alaska
				  takes center stage...i realize that having a lot of guitars
				  also brings the dilemma of which one to play...agency heads
				  perish, stella then william, for a minute, as i glanced at
				  writings and songs i thought to myself i've overdone it, i've
				  taken on too much...yet it is an age of excess, is it not? 
				  i'm nearing chapter twenty of villette and i like it thus
				  far - i started to view harvest yet i realized that i was too
				  distracted and tired and hopefully can give it the attention it
				  deserves today...i'm happy to return here for these erratic
				  notes and i have a hell of ghost story for you next time...
				  <br>
				  <br>
				  18/08
				  <br>
				  <br>
				  i do not feel myself to be a stranger to ghosts...at least
				  not in dreams...i have felt their visits like angels on
				  parole from heaven's jail...here you go, take a few minutes
				  for the living...ever since i started writing i thought of
				  the words are we dead that live to tell, i thought also of
				  fame is the sun that shines on the dead, well i thought of
				  many things but these in relation to that...in any case, 
				  it's nothing i can prove, what proof is there within the
				  unconsciousness...only the shadows within memory...in the
				  case of my uncle, i would amend the statement to be from
				  hell's confines or perhpas via purgatory's expiation, do
				  a good deed and we'll let you go home, as it were...
				  i don't think the church kept that middle ground it's
				  weird that it comes to mind on the heels of the hand of dante,
				  who ofcourse included it in his divine comedy - 
				  where was i well i was stopped thrice at returning here,
				  first the subject matter - in this occasion it wasnt a
				  member of the family, it was someone i employed...i saw
				  him for the last time on the street, circa 108 or 109
				  broadway, he remarked about my countenance as if surprised,
				  i didn't know what to say and said it was plastic surgery -
				  in fact thinking of Elvis who i had heard say to get it
				  early so it wouldnt have to be so drastic et cetera...
				  listening to undescribably blue a dozen times yesterday
				  after the anniversary of his death...he'd gotten a bit
				  crude in a car as the documentary rolled, i think now,
				  so somehow this all fits together as in the dream it was
				  a car, the centerpiece was a car - unlike my dream last
				  night of leah telling me we were friends and then awaking 
				  to think it was bentley whi i had suggested be considered
				  to play sinead although she is neither an actor or singer
				  yet you can't look at her and not see the resemblance
				  once it's pointed out...in that dream i think he pointed at
				  the car, i was with a girl, not sure who - he was with another,
				  i put my girl in the back seat and got in the front seat - 
				  then he got into the driver's seat with his girl sort of upon him
				  but they kept shifting and sexually so until he ejaculated on 
				  her face yet all the while looking at me in the end with 
				  some sort of cruel satisfaction i could not understand as i
				  awoke...a precise memory of something he had told me led me
				  to believe that it was a ghost, no imagination or product of
				  mind, miller and aspirin, this was his recipe to last longer
				  during intercourse...you load up on miller high life beer
				  and get a couple of aspirin...subsequently i wondered if
				  ghosts actually had sex in the afterlife, they never really
				  frighten me and this was no different in that sense but it 
				  sure was intense and i sort of wish i knew what it meant...
				  i thought about it briefly again while watching the very
				  strange the night always comes...mazda madness...eddington
				  shows us the madness created at the start of the pandemic -
				  i recalled my argument that there was no logic to it, 
				  like prohibiting driving so there'd be no accidents...
				  because even walking one might stumble and fall...
				  ah yes, i was shocked to see walk hard the dewey cox
				  story...but i will refrain from commentizing upon it -
				  as i will remain silent on harvest, which is in a class
				  of its own. now then, or secondly, i was stopped by the
				  awful feeling of the delay fact...my spirits, high in
				  expectation of a haul that should have been arriving,
				  were brought down low as the package was sent out a week
				  later than i thought...so all that won't be here until
				  next week...look at my very own first world problem!
				  and finally well thirdly, i was stopped by the insight
				  in a passage within villete, i imagine very few people
				  will comprehend but it contains a severe truth and
				  that along with the fact that the novel might have
				  peaked in the middle gave me pause; yes i know it
				  is a long passage, but i must put-place it here
				  so as to have it available...
				  from chapter 24;
				  "Those who live in retirement, whose lives have fallen amid the seclusion of schools 
				  or of other walled-in and guarded dwellings, are liable to be suddenly and for a long 
				  while dropped out of the memory of their friends, the denizens of a freer world. 
				  Unaccountably, perhaps, and close upon some space of unusually frequent intercourse⁠—some 
				  congeries of rather exciting little circumstances, whose natural sequel would rather seem
				  to be the quickening than the suspension of communication⁠—there falls a stilly pause,
				  a wordless silence, a long blank of oblivion. Unbroken always is this blank; alike entire
				  and unexplained. The letter, the message once frequent, are cut off; the visit, formerly
				  periodical, ceases to occur; the book, paper, or other token that indicated remembrance, comes no more.

Always there are excellent reasons for these lapses, if the hermit but knew them. Though he is stagnant in his 
				  cell, his connections without are whirling in the very vortex of life. That void interval 
				  which passes for him so slowly that the very clocks seem at a stand, and the wingless hours 
				  plod by in the likeness of tired tramps prone to rest at milestones⁠—that same interval, 
				  perhaps, teems with events, and pants with hurry for his friends.

The hermit⁠—if he be a sensible hermit⁠—will swallow his own thoughts, and lock up his own emotions during these
				  weeks of inward winter. He will know that Destiny designed him to imitate, on occasion, the 
				  dormouse, and he will be conformable: make a tidy ball of himself, creep into a hole of life’s
				  wall, and submit decently to the drift which blows in and soon blocks him up, preserving him in ice for the season.

Let him say, “It is quite right: it ought to be so, since so it is.” And, perhaps, one day his snow-sepulchre will open,
				  spring’s softness will return, the sun and south-wind will reach him; the budding of hedges, 
				  and carolling of birds, and singing of liberated streams, will call him to kindly resurrection.
				  Perhaps this may be the case, perhaps not: the frost may get into his heart and never thaw more; 
				  when spring comes, a crow or a pie may pick out of the wall only his dormouse-bones. Well,
				  even in that case, all will be right: it is to be supposed he knew from the first he was mortal, 
				  and must one day go the way of all flesh, “As well soon as syne.”

Following that eventful evening at the theatre, came for me seven weeks as bare as seven sheets of blank paper: 
				  no word was written on one of them; not a visit, not a token.

About the middle of that time I entertained fancies that something had happened to my friends at La Terrasse. 
				  The mid-blank is always a beclouded point for the solitary: his nerves ache with the strain of long expectancy; 
				  the doubts hitherto repelled gather now to a mass and⁠—strong in accumulation⁠—roll back upon him with a force
				  which savours of vindictiveness. Night, too, becomes an unkindly time, and sleep and his nature cannot agree:
				  strange starts and struggles harass his couch; the sinister band of bad dreams, with horror of calamity,
				  and sick dread of entire desertion at their head, join the league against him. Poor wretch! 
				  He does his best to bear up, but he is a poor, pallid, wasting wretch, despite that best."

				  well, yes these are the lyrics to nobody knows you when you're down and out - 
				  which is possibly a point charlotte missed...but there were no blues back then...
				  still, to think she could - by turning her character into a man with poetic
				  intersections describing a solitary existence - conjure those emotions
				  by put-placing seven weeks as the timeline...herself, always surrounded
				  by others and eventually even married, was not intimate with loneliness
				  in the sense of lacking company...still, like the words in i'm just a
				  gigolo, there's something to it, you might agree...i certainly do, having
				  spent much more time than seven weeks without companionship...my point is
				  then what would she pen if she imagined it to be seven months, or years...
				  in my dream helena is in an involved conversation...i'm hearing her yet
				  i am not sure if i am there with her or not...the only way i can describe
				  it is to say i had no peripheral vision, my eyes were locked in looking
				  ahead into nothing specific or a specific nothingness...an abstraction -
				  she was speaking of legacy as if a time travel spy, for a minute i thought
				  it was to let me know what would become of my writing but i was either
				  too horny or more likely sure that it would be just like it should and
				  didn't want a fortune teller as it were...i should interrupt myself
				  and interject briefly on how once in a while women will contact me
				  -usually to join a dating site, or more frequently with a provocative photo
				  and a note stating how they need or want this or that in random succession,
				  spam as it were that i barely glance of or take notice, less frequently
				  it is an actual letter with convoluted details form european women
				  intent on what they call a serious relationship, then there are a few
				  requests to chat...since these are few i do answer as i sometimes politely
				  turn down the others...early in the month a woman named mary started to message.
				  it was, to my surprise, nearly normal with none of the usual weirdness that
				  i have pointed to here - of course this was balanced by her wanting me
				  to invest in future trading...still it all felt friendly and maybe well
				  intentioned until i noticed her reluctance to be 'seen' in terms of
				  me posting her picture...and when her voice didnt match her features, 
				  she claimed she had lived overseas when young and so on and so forth -
				  well i suppose i will never know as she then disappeared for a while
				  only to return for a final confrontation in which she turned logic on 
				  its very head by deleting the thread and calling me an extreme pervert!
				  a good title for something i suppose, now i don't know what she meant
				  but i am positive she was hiding something...i was talking about hair
				  styles and shaved heads...still it brought the lonesome side of things
				  into focus...so i'm saying to myself, am i even able to have a conversation
				  with someone else...can i even afford a friend...but worse, and i don't
				  like to admit it, is it now so settled in me, this luxury this freedom
				  of being by myself that i cannot in a sense share in terms of companionship.
				  i seem to be able to do so with my cat and my guitars yet i don't know. 
				  my one concern is that by divulging or declassifying such notions, is
				  that it will sound as if a protest. it ain't, it's merely a fact with
				  a bit of an opinion that is maybe grounding its roots or being pulled
				  from its place to be replanted on more solid land.

				  twenty august<br>
				  <br>
				  <br>
				  on of the last times i turned on my television was to gawk
				  at would be the next to last mission impossible film - gee
				  that was an awful good time...so i had some expectations
				  with the conclusion of this series...after setting up the
				  sony, i settled in to it...however i found i had no way 
				  of pausing due to the cable remote being for functions
				  unralted to the usb drive and the natural remote itself
				  unresponsive to new batteries and slaps...already it was
				  a mission in itself as i then downloaded andraid apps
				  that all failed since lacking the ir blaster as they 
				  call it...giving up an turning to one of the laptops,
				  i found a much clearer picture, at least...but i was a
				  bit distracted given the aforementioned runaround - 
				  and then the underwater scenes battled with james 
				  bond scenes in memory as did the high flying sequences
				  near the end find themselves contrasted with hell's angels -
				  i mean i knew i was looking at very rare and special cinema
				  history but films for me an experience that require a
				  preset disposition, that is to say simply the agreement
				  within one;s self to go watch a movie...in fact my idea
				  was the opposite as i wanted to finish up villette, yet
				  sensing opportunity well...let us say i did not like it
				  as much as the other one yet there is no doubt that it
				  is awe inspiring. it also bitter sweet, as nothing in
				  production will wield such raw power for an incredible
				  cross section of people...in any casem does one buy a 
				  new remote or overhaul the equipment entirely...
				  in my dream, i am sitting with some girls, it is a restaurant,
				  a rare dream for me...but i am sitting there like a thief
				  planning on how to carry all the things i plan to steal...
				  i got up at midnight, feeling weird over it and not even
				  sure where it was or who they were...in the mary timeline,
				  i will have you know, there was another catfish, i say this
				  now certain of who the actual woman in the photo is...
				  someone named rose, who must be insane or intent on making
				  me feel as if crazed...no need to extend the story as it
				  might serve itself better in terms of fiction...no way it
				  could be poetry...i went to sleep for a few more hours
				  hoping i would catch my new contact in hong kong before 
				  nightfall...you know, the twelve hour time zone difference -
				  speaking of hours, i'm only a few away from concluding
				  villette, at dawn i cooked rice and made the chicken
				  peppery with onion, lime, and olive oil. the meal brought
				  a drowsy sensation i fought off not wanting to spoil 
				  the gains i made in terms of my desired schedule.
				  i hesitated through coffee and cigarettes yet jotted
				  these words hoping to get even more done in the sense
				  of recording or mixing music for production.

				  minute wherein nothing else was on, a final
				  concert that really was saintly and an army
				  of guitarists picking on momma i'm coming home,
				  someone postulated that it was a zeitgeist!
				  myself, i was puzzled. i thought of the scene

				  to lick the tiles, this ain't saying i didn't
				  like the man - i did, i only felt that the hype
				  was indeed somehow out of tune...too much or
				  not enough? i can't say, it's the emotion i 
				  suppose that one might encounter if most of 
				  us looked the other way while the war pigs 
				  went about their business, by the way, it's
				  a protest song in the folk sense...now you 
				  might ask what i think it should have been
				  like or expected...i reckon something more
				  underground, something in keeping with his
				  persona or style...who the fuck is justin 
				  bieber, the wynn hotel is asking...yeah, something
				  that didnt parade in a procession so heavy
				  that it hardly left a trace...or did everyone
				  hail satan as if not knowing shit about fuck...
				  have i got too vulgar, good he would have enjoyed
				  that, a twenty something couple having condomed
				  sex decide to go for a get pregnant try and proceed
				  to turn the rubber inside out after ejaculation
				  as the romp continues or perhaps it was Jesus 
				  gone insane from prayers
				  to john michael osbourne, rest in metal.
				  meanwhile we have not found cile steward, 
				  her mother, with the strength of God, voiced
				  her sorrow in a solemn attempt to make the 
				  world safer for other children in the future...
				  i dedicate whatever this might be to cece,
				  i demand that senate bill one be put into action...
				  i decline the silence for now and so have here said...
				  (for a second there i wish i had been the candy man
				  instead, separating the sorrow and collecting
				  all the cream, of course that entertainer was a card carrying 
				  member of the church of satan, not the deranged
				  seeing eye bitch hound in everything is illuminated)

				  23 august 2025
				  <br>
				  i came to the end of villette and therein knew
				  i was right, the quoted passage was the peak,
				  in a sense, it foreshadows the possibly solitary
				  life to come after the sails encountered a storm...
				  i awoke very early - too early - i knew i had
				  not rested although surely i had slept a few 
				  hours...only a few, i always think of soraya on
				  this date...i raced through some likes on her
				  instagram as if to say hey - i didn;t really
				  enjoy f-1 the movie...i even thought, no wonder
				  apple tv is raising its price, the soundtrack alone
				  must have cost a fortune...and yet it fades out
				  with a mediocre ed sheerhan tune...let me not argue
				  about it - obviously some people like his thing...
				  my point is the shifting perspective used to film
				  the laps did not make sense to me...i also did not
				  like ferrari, but for contrast you can feel the 
				  quality is higher especially in the stranger killing
				  crash scene...anyway, we are behind the car, then 
				  in front of the car, but also sometimes on the side
				  of it...dizzying and if like me you are not a fan
				  of the sport - well...it makes it a struggle...
				  i regret to report, as i searched for what to 
				  read next, leaning into the tenant of wildfell hall,
				  so as to have experienced all three of the bronte 
				  sister's writing albeit i believe wuthering heights
				  to be the bee's knees, i thought of london rules,
				  which i excitedly read in vigil for the arrival of
				  a new season of slow horses...i thought if charlotte
				  were writing today this would be her type of romp,
				  hmm perhaps without the political commentary, herron
				  goes out of his way to have a giggle at trump's expense,
				  but there is hardly a mention of leaders in villette,
				  well napoleon as a point of reference or description...
				  in any case i have decided what to read next, although
				  i am most likely going to view einee meniee...in my
				  dream i was in the lobby of where i used to live
				  once upon a time, about to check the mail, i looked
				  at the key, it now had to be slid in sideways, as
				  opposed to straight in...as if to reflect my thoughts
				  before going to sleep - people i don't especially like
				  showed up - i awoke weirded out - who knows why this
				  happens and who knows why my thoughts turn to women 
				  once in recent while as if camping 
				  i am certain want nothing to do with me...like is it 
				  a message, or is it merely a mess? i scrambled eggs
				  and then started the day again near noon...it's 
				  an unusal day as did dishes and even cooked again,
				  yet i am waiting a while before settling into the
				  meal. oh yeah and the movie...
				  <br>
				  <br>
				  24/8/2025
				  <br>
				  so the movie, not terribly good, had, i felt, car
				  sequences that somehow surpassed the F-1 scenes...
				  still, i can only imagine they made that thinking
				  it would be some sort of shocking treat but the 
				  sad part is none of it stands the test of time,
				  (someone asked chatgpt to count to a million)
				  and i am writing this mere hours after watching it!
				  sure i remember and can recall it, but not in the
				  sweet way that happens when cinema rises to its
				  potential without gimmicks...(the ai refused,
				  several times) i want to express my admiration
				  for brad pitt so my previous thoughts are not
				  taken as a stance against him...this was jack
				  conrad, after all, not to mention being the
				  producer of mickey 17, anyway let's hang our
				  hopes on cliff booth...both my dreams were 
				  weird, i finally sort of met another gemma, 
				  well a third if we are counting ward, and
				  she, not the heir or the model, were in my
				  dream yet in some vague fashion i cannot pinpoint -
				  it crawled through the day, i remember standing in
				  the shower thinking, i am in arizona and nevada
				  and london somehow...helena called her chickens
				  baby dinosaurs...i was dealing with some other
				  woman in my dream, she was handing me paperwork
				  that needed to be filled out but then some disgruntled
				  man switched places with her and i stood at the counter
				  trying to ask about the last two forms...there were
				  paragraph length questions, i wanted to know where i 
				  was supposed to write the answers...i suppose this
				  was an improvement on the baffling situation with 
				  savannah...i liked her, i think she didnt like me
				  yet overwhelmed thought's vision as if it had all been
				  reversed within me - which might help to explain part
				  of yesterday;s note...it was getting hot as i awoke
				  today, there in the sauna type humid chamber which i 
				  cannot fathom since i long ago covered the windows
				  against the sun...so middle night get up feeling a
				  severe twist at left calf like a sprain or swimming
				  cramp...i sit up and it;s gone, i lay back down but
				  no longer feel like staying in bed possibly sensing
				  the mysteriously burning miasma...it's sunday, there
				  was a song being wroted in my head or at least the
				  repeated refrain of it insisting...years ago i wroted
				  'we are your limousine salesmen' it reminds me of that
				  of course someone removed those pages from songbook
				  as if now reflected in waking minutes - emily ann
				  roberts, i find, had to get her martin and video
				  letter the tune she was thinking of...flight to 
				  wisconsin...madison's a nice place, not as nice as
				  madison avenue yet that is to be expected, no surprise,
				  sunrise yet a few hours away as i speak to someone
				  in hong kong, maybe victoria; name of land, 
				  ceded to England by China in 1842, from the Chinese 
				  hiang kiang, meaning good water; after the english queen.
                  even in such a faraway, at such distances, i encounter
				  the sensation of posers intent on masking themselves
				  for the sabotage, making the entity in mission impossible
				  more likely than i would care to admit - is it others
				  i do not trust or myself...there is no answer, in the
				  proximity a headlighted car stands still at the corner
				  as if deciding which way to turn at these crossroads -
				  i catch a glimpse as i look out the window to question
				  the delay in my request for breeze - the weather is
				  getting cooler but it will never be winter here. 
				  Lucy, in the novel, is the only Snow i will encounter
				  for now.

				  26 august<br>
				  <br>
				  couldn't find a way to record correctly with video,
				  until i did, but my project idea is going to take
				  longer as now doing it twice means double the work
				  in terms of editing...oh yeah, i am simply trying
				  to get a few versions together for something...
				  it's tuesday at two in the morning - on monday i 
				  dreamt i was with julia - she was also in a magazine,
				  the magazine was rolled with a viriddescent tint as
				  if stained by grass on dream lawn...i can't say why
				  there is such ease with some people in these scenes,
				  like her...still i was looking at the magazine more
				  so than at her...when i awoke i found liberty had
				  visited a magazine shop...i didnt see liroe - 
				  i used the mustang and the kramer all in the same
				  reel - one take has a good enough sound and the
				  other has a nice enough angle, putting these together
				  is a task that worries me, so i have been putting it off -
				  i went to sleep early and awoke too soon for my taste -
				  i had been dreaming of emilee, maybe because i kept the
				  portrait up on my wall and it is partly visible in the
				  video, or maybe for no specific reason at all - it was
				  not our life, at least not one that either of us imagined;
				  we were living on a farm, in a farm house, and she asked me
				  to get her something yet as i went out i realized that i
				  had left my keys, it seems that in the dream knocking on 
				  the door was not an option - i had what she wanted and 
				  was surrounded by birds - i think now of how most birds 
				  are natural cannibals - in any case the bizarre part was
				  how the idea of living with her felt memorized, ritualized,
				  as if a fact in memory although recently i have only thought
				  of her at the sight of willow hand, i wake up with the 
				  heat strangling me, jump in the shower thinking of
				  romy mars, she had lightly pranked her roommate in a
				  lockout situation, as for the rest of the situation;
				  i survived the struggle to watch electrick children -
				  maybe i was rewatching it, can;t exactly count all the
				  movies i;ve seen...so i either liked it better this time
				  or i enjoyed it for the first time...hanging on the telephone
				  is as catchy as ego...still haven't selected what book to 
				  look into next...on a whim, i viewed the assignment, which
				  i know for certain i did see long ago but had no detailed
				  memory of - it's not an easy one to look at and perhaps 
				  more so now in the middle of mourning donald southerland -
				  i had lost track of aidan circa practical magic or more
				  likely songcatcher - good to see he has been constantly
				  at work with five projects upcoming and one series...
				  making my production concerns feel trivial...hate to 
				  see lars von trier's name kicked around the obituary
				  circuit, it was per holst and i suppose to attract 
				  more readers the press made the connection...my
				  point is the man has enough trouble without having
				  to now navigate against the casual curse of
				  words in print which might have made some people
				  think it was his headline instead of the producer. 
				  "The old cathedrals often have sublime artworks
				  hidden away in the darkest corners for only God to see. 
				  The same goes for murder..." 
				  <br>
				  <br>
				  28/8
				  <br>
				  not much in terms of dreams...i chalk it up to 
				  overthinking...that film led me on to want to 
				  fiddle through a spy thriller...i selected the
				  fourth protocol, in an audio book i think is
				  an abridged version - i also think there is 
				  a film adaptation...in any case, it is pretty 
				  good...got halfway into it and didn't want to
				  to stop...i cannot say the same for mobland -
				  which i lined up to view then weighed the 
				  things to do...hopefully i can see that
				  down the line...i did take a moment to view
				  the deceiver which holds up shockingly well -
				  i don't mind nudity in cinema but i love it
				  when it could have obviously been used yet
				  isn't...like it implies a certain respect 
				  for the actors, specifically the actress -
				  (the lead plays a prostitute, you see_
				  well, as for my own video project, i have now
				  neared the finish line...if all goes well i 
				  can count it as a completion by tomorrow...
				  it took more work than i expected but i 
				  suppose that is the nature of it...
				  i am going ahead with the ending although
				  there was something in the box still in transit
				  that i wanted to employ therein...the last i 
				  heard it should arrive this weekend and be 
				  delivered some days after that...september.
				  the thought saddens me yet it is not such
				  a serious sorrow - i mean the haul will 
				  positively improve my spirits. she rides
				  shotgun thrilled me with its well paced
				  and mysterious start then further as it
				  took its twists and turns...indeed, one
				  i might not hesitate to watch again...
				  lovely surprise. ps, writer tries to 
				  order chinese food, they respond, we 
				  are out of fried rice, baffled - he 
				  settles for a sandwich...the next day
				  he tries again...we took beef fried
				  rice off the menu but you can order the
				  mixed fried rice with only beef...i 
				  ordered it...still baffled and maybe
				  even more now in writing it as the 
				  frivolity prevails over logic and i 
				  think it doesn't even make a good story!
				  my apologies for put-placing such 
				  a jigsaw puzzle in your hands, hopefully
				  i will make it up to you with some other
				  tidbit which requires no guessing
				  in the coming month.

				  two september
				  <br>
				  <br>
				  having finished my attempts at recording
				  nine versions of get behind the mule,
				  live and on video, with even a couple of 
				  takes i like very much, i turned down
				  two german films which were - well - they
				  were feeling out of place - and went 
				  straight into mobland...i actually could
				  not stop watching it, i kept thinking this
				  should have been two movies, maybe three -
				  so i watched it all except for the last
				  half hour to have the pleasure of waking
				  up to it as a sort of conclusion. so happy,
				  i went down that road. in my dreams i saw
				  pigeons on a city street - my thoughts 
				  convoluted and quick - i had started reading
				  the tenant of wildfell hall and maybe i was
				  trying to hard to process the information -
				  i don't think i've dreamt of rock doves
				  previously - i also don't think i have posted
				  a series without any notes...there was some 
				  sort of glitch and i had to re-post it and
				  so continued posting all nine without notes -
				  i suppose it's obvious but i had promised 
				  willow hand (who is featured in the eighth
				  version - actually the first one i taped
				  which served like a catalyst - cause i 
				  was tickled by her picture with a donkey -
				  near enough to a mule, i thought...
				  when a donkey gets it on with a mare;
				  mules are produced...or so i am told)
				  a credit in the form of mentioning it was
				  her...well, at least i am making it clear
				  here and might edit maybe or commentize it...
				  in my back to bed dream this morning i found
				  my cat was golden on one side and there was
				  another cat seemingly excited, feline erection
				  dream on keanu reeves' birthday...i had been
				  thinking of helena who said her cat is willy
				  and made an amazing road car video which 
				  made me think of amanda seyfried...you'll
				  know the refernce if you've seen twin peaks
				  the return...for some reason i was very excited
				  to hear that chloe grace moretz had tied the
				  proverbial knot...there was a pale blue dress
				  and i loved seeing her joy in it...
				  however my yesterday still went weird as i 
				  didn't get to new recordings, not even to 
				  guitar ritual...it was like i was overwhelmed
				  by my own thoughts in the whirlwind puzzle of
				  procrastination or more likely too much talk.
				  <br>
				  <br>
				  later that evening<br>
				  <br>
				  <br>
				  i suppose it is what i would call the variation
				  sessions...i was at ease with the song since
				  doing it daily as an improvisation...of course
				  once one hits the record button, with the knowledge
				  that it all has to be done in one take...well, let
				  us say most of them were not first takes, all the first
				  takes served to figure out the style (except for an 
				  unfilmed one wherein i wasn't thinking about it in
				  those terms - only to get a feel or confirm that i
				  was hearing myself right...)all i knew
				  was that there should be some difference between
				  each...the heat and humidity didn't help and i 
				  admit to some surprise at the end of each completion -
				  i am inclined to say i like the fifth version a bit
				  more than the others...for now...before that, as
				  i tried to recapture the planned progression in 
				  open F tuning on the martin acoustic, the high e string 
				  snapped - i mention this because later with ibanez
				  electric (in open G) the situation repeated itself...
				  i realized later that these two had become connected
				  in ways i didn't imagine, they were used to being
				  the only ones i used...and suddenly surrounded by
				  the new models it seems they collaborated to mirror
				  each other's protest...it led me to rearrange how
				  i kept them and put placed them together hoping that
				  it would help in the future...still, it underlines
				  the struggle of having several guitars as any of 
				  the axes might at one time or another feel neglected...
				  it's nothing i expected...like the new naked gun...
				  what a riot! it was beyond silly right down to the 
				  creadts, you don't need glasses! well, i do need
				  guesses about the two dreams i had, again in 3k,
				  therein at the living room - both times with an
				  ex girlfriend and her sister - once her memory 
				  flooded my thoughts but not the other...the way
				  to describe it would be sensible...we spoke calmly,
				  lovingly maybe, and in hushed tones - i can't say 
				  more because the content of the conversations 
				  drifted away leaving only the hint of itself. my 
				  only concern was that i sensed no emotional shift
				  within myself over them as if they were interchangeable -
				  i hope they are all right and wish them well -
				  after calculating and contrasting the price of pizza
				  and cake, i opted for cake and said thing arrived an
				  hour or so ago...i had some and shaved. anyway, the songs
				  were all recorded live during the period of 26 august
				  until 29 august with the exception of the one not filmed
				  from 20 august but also done live in a single take -
				  which felt no stage fright worry over a possible audience...
				  the sun was in virgo and once in a while i felt bathed
				  in that light. 
				  <br>
				  <br>
				  4.9.2025
				  <br>
				  the expected haul seems to have been re-delayed...they
				  said it would arrive friday, tomorrow, but that implies
				  another week's wait since those things need to be sorted,
				  put on trucks, and so on and so forth...
				  i was partly alarmed by the witch's torment as it held
				  an interesting concept yet insisted on playing out as
				  if it couldn't have been done in an hour or less -
				  for me, that meant skipping through it to its uneventful
				  ending...there was indeed more drama in the windows 
				  update...i'd seen the reports and noticed all the wild
				  discounts which in retrospect feel as if a planned revolution
				  to switch as much equipment as possible - with some hesitation
				  i went ahead and updated, confident in my snapdragon but
				  once the package downloaded the machine returned with that
				  message; ran into a problem and needs to restart...it said
				  they would restart it but i got jittery after some minutes
				  and pressed down on the power button feeling all the madness
				  that comes with possibly losing files one has even forgot
				  one had...as i waited i made a mental list of the novel
				  i thought was not backed up and the songs that only existed
				  therein, and who knows what else...funny huh, and i had just
				  started learning the chords to lennon's i'm losing you -
				  also therein shocked by the line "So what the hell am I supposed to do?
                   Just put a bandaid on it? And stop the bleeding now..."
				  which needless to say brought to mind the tragic 1980 scene
				  and suddenly my own situation with the laptop...anyway,
				  all that did pass, it started up and i paused updates...
				  with a plan to connect one of my storage units and transfer
				  as much as possible in case of anything similar down the line.
				  he repeats that line, stop the bleeding now...i thought it
				  must have crossed his mind as he lay shot down...
				  meanwhile i wasn't bleeding but the sweat felt like losing
				  part of myself upon the bed - two hours of dreamless sleep
				  only to awake to the wonder of it all - returning to 
				  dream, i find myself dressed as i was except with shirt
				  unbuttoned and running around trying to fetch a pen and
				  respond to the door all at the same time...i'm standing
				  there as if waiting to sign something...there are two men
				  at the gate, they look as if one man that has grown a
				  second head on top of his natural skull...they are dark,
				  unfriendly, and i cannot recognize them...i wake up again
				  thankful that at least i had another hour of sleep - 
				  i recorded an instrumental song yesterday and no one
				  knocked upon my door - except for a meal delivery -
				  the day was cooler yet the apartment kept it;s steamy
				  stance...i thought about helena's voice message before
				  going to sleep...i think it is incorrect to leave school
				  in order to be more of a fashion model...but that is
				  only a suspicion as i have no insight...when i got up 
				  it was eight thirty i didn't have any dream recall. 
				  <br>
				  <br>
				  five september<br>
				  <br>
				  <br>
				  my point was that she could exploit herself in 
				  terms of becoming a social media influencer slash
				  model instead of paying an agency to exploit her
				  by passing her portfolio along for adverts...
				  the education part is debatable...
				  i watched dynamite, a film i had superimposed 
				  in part - the party scene - upon one of the get
				  behind the mule takes...it was way more intense
				  than i could have imagined...but as a sort of 
				  spoiler warning, skip this one if you are a 
				  bird lover...julia faye was in it like she was
				  in a lot of cecil b demille films...i didn't
				  make a movie yesterday, but julia mecey was
				  in my dream...we were sitting next to each other
				  at the frame of an open door, i felt dumb for
				  not knowing the architectual terminology of
				  a rounded door...it was very much like the 
				  door in rome when i met carmen from romania
				  and took her picture...suddenly marie anne
				  was sitting opposite us...none of us were 
				  speaking as if we understood one another
				  by simply being there - i woke up for a moment
				  then, i had been looking at her ring...studying
				  it to find a talk show host engraved on one side -
				  it must have been the middle of the night when
				  my next dream presented masha which is spelled
				  like mawa but is a nickname for maria, i say 
				  masha to distinguish from aria and neverova -
				  masha had been on my mind through the day as 
				  she reminds me of someone i can't place - or 
				  perhaps it is merely someone from a past life -
				  in the dream i am still audience and she is
				  decked out in heels and a cat print bikini -
				  she is swaying more than dancing but i can't
				  make sense of the dream and awake a bit baffled
				  like maybe this scene was intended for someone
				  else -it's still dark yet the day is coming
				  fast - i have some cake along with the coffee
				  and get in a chapter of the tenant of wildfell
				  hall...i steal away for a nap before the sun 
				  gets any higher into the sky - in the sugar
				  filled dreamscape i am on a sofa facing a tv
				  and there is a girl there with me...i brush away
				  remnants of clingy socks from her toes...like
				  always there is nothing on the tv, i play with her
				  breast and try for one of the music stations - i
				  am surprised - it wasn't like before as all the 
				  music channels are labeled by country yet no 
				  matter the nation there is an ozzy osbourne song
				  blasting out on each...i lower the volume and
				  realize three women from my family are arriving -
				  i guess it was lotta or sierra - i'm really not
				  sure as i have not televisioned since mother 
				  was here a year or so ago - she tells me to get
				  her my sister's phone number - i stand in front
				  of my sister in the dream and notice a spider web
				  tattoo on her right eyelid...she says she can't
				  remember that number number and vanishes while i
				  now face a closet of my onw clothes - sierra or
				  lotta says something about the spider web design -
				  i sense mother and aunt but i can't see them, then
				  start to doubt that it was my sister...it would 
				  necessarily take a larger face for that design,
				  maybe it was all a masquerade or the dream of
				  a couch potato somewhere - i don't know but i did
				  play i'm losing you again a couple of times and
				  even took a minute to feel the vocal, that is mine
				  in contrast to lennon...i suspect i will only have
				  trouble with the chorus which goes a bit against
				  the grain as if to plead lighter than the argumentative
				  verses in four syllables that sometimes sound like three -
				  not that i actually know how i will do it in the end,
				  but i wanted get learnt on how he did it.
				  <br>
				  <br>
				  six september<br>
				  <br>
				  <br>
				  someone is speaking to me in a dream, i do not
				  know or recognize who it might be...it seems we
				  are in a lobby or shop...something street-level
				  since after talking i find myself on the avenue...
				  i am shown pepperidge farm chessmen cookies - 
				  there is writing upon the package more like a 
				  letter or note than ingredients...i actually
				  have one in the pantry yet i had overdosed on
				  these sweets and it's been there a couple of months
				  now - the font is a light script - easy enough to 
				  read yet i don't recall what it said - upon waking
				  i find myself thinking of astrid, i had just learnt
				  she was in lisbon when the following day told of 
				  a streetcar all the press called a funicular for
				  some reason...she has two pictures are i admire -
				  i was relieved to see her post a new photo as it
				  then stood to reason that she was more or less in
				  safety - in the dream, i saunter and spot a man
				  i do recognize although i have not met him - i 
				  suppose he reminds me of the jamaican in the 
				  exchange loft with the slide out key as a transaction
				  counter - for some reason in the scene he is having a
				  sale, the dime bag comes with some sort of hallucinogenic
				  side-kick, twisted roots in licorish color resembling 
				  peppermint christmas candy sticks or canes in surreal
				  or abstract miniature and also encased within the 
				  common jewelry zip bag...i am eager and receive a
				  ten from my twenty disappointed at the nnumber of
				  visible seeds well at least they are visible and
				  not embedded into the bud like a surprise in a 
				  cracker jack box...i walk away and awake - it's
				  seven in the morning, i'm nearing the mid-way 
				  mark of the tenant of wildfell hall...i will
				  carry on with it as the start of my day, then 
				  mix the new recording i did yesterday before
				  guitar ritual when i again strummed through
				  the aforementioned song yet did not sing it
				  for the smoke filled room and upset stomach...
				  i had viewed unknown number the high school
				  catfish, which proves frailty thy name is
				  woman might yet hold ground, hail willy shakes -
